Planting the Seeds of Africa’s Growth
WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA – After decades of bad news, at least three major trends are turning Africa’s way: agricultural policies, rural demography, and farm productivity all promise improved opportunities for farm families across the continent.
These trends move too slowly to make headlines, but cumulatively they offer a whole new world of bigger payoffs from public and private investment in agriculture and rural development.
Each country in every year faces a unique set of circumstances.
Novelties get the most attention, like the possibility that outside investors might control large areas of farmland.
Spatial diversity is also important, because it ensures that each place differs from the aggregate average.
For Africa as a whole, however, at least three slow trends have recent turning points that offer game-changing new incentives for entrepreneurs and governments.
The first turning point is political.
New data from a World Bank study that compares farm policies around the world since 1955 shows for the first time just how far today’s African governments have gone to reduce the cost to farmers of the export taxes, marketing boards, and other interventions imposed by previous regimes (www.worldbank.org/agdistortions).
Africa’s policy-induced price distortions peaked in the late 1970’s, and reforms since then have removed about two-thirds of that burden, greatly facilitating productivity growth and poverty alleviation.
Further reforms could yield additional benefits, but much of the handicap imposed on African farmers by post-colonial governments has now been removed.
The second transition is demographic.
Census data compiled in recent revisions of United Nations population projections reveal the slowly unfolding implications of African history.
African households obtained access to modern medicine much later and more suddenly than people in other regions.
The resulting improvement in child survival rates and population growth during the 1970’s and 1980’s were faster than those seen earlier in Asia or Latin America.
Africa’s towns and cities have been growing at some of the world’s fastest rates, but their absolute size is so small that they can absorb only a fraction of all new workers.
Consequently, Africa’s rural population has been growing faster and for longer than any other in human history, with a correspondingly rapid and prolonged decline in per-capita endowments of land and other natural resources.
Moreover, post-independence improvements in child survival triggered a rise in child dependency rates, which also reached historically unprecedented levels in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
Africa’s demographic burdens began to lighten in the 1990’s, thanks to gradual reduction in fertility rates and continued urbanization.
As seen earlier in Asia, the slowdown in rural population growth and the reduced burden of childcare creates a window of opportunity for new investment to bring larger year-on-year increases in output per capita.
The third turning point in this sequence is technological: national estimates of cereal crop productivity show how, after decades of stagnation during the Asian green revolution, African yields have grown steadily over the past decade, so that estimated cereal grain output per capita now equals that of South Asia.
The start of this turnaround could be associated with the other two trends, as the cumulative result of more favorable policies and increased labor per hectare, but it could also reflect the gradual spread of improved crop varieties that resulted from earlier investment in agricultural technology.
The inflow of foreign aid to boost agricultural production did not rise until after the world food crisis of the 1970’s, and it peaked in the late 1980’s, yielding payoffs some years later.
Taken together, African politics, demography, and the delayed arrival of new technologies imposed severe headwinds against per-capita growth of agricultural output in the last quarter of the twentieth century.
But, looking forward, as these headwinds fade, faster growth and poverty alleviation are becoming easier to achieve.
Of course there is no guarantee of further progress.
The engines of growth include public and private investment, particularly for the new technologies needed to raise farm productivity.
Past efforts have been victims of their own success: as the burst of worldwide agricultural research and development in the 1970’s and 1980’s led to global food abundance in the 1990’s and 2000’s, foreign-aid donors turned to other priorities, and their per-capita support for African agriculture fell to a historical low in 2006 of around one dollar per year.
The global food crisis of 2007-2008 brought a brutal end to that complacency, and many investors have pledged a renewed focus on agriculture, but the proof will be in the spending.
African agriculture continues to face serious challenges.
Soil nutrients are being depleted, soil moisture is falling, temperatures are rising, and disease pressures are worsening.
Fortunately, a growing arsenal of solutions is available through local innovations that are increasingly well adapted to Africa’s unique needs.
Generalizations and predictions rarely survive for long on a continent as diverse and volatile as Africa is.
But African countries do have some things in common: widespread improvements in farm policy, improved demographic conditions, and the availability of new technologies create new opportunities for the decade ahead.
These three mega-trends put African farmers in a better position than ever before to take advantage of increased public and private investment.
As the obstacles created by previous government policies and past population growth are gradually removed, adopting successful innovations will yield increasingly large payoffs and faster per-capita growth over time.
For investors, the deepest obstacles are informational: what works best, and under which circumstances?
New data sources about relative impacts are becoming available, and are desperately needed.
Governments, donors, and other investors can still make bad choices, but there are unprecedented opportunities for high-payoff growth.
If funders take notice, farmers are poised to respond – and 2010 could mark the start of a bright new era in African agriculture.

Four Certainties About Populist Economics
MILAN – Successful economic globalization requires reasonably successful growth patterns in individual countries.
That dynamic characterized the 30 years or so after World War II: growth rates were relatively high across a wide range of countries; their benefits were broadly shared within countries; and the rise of developing countries reduced global inequality.
This period was arguably the heyday of globalization.
Of course, globalization continued through the 1970s and beyond.
But the underlying growth patterns changed.
Driven by the labor arbitrage embedded in economic globalization and the rise of disruptive digital technologies, advanced economies’ middle-class manufacturing jobs disappeared, their median incomes stagnated, and job and income polarization grew, even as GDP growth remained strong.
This new pattern – which persisted through the 1980s and 1990s, and accelerated after 2000 – caused inequality to rise sharply, weakening the foundations of globalization.
Countries’ responses have varied widely.
Some have taken steps to reduce inequality, such as redistribution through the tax system, social security and education systems, various kinds of social protection, and support for effective retraining.
The potency of such efforts tends to be shaped by cultural norms, the institutional bargaining power of labor, the level of trust between labor and business, and the influence of individual and corporate wealth on politics.
In countries with weaker mitigating forces – particularly the United States and the United Kingdom – disparities of income, wealth, and opportunity became the most extreme.
The lack of any substantial policy response, together with the apparent lack of concern from those whose economic bargaining power had increased, incited deep anger among those most affected.
Beyond the distributional issues that many countries face, Japan, parts of Europe, and some developing countries are confronting weak growth and persistently high unemployment.
In Europe’s case, these problems are rooted in a system with few escape valves and adjustment mechanisms.
But the fact remains that persistent non-inclusive growth has lately been transforming economies.
In such situations, the circuit breaker is political, and often dramatic.
Outside of developed democracies, persistent lapses in inclusiveness are nearly always devastating for long-term growth and development, and often lead to violence and civil strife – a tendency that the Growth Report of the Commission on Growth and Development highlighted several years ago.
In functioning democracies, the political drama usually remains confined to elections and referenda – such as the British vote to leave the European Union and the US presidential election, won by the populist outsider Donald Trump.
Disaffected voters reject the systems that produced the deficiencies.
This is a normal and healthy response.
And, absent a tectonic shift in growth dynamics and policies, we may well see more of it in the next few years in Europe – specifically, in France, Italy, and Germany.
It may be too late to persuade voters not to reject the existing systems, but there is still time to build effective alternatives.
The potential upside to the tremendous uncertainty that many around the world feel is that we essentially are confronted with a clean slate.
With previous presumptions, biases, and taboos having been erased, it may be possible to create something better.
Consider the US.
New growth patterns and policies could take many directions, including the rejection of multilateralism, in favor of bilateralism or protectionism; immigration-policy shifts; expanded public investment and fiscal stimulus; regulatory changes; tax reform; or supply-side measures in education, training, and health care.
There are risks and potential benefits in all of these areas, and the results will depend on the entire policy package.
While the potential combinations remain bewildering at this stage, a few things are clear.
First, when it comes to investment, consumer spending, and employment growth, expectations and confidence matter.
Hints that more robust and balanced policy responses are coming have had a noticeably positive effect, though it may be transitory, depending on implementation.
The uptick in expectations is reflected in financial markets, though many, including me, believe that current asset valuations are too optimistic.
Second, it seems likely that nominal growth in the US will rise, though the underlying mix of inflation and real growth is yet to be determined.
This matters, because it will shape the US Federal Reserve’s response, affecting asset prices in America and beyond.
One possibility is that expanded public and private investment begins to reverse the downward productivity trend, thereby generating real growth.
But the return of gridlock in Congress could short-circuit this trend and put a damper on expectations, while growth-constraining secular trends like demographics are not just going to disappear.
A third feature of America’s new growth pattern is likely to be added pressure on large companies to maintain their reputations within the US.
Even before his inauguration, Trump was trying to influence companies’ choices about manufacturing locations, including by threatening import tariffs on products manufactured in, say, Mexico.
While Trump has made deals to keep some jobs in the US, such as the agreement with Carrier, his more powerful tactic has been to threaten companies’ brand image, including via Twitter.
Some characterize Trump’s efforts – and his Twitter forays, in particular – as more style than substance, unlikely to have any longer-term quantitative impact.
They may be right.
But, in my view, Trump seems to be sending a deeper message about corporate decision-making.
Despite Trump’s own business record – which, his opponents will point out, includes multiple bankruptcies and non-payment of contractors and their workers – it’s possible that he is now trying to change a business and investment culture that elevates the interests of capital, corporations, and shareholders, and treats labor as expendable.
The fourth trend we can count on is the continued march of digital technology.
That, however, is where the certainty ends: the Trump administration has so far offered few, if any, signals about how it will approach the issue of supporting adaptation by the workforce.
In the next few months, we will learn more about whether the recent uptick in economic optimism is robust; whether Trump’s efforts to fight offshoring and boost growth and employment have a long-term impact; and whether protectionism prevails.
Only then can we determine whether Trump really was the right economic choice for America’s disaffected workers.

When Agricultural Workers Go Hungry
GENEVA – Food is a powerful storyteller.
Our diet signals whether we cook at home, shop locally, prefer inexpensive dishes, or even think about what we eat.
But the consumer side of mealtime is just one of food’s many plot lines.
Food has backstories, too, none more unsavory than this one: agricultural workers – the people who make dinner possible – are also the most likely to go to bed hungry.
Every day, some 1.1 billion people – one-third of the global workforce – go to work at the world’s farms.
And, every night, many of them return home – having suffered countless violations of their human rights – without enough money to feed themselves or their families.
Farm work is one of the only professions in which national legal protections are regularly ignored.
Minimum wage standards endorsed by the International Labor Organization (ILO), and adopted by many industries around the world, remain either unenforced in the agriculture sector or do not extend to informal farm workers.
But, because migrant labor makes up the bulk of the agricultural workforce, this gap in coverage has become a canyon.
In rural parts of developing countries, 80% of farm workers earn less than $1.25 per day, trapping them in poverty.
Additionally, piece-rate pay schemes force workers to spend hours in extreme weather to meet demanding quotas.
Worst of all, those working on unethical farms do so at high risk.
According to the ILO, dangerous machinery, long working hours, and exposure to toxic pesticides makes farm work one of the world’s deadliest jobs; more than 170,000 agricultural workers are killed every year on unsafe farms, twice the mortality rate of any other industry.
And yet, agricultural work is typically excluded from occupational health and safety rules in most countries.
Even in the United States, there is no federal law mandating that employers give farm workers breaks for water and shade, even though heatstroke remains a leading cause of work-related farm deaths in the US.
The recent death of Fabián Tomasi, an Argentine farm worker and critic of the agrochemical industry in his country, was a reminder of the hazards of industrialized agriculture.
While companies like Monsanto argue that pesticides are necessary to ensure food security, the consequences of chemical exposure to workers like Tomasi – whose body was left twisted and mangled after years of handling chemicals without protection – reveal the human cost of their use.
Even in developed countries, acute pesticide poisoning affects one in every 5,000 agricultural workers, and countless more employees are exposed to toxins on a daily basis.
Unfortunately, few agricultural workers are in a position to advocate for their rights.
Seasonal and rural workers lack access to collective bargaining, and undocumented migrant workers avoid unions for fear that employers will retaliate by calling the immigration authorities.
Moreover, basic benefits such as social security, health care, and workers’ compensation are typically nonexistent.
Exempt from much workplace regulation, this is an industry that can afford to put cost-savings and profits above the wellbeing of employees.
It is time for us to stop passively sticking a fork into what lands on our plates, and use our purchasing power to resist paying the cheapest price for food.
Holding people accountable for mistreating farm workers will be challenging, but not impossible.
We can begin by calling on governments to spend more time protecting farm workers than investigating their immigration status.
Of course, for this to be possible, we need more information about where our food comes from.
Nowadays, we tend to rely on informational labels and certifications to tell us that.
But the story they tell is fragmented, incomplete, and at times even misleading.
We need to take the extra steps to learn the full story.
This means moving beyond voluntary labels declaring that food is produced fairly and humanely to demand mandatory labels that expose non-compliance with these norms.
Worldwide, some 821 million people are undernourished – a figure that continues to increase.
This is a tragedy; no one anywhere should have their rights, including the right to food, violated; yet that is exactly what so many farm workers and food-chain workers endure every day.
Fighting for their rights has always been difficult, but if we continue the battle, the story of the global food system may lose some of its bitterness.

Cancer by the Numbers
PHILADELPHIA – It is difficult to communicate medical risk to a large audience, especially when official recommendations conflict with emotional narratives.
That is why, when the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2009 presented its guidelines for breast cancer screening, which recommended against routine screenings for asymptomatic women in their 40’s and biennial, rather than annual, mammograms for women over 50, the public responded with confused fury.
The key to understanding this response is to be found in the nebulous zone between mathematics and psychology.
People’s discomfort with the findings stemmed largely from faulty intuition: if earlier and more frequent screening increases the likelihood of detecting a possibly fatal cancer, then more screening is always desirable.
If more screening can detect breast cancer in asymptomatic women in their 40’s, wouldn’t it also detect cancer in women in their 30’s?
And, if so, why not, reductio ad absurdum, begin monthly mammograms at age 15?
The answer, of course, is that such intensive screening would cause more harm than good.
But striking the proper balance is challenging.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to weigh breast cancer’s dangers against the cumulative effects of radiation from dozens of mammograms over the years, the invasiveness of biopsies, and the debilitating impact of treating slow-growing tumors that would never have proven fatal.
The USPSTF recently issued an even sharper warning about the prostate-specific antigen test for prostate cancer, after concluding that the test’s harms outweigh its benefits.
Chest X-rays for lung cancer and Pap tests for cervical cancer have received similar, albeit less definitive, criticism.
The next step in the reevaluation of cancer screening was taken last year, when researchers at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy announced that the costs of screening for breast cancer were often minimized, and that the benefits were much exaggerated.
Indeed, even a mammogram (almost 40 million are given annually in the US) that detects a cancer does not necessarily save a life.
The Dartmouth researchers found that, of the estimated 138,000 breast cancers detected annually in the US, the test did not help 120,000-134,000 of the afflicted women.
The cancers either were growing so slowly that they did not pose a problem, or they would have been treated successfully if discovered clinically later (or they were so aggressive that little could be done).
A related concern is measurement.
Since the patient’s duration of survival is calculated from the time of diagnosis, more sensitive screening starts the clock sooner.
Survival times can thus appear longer, even if the earlier diagnosis had no real effect on survival.
Naturally, individual cases dictate which tests and treatments are best, but an additional concern about frequent screenings is the problem of false positives.
When one is looking for something relatively rare (whether cancer or terrorists), it is wise to remember that a positive result is often false.
Either the “detected” pathology is not there, or it is not the sort that will kill you.
Consider the following hypothetical example.
Assume that the screening test for a certain cancer is 95% accurate, meaning that if someone has the cancer, the test will be positive 95% of the time.
Next, assume that if someone does not have the cancer, the test will be positive only 1% of the time.
Finally, assume further that 0.5% of people – one of every 200 – actually have this type of cancer.
If your doctor tells you that you have tested positive, does this mean that you are likely to have the cancer?
Surprisingly, the answer is no.
A little arithmetic shows why.
Suppose that 100,000 screenings are conducted.
On average, 500 people will have the cancer.
Since 95% of them will test positive, there will be, on average, 475 positive tests.
Of the 99,500 people without cancer, 1% will test positive, yielding 995 false positives out of 1,470 positive tests.
In other words, even if you tested positive for the cancer, the probability that you actually have it is only about 32%.
That answer is decidedly counterintuitive and hence easy to reject.
Most people do not think in terms of probabilities other than “50-50” and “one in a million.”
But, whatever the probabilities, the fact remains that there will generally be a high percentage of false positives when screening for rare conditions.
Moreover, the patients who receive these faulty diagnoses will usually receive further treatments, which often will have harmful consequences.
The “availability heuristic” – a pervasive cognitive bias caused by people’s tendency to estimate the likelihood of a phenomenon by how easily an example of it comes to mind – routinely clouds the issue.
People relate much more readily to a friend dying of cancer than they do to statistics about strangers suffering from the consequences of testing.
But the bottom line is that the ongoing reevaluation of cancer screening is evidence-based.
When it comes to policymaking, decisions must be based on facts and argument, not anecdotes and stories, however compelling those narratives may be.

North Korea’s Choice
NEW YORK – When the Republic of Korea was established in 1948, Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world.
GDP per capita was US$67 in 1953, immediately following the Korean War, and rose to only US$79 in 1960.
At that time, North Korea’s economy was much stronger than that of the South.
Natural resources were abundant in the North, and even electricity was supplied from North to South.
Most industry was located in the North, whereas the South was mainly agricultural.
Today, the South’s GDP is 40 times larger than that of the North.
Comparing the two Korean economies is virtually meaningless.
Such disparities do not arise from different historical experiences, because Koreans have shared a history for thousands of years as one nation.
The gap, instead, reflects recent historical choices.
By persistently adhering to a planned economy and obsolete ideology, North Korea is trapped in a vicious cycle, suffering from unstable food supplies and low, or sometimes negative, economic growth.
Nonetheless, North Korea has shown little interest in reform.
Instead, it has developed a nuclear weapons program that threatens stability in the region and places a heavy burden on its economy.
South Korea, which is enjoying unprecedented prosperity, is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with North Koreans’ economic despair.
Probably no two neighboring countries have such a huge economic gap, let alone countries that share the same ethnic and historical background.
The danger is that such a discrepancy can become a source of instability and conflict.
To overcome its economic deficiencies and attain social stability, the North has no choice but to abandon its nuclear weapons program and move toward reform and greater openness.
South Korea is trying to persuade the North to make this strategic decision.
We are more than willing to help the North achieve economic growth, which is almost always the source of peace and security.
As such, North Korea’s economic recovery is vital for an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula.
So, in accordance with the Six-Party Talks (North and South Korea, the United States, Russia, China, and Japan) my government wants to create a Korean Economic Community in collaboration with the North.
In cooperation with the international community, we will help North Korea raise its annual per capita income to US$3,000.
To this end, we will carry out joint projects in five key areas: education, finance, industrial infrastructure, quality of life, and economic development.
But an institutional mechanism is needed to implement this initiative, such as an inter-Korean consultative body.
Of course, mere economic assistance or investment is not sufficient for a country to bail itself out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and poverty.
A national economy can take off only when the necessary infrastructure, an adequate level of competition, and reasonable government policies are in place.
We know how difficult it is to achieve such conditions, because we had to do it ourselves.
Our vision for an inter-Korean economic community is based on sharing our experiences with the North.
True, inter-Korean relations have already expanded. But this expansion has not brought fundamental change to the two Koreas’ relationship.
An incident at Mt. Geumgang last July demonstrated the relationship’s vulnerable nature.
A middle-aged South Korean female tourist was shot to death while walking on the beach, having inadvertently crossed over the boundary of the tourist zone.
No North-South dialogue has emerged to investigate the incident, or to prevent a recurrence.
Under these circumstances, there are greater calls in South Korea for a new approach towards the North.
We now believe that inter-Korean relations should conform to principles and standards that any member of the international community should respect.
Another key consideration is to consolidate a sustainable peace structure on the Korean Peninsula.
This cannot merely be a state of affairs like the current one, in which hostilities are absent. It refers to an enduring peace, which is not easily affected by incidents or accidents and is able to prevent politico-military crises such as that caused by the North’s nuclear program.
The only way to realize such a peace is by completing North Korea’s denuclearization and establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.
As of today, the Six-Party Talks is the principal framework to open up the future of the North.
If the North abandons its nuclear weapons program, many benefits can be gained.
Relations between the North and its neighbors can improve, along with a greater probability of forming a Northeast Asia peace and security mechanism.
Fortunately, America’s removal of North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism has re-started the denuclearization process.
But the North’s prior threat to resume work at the facilities suggests that this process may be fitful.
Moreover, since South Korea’s new government took office earlier this year little progress has been made in relations between the two Koreas.
But our vision will eventually open up ways to solve North Korea’s problems, not only bringing a better future for the North, but also making the Korean Peninsula a gateway for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia.
Leaders in the North may mistakenly believe that they can circumvent or outmaneuver the South – the so-called strategy of driving a wedge between the Republic of Korea and the US.
But in the end, South Korea is the neighbor whom the North can truly trust and rely on the most.
The North should realize this and make a wise choice.

Sorry for Nothing
NEW YORK – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is once again stirring Asia’s cauldron of national rivalries and historical resentments.
This time, he has instructed a committee of historians to reexamine the official apology delivered in 1993 to World War II-era sex slaves held in Japanese military brothels.
It is clear from various recent statements that some of Abe’s closest advisers believe that the apology was not in order, so the committee might well conclude that Japan was never officially involved in prostitution, and that its “sincere remorse” should therefore be withdrawn.
What perverse reason could Abe have for pursuing such an outcome?
Glossing over, or denying, dark chapters of national history is not unique to Japan, of course.
There is no room for Stalin’s mass murders in the kind of “patriotic” education favored by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
And the Tiananmen Square Massacre, to name but one bloody event in China’s recent past, has been officially forgotten.
Still, Japan is a democracy, with freedom of expression.
The official apology made in 1993 was prompted by a Japanese historian’s discovery of documents showing that the Imperial Japanese Army had been directly involved in setting up, though not necessarily in running, what were known as “comfort stations.”
One of the official reasons was that widespread rape of Chinese women by Japanese soldiers was provoking too much resistance among the local population.
Various means were used to stock the brothels with young women.
But, because there was no escape, the women, once ensnared in the system, were effectively slaves.
This has been officially admitted, so why reopen the ghastly business now, at a time when rescinding the apology would make Japan’s already-strained relations with China and South Korea many times worse?
If Abe and his allies were cosmopolitan in their outlook, with a deep understanding of, or concern for, other countries, the decision to revisit the 1993 apology would indeed be extraordinary.
But, as is true of many political leaders, especially on the nationalistic right, they are chauvinistic provincials whose concerns are almost entirely domestic.
In their efforts to revise the historical record, they are not really thinking of Koreans or Chinese, but of political adversaries at home.
The views of the Japanese on their country’s wartime history are deeply divided, reflecting political battle lines drawn in the immediate aftermath of the war, when Japan was under Allied occupation.
The United States, which ran the occupation, was keen to reform Japanese society in such a way that another war would be unthinkable.
Worship of the emperor was abolished, though Hirohito remained on his throne.
Education was purged of all militaristic and “feudal” elements, including favorable references to the samurai spirit.
A new pacifist constitution, written by the Americans, banned the use of armed force.
And Japan’s wartime leaders were tried in Tokyo by Allied judges for “crimes against peace” and “crimes against humanity.”
Most Japanese, heartily sick of war and military bullying, were happy to go along with all of this.
But there was always a right-wing minority that felt humiliated and resentful of the loss of national pride and, more important, national sovereignty, for Japan’s security would henceforth have to depend entirely on the protection offered by the US.
One of the main leaders of this group of disgruntled nationalists was Nobusuke Kishi, Abe’s grandfather.
Kishi’s aim was to regain Japanese pride and sovereignty by revising the constitution and reviving old-fashioned patriotism, thus undoing some of the American educational reforms.
He failed, because most Japanese were still allergic to anything that smacked of militarism.
Until not long ago, there was a strong left-wing current in education and some of the media that used Japan’s horrendous wartime record as an argument against any kind of revisionism.
But, as long as the Japanese left used history to make this political argument, the nationalists pushed back by claiming that stories of wartime atrocities had been greatly exaggerated.
Books about the infamous Nanking Massacre of 1937, or the enslavement of “comfort women” in military brothels, were denounced as “historical masochism” or dismissed as “the Tokyo Trial View of History.”
The left was accused of being complicit in spreading foreign – Chinese, Korean, or American – propaganda.
This, then, is the modern Japanese version of populism: the “liberal elites,” by falsifying the history of Japan’s glorious war to “liberate Asia,” undermined the Japanese people’s moral fiber.
Because the ideological collapse of left-wing politics in Japan has been as precipitous as in much of the Western world, the so-called liberal elites have lost much of their former influence.
As a result, the voice of the nationalist right has grown louder in recent years.
That is why Abe can get away with appointing cronies to the board of NHK, the national broadcasting company, who openly claim that the military brothels were an entirely private enterprise and that the Nanking Massacre was a foreign fabrication.
Historical truth is not the point; political mastery is.
Japan’s prime minister is playing a risky game.
He is upsetting allies in Asia, embarrassing the US, and making bad relations with China even worse.
Like Putin, he is driving himself and his country into further isolation for entirely domestic reasons.
In a region increasingly dominated by Chinese power, he will be without Asian friends.
And that is where Abe’s behavior becomes truly perverse.
After all, a Japan that is isolated in Asia will be even more dependent on the US, the wartime victor, which Abe and his nationalist allies hold responsible for the postwar order that they seek to revise.

Optimism for the New Year
NEW YORK – The year 2020 was a harrowing one, with the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide economic reversals, widespread climate-related disasters, pervasive social unrest, and even US President Donald Trump’s phony claims about massive electoral fraud and calls among his backers for martial law.
Yet, despite the grim news, the year also brought some powerful reasons for optimism.
In the coming year, we can lay the foundations for a new era of sustainable development, peace, and cooperation.
The first reason for optimism was the success of many countries in suppressing COVID-19.
Countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region, as varied culturally and politically as Australia, China, South Korea, Laos, New Zealand, and Vietnam, deployed effective public health strategies to contain the pandemic.
So, too, did some countries in other regions, including in Sub-Saharan Africa.
While the headlines were dominated by the disastrous shortcomings of the pandemic response in the United States and Europe, the successes in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere show us how the combination of good governance, a responsible citizenry, and evidence-based policies can solve big and urgent challenges.
The second reason for optimism is the arrival of new vaccines, which are not only a source of great hope for saving lives and stopping the virus, but also a sign of the power of modern science to deliver technological breakthroughs in record time.
The vaccine development exemplified the “mission approach” of targeting research and development in a public-private effort.
The same mission approach should be deployed to address other global challenges, such as boosting renewable energy, sustainable farming, and the conservation of biodiversity.
The third reason for optimism is that Trump was decisively defeated in the November election.
Like many demagogues of the past and present, Trump was able to generate a broad public following with the backing of mass propaganda, especially Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News.
Yet enough of the public saw through the lies and smears to enable the US to make a new start after Trump’s disastrous reign of ineptitude, hatred, and lies.
Trump’s ignorance and lying contributed to more than 330,000 US deaths from COVID-19 in 2020, roughly one-quarter of the world’s deaths from the virus, though the US accounts for only 4% of the world’s population.
Trump’s disastrous mishandling of COVID-19 ultimately led to his election defeat, yet even then Trump tried to maintain power by making desperate and delusional claims about widespread voter fraud.
Fortunately, both the public and US institutions – mayors, governors, state legislatures, courts, and the military – resisted Trump’s authoritarian impulses, so that President-elect Joe Biden, a decent, honorable, and rational man, will soon be inaugurated.
The fourth reason for optimism is the United Nations’ strong performance, despite the powerful headwinds in 2020.
The UN was ushered into existence 75 years ago by America’s greatest president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as a bulwark against future wars.
It defends the three pillars of multilateralism: peace, human rights, and sustainable development.
In 2020, it performed admirably on all three fronts, despite the provocations from the Trump administration.
The UN agencies today are led by men and women of great skill and integrity, and Secretary-General António Guterres has guided the organization with enormous skill and vision during the toughest year since it was founded.
In 2021, the UN will host several crucial global gatherings – on oceans, biodiversity, foods systems, and climate – that together can lay the foundations for decades of global cooperation on sustainable development.
The fifth reason for optimism is the digital revolution, the leading unspoken protagonist of the global pandemic response.
Online activities kept the world functioning.
Within weeks, businesses, schools, finance, government, commerce, payments, health-care providers, and the UN system went online at a rate, scope, and depth unimaginable until that point.
The digital technologies played a direct role in fighting the epidemic, providing information, monitoring disease transmission patterns, and providing multiple health-system services.
Obviously, the new digital world has not been an unalloyed paradise.
Distressingly, half the world still lacks Internet access.
As a result, the rapid shift of work, school, social life, commerce, and entertainment to online platforms fueled dramatic inequalities between the Internet haves and have-nots.
Moreover, digital technologies have given rise to other new and serious social ills, including large-scale hacking, fake news, cyberwarfare, and unwarranted surveillance by governments and private companies.
The two faces of the digital age, positive and negative, exemplify the situation we face on many fronts.
We can be optimistic knowing that the world’s cutting-edge technologies and scientific knowledge empower us to solve pressing global problems.
Yet we must also be vigilant to stop the forces of greed, ignorance, and hatred from hijacking the new technologies for their ulterior purposes.
The ancient Greek philosophers believed that politics and ethics must go hand in hand.
Aristotle wrote two of his masterworks, the Nicomachean Ethics and The Politics, as companion studies, the first as a guide to human happiness and the latter as a guide to how politics can promote happiness in the Greek city-state (the polis).
In our time, Pope Francis has presented two great encyclicals, Laudato si’ in 2015 and Fratelli tutti in 2020, to show how ethics can help guide the world to environmental sustainability and global peace.
The new encyclical offers a profound description of how we can reach beyond our own families, communities, and countries to build dialogue and trust around the world.
So, let us enter 2021 with real yet cautious optimism.
Let us resolve to extend the public-health successes of the Asia-Pacific region and the new vaccines developed in the US, Europe, Russia, and China to benefit the entire world.
Let us resolve to set aside the hatreds that have undermined global cooperation, and join forces to overcome the inequality, poverty, exclusion, and environmental destruction that threatens the world.
Let us redouble our support for the UN, to build a future based on peace, human rights, and sustainable development.
And for those in the US, let us begin to heal a wounded and divided nation.

Africa Needs Traditional Media
ABUJA – In June, Senegalese President Macky Sall’s brother, Aliou Sall, resigned from his post as the head of a state-run savings fund, following public outrage over allegations (which he denies) that he was involved in corrupt oil and gas deals.
That outrage was expressed via social media and on the streets of Dakar.
But it was investigative journalism, carried out by the BBC, that triggered it, highlighting traditional media’s enduring power to effect change.
While social-media platforms get a lot of attention for their speed and accessibility, a credible free press – which does not simply parrot the official line of governments or special interests, but rather seeks the truth – remains essential to strengthening accountability in places where it can often be hard to find.
And independent investigative journalists in Africa have often exposed high-level corruption, abuse of power, and shady business deals.
For example, in Kenya, a leading local newspaper reported that Philip Kinisu, former chairman of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, had received suspicious payments from the National Youth Service.
Further investigations into the NYS revealed more corrupt deals, spurring Kenyans to take to the streets in protest.
But those with power know how to fight back – and they do not pull their punches.
As a result, in many African countries, the free press is being compromised, suppressed, and even dismantled.
The most extreme example of media suppression in Africa is found in Eritrea, where Reporters Without Borders estimates that at least 11 journalists are languishing in prison.
The country has only one independent and non-partisan news outlet – a radio station run by exiled journalists, based in Paris – and its signal is often jammed.
But attacks on African news media’s already-tenuous freedom are proliferating.
They often come in the form of violence against independent journalists.
Last year, two journalists in Nigeria were assaulted by security operatives attached to the president.
In January, an undercover journalist in Ghana was fatally shot, after a politician called for retribution against him for publishing an exposé on corruption in the country’s football (soccer) leagues.
Governments also attempt to assert control over media outlets, even if it means shutting them down.
In Tanzania, President John Magufuli’s government has suspended newspapers and banned radio stations critical of his administration, using pretexts such as “sedition” and “national security threats.”
News organizations have been pressured – in at least one case, by armed men – to publish stories favorable to the ruling elite.
Independent media are squeezed further by chronic underfunding.
Journalists not only lack resources to support their work; they are often so poorly compensated that they become vulnerable to corruption themselves.
In Nigeria, “brown envelope journalism” – when reporters are paid by individuals or organizations to publish favorable stories – is commonplace.
Where independent media are silenced, coerced, or captured, the public has few options for gaining any information beyond the narratives pushed by governments and special interests.
Social-media platforms can play a role, but their main strength – their democratic nature – is also their fatal flaw.
They have proved ideal for spreading fake news, which taints public debate and erodes trust in both facts and institutions.
This dynamic was on stark display during Nigeria’s last election campaign.
Fake news stories – including the claim that President Muhammadu Buhari had died and been replaced by a lookalike – went viral on social media.
Millions of Nigerians were convinced, with some even carrying out killings in retaliation for made-up violence.
Recognizing the power of these stories, figures close to political parties began to invent and circulate claims that would benefit their candidates, severely distorting the election campaign.
Independent traditional news outlets do not just avoid this problem; they are the key to addressing it, because only they can credibly verify the news being circulated on social media.
That is why Facebook and Google have collaborated with traditional media organizations to combat the spread of fake news on their platforms in Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe.
But if traditional independent media are going to fulfill their essential role, they need resources.
In places where governments are placing constraints on press freedom, Western donors should step up to provide the necessary funding.
Given the importance of a credible free press to both development and democracy, it is undoubtedly a sound investment.

Putin’s Medieval Dreams
ATLANTA – While much of the world is busy dismantling monuments to oppressors, Russians are moving in the opposite direction, erecting statues to medieval warlords who were famous for their despotism.
Understanding this revival can shed light on the direction of Russia’s politics.
In October 2016, with the endorsement of Russia’s culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, the country’s first-ever monument to Ivan the Terrible was unveiled in the city of Orel.
A month later, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, called for Lenin Avenue in Moscow to be renamed Ivan the Terrible Highway.
And in July of this year, President Vladimir Putin christened Moscow’s own tribute to the tyrant, declaring, erroneously, that “most likely, Ivan the Terrible never killed anyone, not even his son.”
Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.
He also presided over Russia’s defeat in the Livonian War, and his misrule contributed to the Time of Troubles and the state’s devastating depopulation.
Joseph Stalin initiated the modern cult of Ivan the Terrible.
But, since the mid-2000s, Russia’s Eurasia Party – a political movement led by the pro-fascist mystic Alexander Dugin – has moved to position Ivan as the best incarnation of an “authentic” Russian tradition: authoritarian monarchy.
Dugin’s brand of “Eurasianism” advocates the embrace of a “new Middle Ages,” where what little remains of Russian democracy is replaced by an absolute autocrat.
In Dugin’s ideal future, a medieval social order would return, the empire would be restored, and the Orthodox church would assume control over culture and education.
Eurasianism, which was marginal in the 1990s, has gained considerable popularity in recent years by contributing to the formation of the so-called Izborsky Club, which unites the Russian far right.
On several occasions, Putin has referred to Eurasianism as an important part of Russian ideology; he has even invoked it as a founding principle of the “Eurasian Economic Union,” a burgeoning trade area of former Soviet states.
Eurasianism has given ultra-nationalist groups common ground around which to unite.
It has also given symbols of totalitarianism, like Ivan the Terrible and Stalin, new legions of support.
Chief among them are members of the Eurasia Party, who consider political terror the most effective tool of governance and call for a “new oprichnina” – a staunchly anti-Western Eurasian conservative revolution.
According to Mikhail Yuriev, a member of the political council of the Eurasia Party and author of the utopian novel The Third Empire, the oprichniks should be the only political class, and they should rule by fear.
Ivan the Terrible is not the only medieval vestige being revived in Russia.
Cultural vocabulary is also reverting.
For example, the word kholop, which means “serf,” is returning to the vernacular, a linguistic devolution that parallels a troubling rise in Russia’s modern slavery.
Data from the Global Slavery Index show that more than one million Russians are currently enslaved in the construction industry, the military, agriculture, and the sex trade.
Moreover, serf “owners” are also happily identifying themselves as modern-day barins.
Even Russian officials speak approvingly of modern slavery.
Valery Zorkin, who chairs the Constitutional Court, wrote in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the official government newspaper, that serfdom has long been a “social glue” for Russia.
And another medieval term – lydi gosudarevy, which translates to “servants of his majesty” – has returned to favor among high-ranking bureaucrats.
Nostalgia for serfdom compliments the desire for a return to autocracy.
Prominent Russian intellectuals – including the filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov, journalist Maksim Sokolov, and Vsevolod Chaplin, a Russian Orthodox cleric – call for the coronation of Putin, and petitions of support are gaining signatures online.
Significantly, the protests against Putin’s regime in 2012 have since been interpreted not as a protest against Putin himself, but rather against the social order to which Eurasianism aspires.
Putin’s tacit support for the Eurasian vision of a neo-medieval Russia invokes the historical memory of Stalinism.
According to Dugin, “Stalin created the Soviet Empire,” and, like Ivan the Terrible, expresses “the spirit of the Soviet society and the Soviet people.”
No wonder, then, that monuments to Stalin, too, are multiplying in Russian cities.
Neo-medievalism is rooted in nostalgia for a social order based on inequality, caste, and clan, enforced by terror.
The lionization of historical despots reflects the contemporary embrace of such pre-modern, radically anti-democratic and unjust values.
For Ivan’s contemporary champions, the past is prologue.

Putin’s Dance with the Taliban
NEW DELHI – Russia may be in decline economically and demographically, but, in strategic terms, it is a resurgent power, pursuing a major military rearmament program that will enable it to continue expanding its global influence.
One of the Kremlin’s latest geostrategic targets is Afghanistan, where the United States remains embroiled in the longest war in its history.
Almost three decades after the end of the Soviet Union’s own war in Afghanistan – a war that enfeebled the Soviet economy and undermined the communist state – Russia has moved to establish itself as a central actor in Afghan affairs.
And the Kremlin has surprised many by embracing the Afghan Taliban.
Russia had long viewed the thuggish force created by Pakistan’s rogue Inter-Services Intelligence agency as a major terrorist threat.
In 2009-2015, Russia served as a critical supply route for US-led forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan; it even contributed military helicopters to the effort.
Russia’s reversal on the Afghan Taliban reflects a larger strategy linked to its clash with the US and its European allies – a clash that has intensified considerably since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea spurred the US and Europe to impose heavy economic sanctions.
In fact, in a sense, Russia is exchanging roles with the US in Afghanistan.
In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan used Islam as an ideological tool to spur armed resistance to the Soviet occupation.
Reasoning that the enemy of their enemy was their friend, the CIA trained and armed thousands of Afghan mujahedeen – the jihadist force from which al-Qaeda and later the Taliban evolved.
Today, Russia is using the same logic to justify its cooperation with the Afghan Taliban, which it wants to keep fighting the unstable US-backed government in Kabul.
And the Taliban, which has acknowledged that it shares Russia’s enmity with the US, will take whatever help it can get to expel the Americans.
Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to impose significant costs on the US for its decision to maintain military bases in Afghanistan to project power in Central and Southwest Asia.
As part of its 2014 security agreement with the Afghan government, it has secured long-term access to at least nine bases to keep tabs on nearby countries, including Russia, which, according to Putin’s special envoy on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, “will never tolerate this.”
More broadly, Putin wants to expand the geopolitical chessboard, in the hope that he can gain sufficient leverage over the US and NATO to wrest concessions on stifling economic sanctions.
Putin believes that, by becoming a major player in Afghanistan, Russia can ensure that America needs its help to extricate itself from the war there.
This strategy aligns seamlessly with Putin’s approach in Syria, where Russia has already made itself a vital partner in any effort to root out the Islamic State (ISIS).
In cozying up to the Taliban, Putin is sending the message that Russia could destabilize the Afghan government in the same way the US, by aiding Syrian rebels, has undermined Bashar al-Assad’s Russian-backed regime.
Already, the Kremlin has implicitly warned that supply of Western anti-aircraft weapons to Syrian rebels would compel Russia to arm the Taliban with similar capabilities.
That could be a game changer in Afghanistan, where the Taliban now holds more territory than at any time since it was ousted from power in 2001.
Russia is involving more countries in its strategic game.
Beyond holding a series of direct meetings with the Afghan Taliban, Russia has hosted three rounds of trilateral Afghanistan-related discussions with Pakistan and China in Moscow.
A coalition to help the Afghan Taliban, comprising those three countries and Iran, is emerging.
General John Nicholson, the US military commander in Afghanistan, seeking the deployment of several thousand additional American troops, recently warned of the growing “malign influence” of Russia and other powers in the country.
Over the past year, Nicholson told the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Russia has been “overtly lending legitimacy to the Taliban to undermine NATO efforts and bolster belligerents using the false narrative that only the Taliban are fighting [ISIS].”
The reality, Nicholson suggested, is that Russia’s excuse for establishing intelligence-sharing arrangements with the Taliban is somewhat flimsy.
US-led raids and airstrikes have helped to contain ISIS fighters within Afghanistan.
In any case, those fighters have little connection to the Syria-headquartered group.
The Afghan ISIS comprises mainly Pakistani and Uzbek extremists who “rebranded” themselves and seized territory along the Pakistan border.
In some ways, it was the US itself that opened the way for Russia’s Afghan strategy.
President Barack Obama, in his attempt to reach a peace deal with the Taliban, allowed it to establish a de facto diplomatic mission in Qatar and then traded five senior Taliban leaders who had been imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay for a captured US Army sergeant.
In doing so, he bestowed legitimacy on a terrorist organization that enforces medieval practices in the areas under its control.
The US has also refused to eliminate militarily the Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan, even though, as Nicholson admitted, “[i]t is very difficult to succeed on the battlefield when your enemy enjoys external support and safe haven.”
On the contrary, Pakistan remains one of the world’s largest recipients of US aid.
Add to that the Taliban’s conspicuous exclusion from the US list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and it is difficult for the US credibly to condemn Russia’s overtures to the Taliban and ties with Pakistan.
The US military’s objective of compelling the Taliban to sue for “reconciliation” was always going to be difficult to achieve.
Now that Russia has revived the “Great Game” in Afghanistan, it may be impossible.

America’s Bickering Asian Allies
ATLANTA – American diplomats like to portray their country’s allies in glowing terms.
So the world should take note when they do not – such as when US Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, at a recent conference in Washington, DC, on Asian security, publicly scolded South Korea for its seemingly endless vilification of Japan.
According to Sherman, South Korea’s stance – reflected in its demand that Japan apologize, once again, for forcing Korean women to provide sexual services to the Imperial Army during World War II – has produced “paralysis, not progress.”
But Sherman’s criticism could also be leveled against Japan.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has rarely missed an opportunity to provoke Japan’s Korean critics, whether by visiting Tokyo’s Yasukuni shrine, where the “souls” of 14 Class A war criminals are interred, or embracing revisionist critiques of previous official apologies for Japanese aggression.
Instead of working together to help their American ally confront the challenges posed by a rising China and the North Korean nuclear threat, South Korea and Japan have allowed their rancor to stymie effective action.
This seemingly endless tension has been frustrating – and worrying – American leaders for years, especially as it has undermined the United States’ strategic “pivot” toward Asia.
Since President Barack Obama announced the pivot five years ago, the US has been attempting to bolster its forces and alliances in Asia, thereby reinforcing its strategic role in a region that China is increasingly attempting to dominate.
But the relentless sniping by its two most important Asian allies has blocked the kind of concrete cooperation needed to help it achieve its main goals, including ensuring a durable, long-term military presence in the region.
Intelligence sharing is a case in point.
In December, US officials, seeking to better their understanding of North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs – and enable commanders to react swiftly if potential threats materialize – announced a new information-sharing agreement with South Korea and Japan.
But the deal could be a script for a situation comedy: Japan and South Korea refuse to provide intelligence data to each other, leaving the US to play the middleman.
The US has accentuated the positive, calling the agreement an important step forward.
But, though it does represent progress from 2012, when popular opposition in South Korea to the idea of military cooperation with Japan caused a similar agreement to collapse, the latest effort is inefficient, at best.
China has been eager to capitalize on the animosity between Japan and South Korea to undermine America’s security interests in Asia.
During a visit to South Korea last July, President Xi Jinping highlighted not only the two countries’ deepening economic relationship, but also their shared views regarding Japan’s wartime past.
Other Chinese officials have picked up the theme, dropping hints that China’s 70th anniversary celebration of the end of World War II could exclude Japan – unless, that is, Japan is more contrite about its historic transgressions.
It is time for the US to tell its Asian allies to get over it.
As the underwriter of both Japan’s and South Korea’s national defense, the US simply cannot allow their historical animosities to impede action to address urgent threats in this critical region.
The timing could not be better, as rising security fears are altering public perceptions.
Recent opinion polls suggest that at least half of all South Koreans are worried enough about regional tensions to support closer military ties with Japan.
And, indeed, the security risks facing Asia are only growing – exemplified in China’s move from military expansion to blatant assertiveness.
Most notably, in the South and East China Seas, China has been staking its claim to disputed island territories, deploying advanced military hardware, and aggressively patrolling an expanded security zone.
Meanwhile, leaks from Chinese think tanks have suggested that if the North Korean regime collapses, China could well send troops to preserve the country’s stability.
Asia’s new security landscape places a premium on seamless cooperation among US allies – a prospect that the sustained bickering between South Korea and Japan calls into question.
It could even be said that their longstanding dispute makes America’s Asian alliance system worth less than the sum of its parts.
Repairing relations between South Korean and Japan could not be more urgent.
Even with good will on both sides, it will take time to build a strong defense partnership.
Effective military cooperation requires personal ties that take years to build, and, aside from some joint naval and air exercises, the two countries have little experience working together.
Boosting technical interoperability also will take considerable time, though both countries maintain sophisticated defense forces with great potential to be linked together.
Effective cooperation will also require a broader scope for joint action – an imperative that is not reflected in the recent intelligence-sharing agreement.
The risks to stability in Northeast Asia extend well beyond North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, and a joint intelligence agenda should address them.
How will the allies respond to the threat of a conventional military attack by – or instability in – North Korea?
What if the North Korean regime collapses, and China does intervene militarily?
After spending the last six decades defending South Korea and Japan, the US has every reason – and plenty of leverage – to demand that its two long-time allies enhance their military cooperation.
Simply focusing on the positive – America’s classic approach to alliance diplomacy – is no longer enough.
Whatever their historical disagreements, South Korea and Japan both face serious risks in their immediate neighborhood.
It is up to the US to ensure that they work together to protect themselves – and ensure long-term stability throughout Asia.

The Europe Question in 2016
NEW YORK – At the cusp of the new year, we face a world in which geopolitical and geo-economic risks are multiplying.
Most of the Middle East is ablaze, stoking speculation that a long Sunni-Shia war (like Europe’s Thirty Years’ War between Catholics and Protestants) could be at hand.
China’s rise is fueling a wide range of territorial disputes in Asia and challenging America’s strategic leadership in the region.
And Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has apparently become a semi-frozen conflict, but one that could reignite at any time.
There is also the chance of another epidemic, as outbreaks of SARS, MERS, Ebola, and other infectious diseases have shown in recent years.
Cyber-warfare is a looming threat as well, and non-state actors and groups are creating conflict and chaos from the Middle East to North and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Last, but certainly not least, climate change is already causing significant damage, with extreme weather events becoming more frequent and lethal.
Yet it is Europe that may turn out to be the ground zero of geopolitics in 2016.
For starters, a Greek exit from the eurozone may have been only postponed, not prevented, as pension and other structural reforms put the country on a collision course with its European creditors.
“Grexit,” in turn, could be the beginning of the end of the monetary union, as investors would wonder which member – possibly even a core country (for example, Finland) – will be the next to leave.
If Grexit does occur, the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU may become more likely.
Compared to a year ago, the probability of “Brexit” has increased, for several reasons. The recent terrorist attacks in Europe have made the UK even more isolationist, as has the migration crisis.
Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Labour is more Euroskeptic.
And Prime Minister David Cameron has painted himself into a corner by demanding EU reforms that even the Germans – who are sympathetic to the UK – cannot accept.
To many in Britain, the EU looks like a sinking ship.
If Brexit were to occur, other dominos would fall.
Scotland might decide to leave the UK, leading to the breakup of Britain.
This could inspire other separatist movements – perhaps starting in Catalonia – to push even more forcefully for independence.
And the EU’s Nordic members may decide that with the UK gone, they, too, would be better off leaving.
As for terrorism, the sheer number of homegrown jihadists means that the question for Europe is not whether another attack will occur, but when and where.
And repeated attacks could sharply reduce business and consumer confidence and stall Europe’s fragile economic recovery.
Those who argue that the migration crisis also poses an existential threat to Europe are right.
But the issue is not the million newcomers entering Europe in 2015. It is the 20 million more who are displaced, desperate, and seeking to escape violence, civil war, state failure, desertification, and economic collapse in large parts of the Middle East and Africa.
If Europe is unable to find a coordinated solution to this problem and enforce a common external border, the Schengen Agreement will collapse and internal borders between the EU member states will reappear.
Meanwhile, austerity and reform fatigue on the eurozone periphery – and among non-eurozone EU members such as Hungary and Poland – is clashing with bailout fatigue in the core.
Populist parties of the left and right – with their shared hostility to free trade, migration, Muslims, and globalization – are becoming more popular throughout Europe.
Syriza is in power in Greece; a leftist coalition is in office in Portugal; and the Spanish election could lead to significant political and policy uncertainty.
Virulent anti-migrant, anti-Muslim parties are becoming more popular in Europe’s core, including the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden.
In France, the far-right National Front came close to winning power in several regions earlier this month, and its leader, Marine Le Pen, may do well in the 2017 presidential election.
In Italy, moreover, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is under attack by two anti-euro populist parties that have risen in opinion polls.
And Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leadership is now under threat in Germany, following her courageous but controversial decision to allow almost a million asylum-seekers to enter the country.
In short, the distance between what Europe needs and what Europeans want is growing, and that gap could spell deep trouble in 2016.
The eurozone and the EU are facing multiple threats, all of which call for a collective response.
But what we are seeing is its member states increasingly adopting a national approach, thus undermining the possibility of Europe-wide solutions (the migration crisis is a tragic case in point).
Europe needs more cooperation, integration, risk sharing, and solidarity.
Instead, Europeans appear to be embracing nationalism, balkanization, divergence, and disintegration.

Will the Economic Strategy Work?
PARIS – With the COVID-19 crisis bringing France to a halt, Insee, the French statistical institute, puts the drop in economic activity relative to normal at 35%. It reckons that the fall in household consumption is of a similar magnitude.
These numbers imply that each additional month of lockdown reduces annual GDP by three percentage points.
And sectoral situations are obviously worse: business output is down 40%, manufacturing output down 50%, and some services sectors have come to a complete standstill.
Ex ante estimates for Germany and the United Kingdom are similar, and, if anything, corresponding numbers may be larger in economies with a smaller public sector.
Because even thriving companies can be killed in a matter of weeks by a shock of this magnitude, governments have reacted in a remarkably similar fashion.
To prevent bankruptcies, they are extending liquidity lifelines to private businesses in the form of massive credit guarantees and the deferral of tax payments (many of which will never be collected).
Germany, for example is rolling out €400 billion in public guarantees to make sure that its banks will roll over outstanding loans to businesses.
Overall, eurozone fiscal liquidity schemes for business and employees amount to 13% of GDP.
European countries are, moreover, making extensive use of mechanisms that temporarily transfer to the government the largest part of the wage bill of companies forced to stop or cut production.
Workers retain their employment contract and, one way or another, most of their wage, but the company receives state support that covers nearly all the costs.
Unlike layoffs, which sever ties between a company and its workforce, such schemes make it possible to keep workers financially afloat until the company reopens for business.
Such arrangements, where they already existed, were generally used to address sector-specific crises. Now, they have been massively extended.
Absent an extensive social insurance system to build on, the US stimulus package, adopted on March 26, has similar aims, but a different structure.
The federal government will send checks to low- and middle-income taxpayers, extend grants to small businesses, conditional on them keeping their workers, increase the duration of unemployment insurance and broaden eligibility, and pay $600 per week to laid-off and furloughed workers. This is, in spirit, a very European package.
But stark differences remain: from March 14 to March 21, weekly unemployment claims in the US soared by an unprecedented amount – from 282,000 to 3.28 million. No European country has experienced such an abrupt business response to the shock.
Whether the strategy will be effective is hard to assess.
Whatever the size of the shield that is being extended to protect businesses and workers, devastation is certain.
Many companies were caught off guard by the crisis, loaded with debt and now devoid of prospects. Liquidity helps them but it won’t save them from the threat of insolvency.
The collapsing stock markets have reduced the value of collateral, leaving borrowers more fragile and putting leveraged investors in great danger.
Banks are piling up bad debt once again.
Moreover, many gig workers, temporary employees, and new entrants on the labor market have been left without an income, while the bureaucratic plumbing of the new unemployment insurance schemes is an operational nightmare.
So there will be many, many casualties. But overall, the approach being taken is probably the best possible.
Is it a sustainable strategy?
It is easy to do the fiscal numbers.
Assuming that the business sector accounts for 80% of the economy, that its output is down by 40%, and that government action aims at covering 80% of the corresponding income loss, budgetary support should amount to 0.8x0.4x0.8=25% of pre-crisis output, or a bit more than 2% of annual GDP per month.
Three months of complete or partial lockdown, followed by only a gradual recovery, could add some ten percentage points of GDP to the budget deficit.
That is a very big number, but in current conditions, governments can afford to go deeply into debt.
Interest rates were at historically low levels before the crisis hit, for reasons that were mostly structural and will therefore remain valid.
Moreover, central banks everywhere are backstopping their governments and will avoid self-fulfilling debt crises.
In these conditions, large deficits can be tolerated, at least in the short run.
The economic sustainability of the strategy is more in question.
It is worth keeping a business on life support for a few weeks, because to let it go bust would be a loss not only to its shareholders and workers, but to society at large.
Firm-specific skills, know-how, and intangible capital would be lost for good. So governments have been right not to hesitate.
But will that still be true after six months?
Or nine?
A firm that has remained idle for too long is likely to become riddled with debt, and it may have lost its economic value.
It must be admitted that the conservation strategy is predicated on a relatively short crisis.
It is right for the time being, but it may have to be adapted in the light of events.
The hardest issue may be how to manage the exit from the lockdown after the public-health threat has been contained and economic policy takes center stage again.
Some have started speaking of a stimulus plan, but supply may well remain constrained for some months, while pent-up household demand for goods and services could be considerable.
As after a war, shortages are likely to arise, in some sectors at least. And it is very hard to predict whether aggregate demand will be excessive (owing to accumulated savings and repressed consumption) or depressed (because of fear, financial losses, debt, and the collapse of international trade).

How Scary Is the Bond Market?
NEW HAVEN – The prices of long-term government bonds have been running very high in recent years (that is, their yields have been very low).
In the United States, the 30-year Treasury bond yield reached a record low (since the Federal Reserve series began in 1972) of 2.25% on January 30. The yield on the United Kingdom's 30-year government bond fell to 2.04% on the same day.
The Japanese 20-year government bond yielded just 0.87% on January 20.
All of these yields have since moved slightly higher, but they remain exceptionally low.
It seems puzzling – and unsustainable – that people would tie up their money for 20 or 30 years to earn little or nothing more than these central banks' 2% target rate for annual inflation.
So, with the bond market appearing ripe for a dramatic correction, many are wondering whether a crash could drag down markets for other long-term assets, such as housing and equities.
It is a question that I am repeatedly asked at seminars and conferences.
After all, participants in the housing and equity markets set prices with a view to prices in the bond market, so contagion from one long-term market to another seems like a real possibility.
I have been thinking about the bond market for a long time.
In fact, the long-term bond market was the subject of my 1972 PhD dissertation and my first-ever academic publication the following year, co-authored with my academic adviser, Franco Modigliani.
Our work with data for the years 1952-1971 showed that the long-term bond market back then was pretty easy to describe.
Long-term interest rates on any given date could be explained quite well as a certain weighted average of the last 18 quarters of inflation and the last 18 quarters of short-term real interest rates.
When either inflation or short-term real interest rates went up, long-term rates rose.
When either fell, so did long-term rates.
We now have more than 40 years of additional data, so I took a look to see if our theory still predicts well.
It turns out that our estimates then, if applied to subsequent data, predicted long-term rates extremely well for the 20 years after we published; but then, in the mid-1990s, our theory started to overpredict.
According to our model, long-term rates in the US should be even lower than they are now, because both inflation and short-term real interest rates are practically zero or negative.
Even taking into account the impact of quantitative easing since 2008, long-term rates are higher than expected.
But the explanation that we developed so long ago still fits well enough to encourage the belief that we will not see a crash in the bond market unless central banks tighten monetary policy very sharply (by hiking short-term interest rates) or there is a major spike in inflation.
Bond-market crashes have actually been relatively rare and mild.
In the US, the biggest one-year drop in the Global Financial Data extension of Moody's monthly total return index for 30-year corporate bonds (going back to 1857) was 12.5% in the 12 months ending in February 1980.
Compare that to the stock market: According to the GFD monthly S&P 500 total return index, an annual loss of 67.8% occurred in the year ending in May 1932, during the Great Depression, and one-year losses have exceeded 12.5% in 23 separate episodes since 1900.
It is also worth noting what kind of event is needed to produce a 12.5% crash in the long-term bond market.
The one-year drop in February 1980 came immediately after Paul Volcker took the helm of the Federal Reserve in 1979.
A 1979 Gallup Poll had shown that 62% of Americans regarded inflation as the “most important problem facing the nation."
Volcker took radical steps to deal with it, hiking short-term interest rates so high that he created a major recession.
He also created enemies (and even faced death threats).
People wondered whether he would get away with it politically, or be impeached.
Regarding the stock market and the housing market, there may well be a major downward correction someday.
But it probably will have little to do with a bond-market crash.
That was the case with the biggest US stock-market corrections of the last century (after 1907, 1929, 1973, 2000, and 2007) and the biggest US housing-market corrections of all time (after 1979, 1989, and 2006).
It is true that extraordinarily low long-term bond yields put us outside the range of historical experience.
But so would a scenario in which a sudden bond-market crash drags down prices of stocks and housing.
When an event has never occurred, it cannot be predicted with any semblance of confidence.

Getting African Women into the Boardroom
EBENE, MAURITIUS – By 2050, one-quarter of the world’s population will be African, which means that one in eight people will be an African woman.
Yet, within the continent, let alone internationally, Africa’s women lack the economic clout their numbers might suggest.
That disconnect has severe adverse implications for Africa’s prospects.
In fact, the only way to tap Africa’s full potential is by dramatically improving women’s representation in the workplace, including in senior executive roles.
The contribution women can make to Africa’s future should be obvious.
Worldwide, consumer spending – which is growing three times faster in emerging markets than in developed economies – is largely controlled by women.
This implies a powerful incentive for companies to bring more women into their decision-making processes.
Yet, even as the number of women sitting on the boards of global companies rises, progress is slow, and African women have been largely left out – with notable exceptions, such as Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister and World Bank managing director, who was appointed to the board of Twitter last year, undoubtedly because of the platform’s growing popularity in Africa.
But Okonjo-Iweala is an outlier – few African women hold similarly influential positions at global corporations.
African women are barely present even in boardrooms within Africa, where 95% of CEOs are men.
According to data from the African Development Bank, women hold only 12.7% of the board seats in Africa’s top listed companies.
This reflects a broader lack of gender equality across the African private sector that is preventing the continent’s economies from reaching their full potential.
New research from the International Monetary Fund shows that countries ranked in the bottom 50% for gender equality globally – including large African economies like Ethiopia, Morocco, and Nigeria – could add a whopping 35% to their economies, on average, by bringing more women into the workplace.
Having more women in senior leadership roles is critical to catalyzing a shift, given the powerful role that diversity at the top plays in shaping organizational priorities.
As Africa is already home to six of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, achieving gender balance in the workplace could deliver a significant boost to global growth.
This growth “bonus” reflects more than just an expanded labor force; a large body of research shows that companies benefit substantially when they include more women, with their unique talents, skills, and perspectives.
For example, research by the McKinsey Global Institute reveals that businesses achieve higher financial returns when led by boards with greater ethnic and gender diversity.
Likewise, according to MSCI, a leading provider of investment-decision support tools, companies lacking in board diversity have an above-average likelihood of enduring governance-related controversies.
Companies with a critical mass of women in senior leadership positions, meanwhile, tend to perform better on corporate social responsibility.
Ghana’s worst-ever banking crisis, which erupted in 2017, was the result of years of weak risk management and poor corporate governance.
It is probably no coincidence that UT Bank and Capital Bank, the institutions that ultimately collapsed, lacked diversity in both their executive and non-executive leadership teams.
Different backgrounds and cognitive styles are critical in order to avoid homogenous groupthink and manage risk effectively.
Companies that rank poorly in terms of gender equality often claim that there are simply too few woman candidates available who are qualified for non-executive-board leadership.
But there are qualified women everywhere, and, thanks to rising female participation in higher education, their numbers are growing.
In fact, women are more likely than men to complete their degrees; but, as they climb the career ladder, they disappear from the ranks.
Corporate gender strategies must, therefore, address the dynamics that inhibit women’s career progression, from support networks to family leave and childcare, as well as policies addressing harassment in the workplace.
To find the female leaders they need, firms should also check their blind spots, including the biases, conscious and unconscious, that may be impeding the advancement of their female employees.
Women should also be encouraged to join networks and work with organizations that focus on finding and cultivating strong female leadership in order to enhance their visibility for new opportunities and increase their influence in existing roles.
The rapid gains in female representation in African governments underscore the availability of highly qualified and capable women.
In Rwanda, women hold over 60% of parliamentary seats, the largest share in the world.
Senegal also ranks in the top ten countries worldwide in this regard.
And in Ethiopia, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s cabinet is 50% female, and he has appointed Sahle-Work Zewde, the former United Nations representative to the African Union, as Ethiopia’s first female president.
According to the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law report, in the last decade, Sub-Saharan Africa has implemented more reforms aimed at boosting women’s economic inclusion than any other world region, but these numbers are largely propelled by a handful of economies on the continent.
It is time that these advances be reflected in more countries, as well as in the region’s private sector.
As African women make greater strides in getting their voices heard, governments and businesses within the region and around the world should embrace this trend and bring more of them into their executive teams and their boardrooms.
Given Africa’s swelling population and growing international influence, the effects of such a shift will be profoundly positive.

The Political Stock Market
Many economic and financial analysts complain that emerging countries' stock markets are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.
The unstated assumption seems to be that, in contrast, some pristine force of economic nature drives stock markets in advanced countries, and that forecasting their performance is thus like forecasting the growth of trees.
This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.
Indeed, the best analysts know that forecasting the performance of any country's stock market substantially means forecasting how well the government wants stock market investors to fare in the current political environment.
Consider the United States stock market, by far the world's largest.
The general perception is that the government leaves companies alone and that the returns from investing in the US stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy.
This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world.
But the returns that make US stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance. In particular, tax rates that affect stocks have varied through time as political pressures change.
During World War II, for example, political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends, and high incomes in general.
When World War II produced a strong recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, President Roosevelt and Congress slapped on an excess-profits tax to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the stock market was low, US voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man many thought too right wing to be president.
He asked for - and got - cuts in capital gains, dividend, and income taxes.
Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.
Property taxes, excise taxes, import duties, and sales taxes - all of which are paid, directly or indirectly, by corporations - can have a magnified impact on corporate profits, and hence on the stock market.
It is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive, governments take care that these taxes stop well short of destroying after-tax corporate profits.
Indeed, the politics of stock markets does not stop with taxes. On the contrary, almost every activity of government has an impact on corporate profits, and in turn, on the stock market.
After the 1929 stock market crash the US government suspended much anti-trust activity, allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value.
This policy delayed the recovery from high unemployment, but even that was not enough to rein in the political forces arrayed in favor of supporting the stock market.
Similarly, one of the most important things that President Reagan did was to destroy much of the remaining power of America's labor unions, which compete for their share of the corporate pie.
Reagan's defeat of the Air Traffic Controllers' strike in 1981 was a watershed event for the US labor movement - and for the stock market, which started its dramatic bull market in 1982.
The US government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the peak of the equities price bubble in 2000, most notably cutting interest rates repeatedly.
Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not supporting the stock market. But it is a telling sign of the US stock market's significance that one of the most important factors perceived to be weighing on the economy was declining equity prices.
Indeed, the authorities' response was not limited to monetary stimulus.
The US National Income and Product Accounts show that the effective rate of corporate profits tax (the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in taxes) crested at 33.7% in the first quarter of 2000 - the peak of the stock market and the economy in general - and fell to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was down.
Much of that decline reflects explicit tax relief measures voted by Congress, as well as the perception among corporations that in the current economic and political environment they can be more aggressive in tax avoidance.
Moreover, after the stock market crash, the maximum tax on dividends paid on stocks was slashed from 35% to 15%, giving a substantial new advantage to long-term investors and boosting the compounding effect of reinvesting after-tax dividends.
Again, this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy, which can, of course, be said of practically any measure aimed at supporting the stock market. But it is the balance of political forces that determines whether such a justification will be credible.
One might say that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement, have operated in the US for the past 200 years - and can thus be expected to continue operating in the future, producing high stock market returns and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment.
Those who believe that investments in the US stock market will maintain the same strong growth trend for decades may well be right.
But one should be clear about what one is forecasting.
Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance.

Holland After van Gogh
The murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh and the ensuing arson attacks against mosques, churches, and Islamic schools have caused more soul-searching in Dutch homes in the last week than in the past two decades.
The old Netherlands, it seems, has ceased to be, never to return.
The goal now must be to unite the Dutch people. This will require much work on the part of both immigrants and native Dutch.
As long as moderates keep their heads, a new Netherlands may be born out of the terrible events of the past weeks.
It is often said of the various immigrant groups in the Netherlands that they lack the ability to "cleanse themselves" through honest self-appraisal and criticism.
There are many who acknowledge this and want to change.
Non-committal multiculturalism has long kept the conservatism of Dutch Moroccans and Dutch Turks hidden from the public eye.
Among immigrants, soul-searching is closely related to belonging and commitment, which in practice boils down to feeling part of society and feeling responsible for the city, neighborhood, and street where you live.
We native Dutch also find it hard to hold a mirror to ourselves.
We are bad listeners and air our views whether or not we have thought deeply about them.
There is a lack of self-examination.
As a result, many people no longer understand themselves, which makes it hard for them to understand others.
Freedom of expression is becoming a caricature.
When asked what it was like to be interviewed by Theo van Gogh, European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said, "He was impertinent, and that is a good thing; he was offensive, and that is not."
It is as simple as that.
In today's Netherlands, assertiveness is seen as a good thing, modesty as a form of self-chastisement.
Respect is for wimps!
Moral relativism has damaged public life.
Many youngsters now see politics as a kind of computer game.
It is no longer about message or content - it is just one more form of entertainment, and what matters is who wins and who loses.
Context has been lost.
Extreme ideas offer an alternative compass to disoriented souls like Mohammed Bouyeri, van Gogh's suspected murderer.
He is not so much a product of zealous imams from rural Morocco as of the West's information society.
The gospel of Muslim extremism has found a global market through the Internet.
Something similar is happening on the extreme right, with "white power" offering an apparent certainty to youngsters who are adrift.
The real struggle is about ideas.
Indeed, what is most ominous is that extremists realize this more clearly than the moderate, silent majority, who find the noise irritating but do not know how to start a serious dialogue.
Meanwhile, tolerance degenerates into multicultural segregation.
We do not live together, but in isolation from each other.
The Turkish-Dutch headmaster of the Muslim school in Uden that was burned down after van Gogh's murder voiced the inhibitions we all feel when he asked, rhetorically, "Is the enemy not within us?"
A revived permissive society is not the answer.
The state must battle terrorism, public space must not be abandoned to extremists, and Islam in Europe must adapt to Europe.
People who live in a society they hate, amidst people they despise, cannot contribute to a shared future.
Life in Europe will only remain worth living if all cultures and religions accept the laws that represent the common interest.
So a European Islam is needed urgently.
It can be given shape by, for example, training imams in Europe, by encouraging mosques to promote social cohesion in their neighborhoods, and by more active participation by Muslims in the public debate.
At the same time, native Europeans must learn to accept that Islam may offer new vantage points on such moral issues as euthanasia, abortion, individuality, and solidarity.
This way Islam could really become a source of inspiration for the European community of values.
If we want to build something better on the ruins of multicultural indifference, our dialogue must become more profound.
Prejudice must make way for empathy, and alienation for respect.
Essentially, this is all about giving a new meaning to solidarity, beyond the left-right dichotomy.
It is time for a civilizing mission that will emerge from society itself and bring people together.
This mission must also reflect a new politics that does not accentuate differences, but helps shape a new sense of who "we" are.
The Netherlands need not be the focus of international religious conflict. What is precious must be preserved, and what enriches must be absorbed.
This process must begin in school.
Children must learn that they do not live in a monoculture, but in a pluralist society bound together by universal values and common laws.
They must learn that critical thought is valuable, and that doubt is healthy.
Restoring the past is not an option.
Rudderless societies are easy prey for bigotry.
This is not just a matter for politicians.
All of us must help turn Europe's motto "unity in diversity" into a genuine guiding principle.

GDP Should Be Corrected, Not Replaced
ZURICH – Respected economists have long pointed out that gross domestic product is an inadequate measure of economic development and social well-being, and thus should not be policymakers’ sole fixation.
Yet we have not gotten any closer to finding a feasible alternative to GDP.
One well-known shortcoming of GDP is that it disregards the value of housework, including care for children and elderly family members.
More important, assigning a monetary value to such activities would not address a deeper flaw in GDP: its inability to reflect adequately the lived experience of individual members of society.
Correcting for housework would inflate GDP, while making no real difference to living standards.
And the women who make up a predominant share of people performing housework would continue to be treated as volunteers, rather than as genuine economic contributors.
Another well-known flaw of GDP is that it does not account for value destruction, such as when countries mismanage their human capital by withholding education from certain demographic groups, or by depleting natural resources for immediate economic benefit.
All told, GDP tends to measure assets imprecisely, and liabilities not at all.
Still, while no international consensus on an alternative to GDP has emerged, there has been encouraging progress toward a more considered way of thinking about economic activity.
In 1972, Yale University economists William Nordhaus and James Tobin proposed a new framework, the “measure of economic welfare” (MEW), to account for sundry unpaid activities.
And, more recently, China established a “green development” index, which considers economic performance alongside various environmental factors.
Moreover, public- and private-sector decision-makers now have far more tools for making sophisticated choices than they did in the past.
On the investor side, demand for environmental, social, and governance data is rising steeply.
And in the public sector, organizations such as the World Bank have adopted metrics other than GDP to assess quality of life, including life expectancy at birth and access to education.
At the same time, the debate around gross national income has been gaining steam.
Though it shares fundamental elements with GDP, GNI is more relevant to our globalized age, because it adjusts for income generated by foreign-owned corporations and foreign residents.
Accordingly, in a country where foreign corporations own a significant share of manufacturing and other assets, GDP will be inflated, whereas GNI shows only income the country actually retains (see chart).
Ireland is a prominent example of how GNI has been used to correct for distortions in GDP.
In 2015, Ireland’s reported GDP increased by an eye-popping 26.3%.
As an October 2016 OECD working paper noted, the episode raised serious questions about the “ability of the conceptual accounting framework used to define GDP to adequately reflect economic reality.”
The OECD paper went on to conclude that GDP is not a reliable indicator of a country’s material well-being.
In Ireland’s case, its single year of astonishing GDP growth was due to multinational corporations “relocating” certain economic gains – namely, the returns on intellectual property – in their overall accounting.
To address the growing disparity between actual economic development and reported GDP, the Irish Central Statistics Office introduced a modified version of GNI known as GNI*) for 2016.
The gap between GDP and GNI will likely close soon in other jurisdictions, too.
In a recent working paper, Urooj Khan of Columbia Business School, Suresh Nallareddy of Duke University, and Ethan Rouen of Harvard Business School highlight a misalignment in “the growth in corporate profits and the overall US economy” between 1975 and 2013.
They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.
In late December, this disconnect was addressed with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
By lowering the corporate-tax rate to a globally competitive level and granting better terms for repatriating profits, the tax package is expected to shift corporate earnings back to the United States.
As a result, the divergence between GDP and GNI will likely close in both the US and Ireland, where many major US corporations have been holding cash.
Looking ahead, I would suggest that policymakers focus on three points.
First, as demonstrated above, the relevant stakeholders are already addressing several of the flaws in GDP, which is encouraging.
Second, public- and private-sector decision-makers now have a multitude of instruments available for better assessing the social and environmental ramifications of their actions.
And, third, in business one must not let the perfect become the enemy of the good.
We have not solved all of the problems associated with GDP, but we have come a long way in reducing many of its distortions.
Instead of seeking a new, disruptive framework to replace current data and analytical techniques, we should focus on making thoughtful, incremental changes to the existing system.

Is Inequality Inhibiting Growth?
CHICAGO – To understand how to achieve a sustained recovery from the Great Recession, we need to understand its causes.
And identifying causes means starting with the evidence.
Two facts stand out.
First, overall demand for goods and services is much weaker, both in Europe and the United States, than it was in the go-go years before the recession.
Second, most of the economic gains in the US in recent years have gone to the rich, while the middle class has fallen behind in relative terms.
In Europe, concerns about domestic income inequality, though more muted, are compounded by angst about inequality between countries, as Germany roars ahead while the southern periphery stalls.
Persuasive explanations of the crisis point to linkages between today’s tepid demand and rising income inequality.
Progressive economists argue that the weakening of unions in the US, together with tax policies favoring the rich, slowed middle-class income growth, while traditional transfer programs were cut back.
With incomes stagnant, households were encouraged to borrow, especially against home equity, to maintain consumption.
Rising house prices gave people the illusion that increasing wealth backed their borrowing.
But, now that house prices have collapsed and credit is unavailable to underwater households, demand has plummeted.
The key to recovery, then, is to tax the rich, increase transfers, and restore worker incomes by enhancing union bargaining power and raising minimum wages.
This emphasis on anti-worker, pro-rich policies as the recession’s primary cause fits less well with events in Europe.
Countries like Germany that reformed labor laws to create more flexibility for employers, and did not raise wages rapidly, seem to be in better economic shape than countries like France and Spain, where labor was better protected.
So consider an alternative explanation: Starting in the early 1970’s, advanced economies found it increasingly difficult to grow.
Countries like the US and the United Kingdom eventually responded by deregulating their economies.
Greater competition and the adoption of new technologies increased the demand for, and incomes of, highly skilled, talented, and educated workers doing non-routine jobs like consulting.
More routine, once well-paying, jobs done by the unskilled or the moderately educated were automated or outsourced.
So income inequality emerged, not primarily because of policies favoring the rich, but because the liberalized economy favored those equipped to take advantage of it.
The short-sighted political response to the anxieties of those falling behind was to ease their access to credit.
Faced with little regulatory restraint, banks overdosed on risky loans.
Thus, while differing on the root causes of inequality (at least in the US), the progressive and alternative narratives agree about its consequences.
The alternative narrative has more to say.
Continental Europe did not deregulate as much, and preferred to seek growth in greater economic integration.
But the price for protecting workers and firms was slower growth and higher unemployment.
And, while inequality did not increase as much as in the US, job prospects were terrible for the young and unemployed, who were left out of the protected system.
The advent of the euro was a seeming boon, because it reduced borrowing costs and allowed countries to create jobs through debt-financed spending.
The crisis ended that spending, whether by national governments (Greece), local governments (Spain), the construction sector (Ireland and Spain), or the financial sector (Ireland).
Unfortunately, past spending pushed up wages, without a commensurate increase in productivity, leaving the heavy spenders indebted and uncompetitive.
The important exception to this pattern is Germany, which was accustomed to low borrowing costs even before it entered the eurozone.
Germany had to contend with historically high unemployment, stemming from reunification with a sick East Germany.
In the euro’s initial years, Germany had no option but to reduce worker protections, limit wage increases, and reduce pensions as it tried to increase employment.
Germany’s labor costs fell relative to the rest of the eurozone, and its exports and GDP growth exploded.
The alternative view suggests different remedies.
The US should focus on helping to tailor the education and skills of the people being left behind to the available jobs.
This will not be easy or quick, but it beats having corrosively high levels of inequality of opportunity, as well as a large segment of the population dependent on transfers.
Rather than paying for any necessary spending by raising tax rates on the rich sky high, which would hurt entrepreneurship, more thoughtful across-the-board tax reform is needed.
For the uncompetitive parts of the eurozone, structural reforms can no longer be postponed.
But, given the large adjustment needs, it is not politically feasible to do everything, including painful fiscal tightening, immediately.
Less austerity, while not a sustainable growth strategy, may ease the pain of adjustment.
That, in a nutshell, is the fundamental eurozone dilemma: the periphery needs financing as it adjusts, while Germany, pointing to the post-euro experience, says that it cannot trust countries to reform once they get the money.
The Germans have been insisting on institutional change – more centralized eurozone control over periphery banks and government budgets in exchange for expanded access to financing for the periphery.
Yet institutional change, despite the euphoria that greeted the latest EU summit, will take time, for it requires careful structuring and broader public support.
Europe may be better off with stop-gap measures.
If confidence in Italy or Spain deteriorates again, the eurozone may have to resort to the traditional bridge between weak credibility and low-cost financing: a temporary International Monetary Fund-style monitored reform program.
Such programs cannot dispense with the need for government resolve, as Greece’s travails demonstrate.
And governments hate the implied loss of sovereignty and face.
But determined governments, like those of Brazil and India, have negotiated programs in the past that set them on the path to sustained growth.
As a reformed Europe starts growing, parts of it may experience US-style inequality.
But growth can provide the resources to address that.
Far worse for Europe would be to avoid serious reform and lapse into egalitarian and genteel decline.
Japan, not the US, is the example to avoid.

Experts and Inequality
NEW YORK – Ten years ago this month, the world glimpsed the first clear signals of an economic crisis that, a year later, would be in full swing, creating economic hardship of a kind not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The deep recession that followed the near-collapse of the global financial system in 2008 caught nearly everyone by surprise – including the experts who were presumably the best equipped to see it coming.
In November 2008, less than two months after the failure of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, a visibly irate Queen Elizabeth II, visiting the London School of Economics, famously asked, “Why did nobody notice it?”
Over the last decade, a range of answers has been offered, with experts being blamed for arrogance, complicity, or being just plain overrated.
And the context was dire, with jobs lost and balance sheets shrinking.
The queen’s own personal wealth had fallen by £25 million ($32.1 million) since the start of the crisis (though the decline was from a very high base.)
Now, with the perspective offered by the post-crisis decade, we may be in a better position to answer Queen Elizabeth’s question.
But we must first consider more broadly the challenges confronting economists and financial experts in today’s world – challenges that remain poorly understood, by contemporary economics’ critics and defenders alike.
The first problem is that for certain types of economic phenomena – such as financial recessions, stock-market crashes, or exchange-rate fluctuations – it is logically impossible for anyone to be known to be forecasting accurately far in advance.
This does not mean that no one has the ability to foresee a crash, but rather that no one can be known for having that ability.
If someone does have such a reputation, their predictions can become self-fulfilling prophecies: if they predict, say, a stock-market crash, everybody will begin to sell their shares, bringing about the predicted outcome.
A second problem of expertise arises from the fact that it is not always in the interest of experts to reveal what they do and do not know.
Most people would prefer to show off their expertise, perhaps exaggerating how wide a field it covers.
Of course, this does not negate the value of experts.
For example, when I was an adviser to the Indian government, a decision was taken to sell some 3G spectrum.
Some of us argued that the government should use professionally designed auctions – an area where economists have expertise akin to engineers – instead of selling the asset for a pre-determined price.
India’s political leaders listened, and the spectrum, which had been valued by bureaucrats at $7 billion, sold for an astonishing $15 billion.
But there are many fields where economists’ knowledge is highly imprecise and comes with significant provisos, which may not be fully understood.
This may be because decision-makers choose not to pay attention; but it may also be because economists themselves do not spell out the risks.
This risk is all the more acute in a world where scientific and technological progress is taking us into uncharted territory.
The decisions that must be taken in response to these developments – those related to the nature of the world or those we have created ourselves – require as much accurate information as possible.
Increasing complexity is reflected in contemporary law and policy.
It is common nowadays for people to conclude contracts that are so long and convoluted that signatories do not know what they entail (this was a major factor contributing to the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, which fueled the global economic crisis and subsequent Great Recession).
Likewise, central banks nowadays intervene in ways that often are poorly understood by those most affected.
The upshot is that we are increasingly reliant on experts. And experts may decide to use their know-how not just to address the challenges ahead, but also to serve their own interests.
This is an age-old problem.
In the seventeenth century, the economist and investor Sir William Petty was tasked with surveying large swaths of army land, much of which lay fallow, in Ireland.
He did a good job, using some truly innovative methods. But he also ended up personally owning much of the land he had surveyed.
This “Petty problem” is likely to become worse, as the world’s complexity – and, thus, its reliance on expertise – increases. This will do nothing to endear experts to ordinary people.
Already, many parts of the world, from the US to India, are experiencing a surge in right-wing populist sentiment that is rooted at least partly in mistrust of experts, who are perceived as self-serving.
It is not immediately clear how the Petty problem can be solved. But we must acknowledge its existence – and recognize that it is intimately connected to high and rising inequality in much of the world.
Moreover, we must address inequality head on, by limiting the gap between the richest and poorest.
If, for example, it becomes impossible for a CEO to earn more than a certain multiple of what the average worker in his or her firm is paid, there will be a limit to how much ingenuity the CEO directs toward pure self-enrichment.
Of course, imposing caps on executive compensation is a blunt instrument for fighting inequality.
But more nuanced policymaking – often based on the misguided assumption that companies can be trusted, or induced, to self-regulate – has failed.
The time has come for measures that everyone can understand.

Listen to the Science
STOCKHOLM – The announcement of this year’s Nobel Prize laureates should remind us of the many contributions basic science has made to contemporary life.
With COVID-19 ravaging much of humanity, and the world anxiously awaiting a breakthrough that can end the pandemic, we can no longer take science for granted.
And the global science community, for its part, has risen to the occasion in unprecedented ways, not only to develop vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics, but also to improve our understanding of the virus and the best strategies to protect ourselves.
But the world is also afflicted by other crises that must not be ignored.
Last month was the warmest September ever recorded.
Tens of millions of people around the world are already experiencing the disastrous effects of human-induced climate change, from raging wildfires and rising sea levels to dangerous heat waves, droughts, and floods.
Given current and projected greenhouse-gas emissions, more extreme symptoms of this kind are inevitable, and the increase in the frequency and intensity of many could be irreversible.
There are also deepening social and economic crises.
The pandemic has battered national economies, exacerbated many forms of inequality, and sown distrust and social unrest around the world.
We rely ever more on technology to conduct our daily lives, educate our children, and connect with each other, but we have yet to do enough to prevent the same technology from being used to amplify dangerous misinformation, inflame social unrest, and leave vulnerable communities even further behind.
Just as scientists and researchers have come together in unprecedented ways to fight the pandemic, so must we mobilize our best and brightest minds to tackle these other global emergencies.
Like COVID-19, none can be stopped anywhere until it is stopped everywhere.
Drawing lessons from the global pandemic response and recovery efforts, our organizations will host a virtual Nobel Prize Summit next spring, with the theme “Our Planet, Our Future.”
The event will bring together Nobel laureates, leading thinkers, policymakers, business innovators, and youth leaders to discuss how progress can be made against climate change, inequality, and the potential harms of powerful new technologies.
The ultimate goal will be to build a more resilient, sustainable future for everyone.
In our Anthropocene epoch, we acknowledge that humankind has become the single most important force acting on the planet.
We also should recognize that our own encroachments on nature are the common denominator underlying today’s global crises.
There is a growing body of evidence to show that not only climate change, but also disease outbreaks, are linked to human development and biodiversity loss.
As natural buffers between humans and disease-carrying animals erode, pandemics as bad as the current one could become even more likely.
Because we live in such an interconnected world, what starts as a local public-health emergency can rapidly evolve into a global economic crisis with far-reaching social repercussions.
The current crisis thus should be a transformative moment for humanity.
We are seeing firsthand just how much our individual futures depend on the collective health and safety of all people and of our natural world.
Though science cannot provide all the answers, it clearly is the most important tool we have, not only for stopping the pandemic, but also for building resilience into our infrastructure and economy.
The COVID-19 pandemic also has offered many lessons that will be useful in preparing for a future marked by climate change, biodiversity loss, technological disruption, and inequality.
For example, as we saw in many places, nature quickly “bounced back” during the early stages of the pandemic, owing to society-wide lockdowns.
We also saw that the virus and its broader ramifications disproportionately burdened the most vulnerable citizens, including racial minorities and the poor.
We now must consider what these unequal effects tell us about our current infrastructure and social arrangements.
How might institutions be reimagined to ensure greater equity for all?
We have also learned that public trust in science is crucial, as is a basic understanding of risk and uncertainty.
Without public buy-in, there will be little chance of effective political management of future crises.
Misinformation, widely disseminated with the help of today’s information and communication technologies, has created an “infodemic” within the pandemic, reducing public trust in science and making it far more difficult for public-health officials to contain the virus.
How can we combat false or misleading narratives and communicate scientific findings more effectively with policymakers and the public?
Although our celebrations of this year’s Nobel laureates will be held virtually, they will be no less enthusiastic than in the past.
And, despite the infodemic, most people’s appreciation of science has grown during this crisis.
Scientists have come together like never before to help stop COVID-19.
To overcome the pandemic and meet the other global challenges we face, we must follow their example – and their lead.

The Cooperation Crisis
PARIS – The rise of emerging economies worldwide has generated much optimism, in terms not only of economic development, but also of global cooperation.
But the shift to a multipolar world order has not bolstered multilateralism.
In fact, the opposite is true: the logic of national sovereignty has staged a comeback, with major economies consistently undermining cooperation on issues ranging from security to trade to climate change.
Consider the muddle in the United Nations Security Council over Syria’s civil war.
Just two years ago, the Council approved a resolution authorizing a military intervention in Libya – the first resolution to implement the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) principle, which the general assembly adopted unanimously in 2005.
But the emerging powers soon came to believe that the West had used the protection of Libya’s civilian population as a pretext for regime change (though, realistically, it would have been impossible to protect the population without toppling Muammar el-Qaddafi’s government).
Now, these countries are largely rejecting R2P, viewing it as a device employed by Western governments to legitimize their attempts to infringe upon national sovereignty.
Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force – effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied.
For their part, Russia and China have blocked three resolutions condemning the Syrian regime, and Russia has worked hard – with evident success – to derail any military intervention in Syria.
In this sense, Russia and China now exercise de facto control over the formal international legality of the use of force.
To be sure, many countries ­now believe that the West is going too far in challenging state sovereignty, with even European countries like Germany recoiling at the prospect of military confrontation.
At the G-20 summit in early September, for example, US President Barack Obama struggled to convince ten states to sign a declaration on Syria that did not even mention the use of force.
Only the US, the United Kingdom, and France remain willing to use force if it is deemed necessary.
But viewing intervention in Syria within the paradigm of Western messianism is a mistake.
After all, in Syria, as in Libya, the forces challenging the government are not a creature of Western manipulation.
They are indigenous – and they are asking the West for help.
The legal basis for military intervention may be weak, but Syria is no Iraq, either.
Security is not the only area where sovereignty concerns have superseded multilateralism.
In 2008, the US abandoned its commitment to the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round of global trade negotiations.
While the decision followed a technical disagreement with India, it was driven largely by the belief that any agreement would benefit China more than the US.
Given that the Doha Round has failed to address the main problems that the US and Europe have encountered in trade relations with China – non-compliance with intellectual-property rules, subsidies for state-owned enterprises, closed government-procurement markets, and limits on access to the services market – both are now emphasizing bilateral trade agreements.
But, while the world may be happy to pretend that bilateral cooperation will revitalize multilateralism, nobody should be fooled.
The WTO will survive, but its centrality in the trade system is rapidly diminishing.
Even cooperation on climate change is crumbling, with the US and China rejecting the multilateral, top-down approach to policymaking.
This implies the end of the Kyoto Protocol model, which, like the Doha model, is based on a detailed agenda, established according to specific and ambitious targets, with all relevant actors then compelled to negotiate each topic.
Rather than being subject to an internationally agreed standard, the US and China want the fight against climate change to begin with countries’ individual commitments.
But this new, bottom-up framework, in which states determine the conditions for a multilateral agreement, lacks an authority to establish standards.
Multilateralism requires minimal consensus on global rules and norms among all major powers.
The greater the number of countries that have the power to block or veto international initiatives, the more difficult multilateralism becomes – and the less motivated dominant countries are to cooperate.
In the emerging multipolar world, characterized by sovereignty concerns and strategic competition, progress toward resolving global issues will be more difficult than ever – with potentially devastating consequences.

Europe’s Racist Schools
I am what many people call a “Gypsy.” I prefer the term “Roma.”
There are more than 10 million of us across Europe.
The vast majority of us live in Third World conditions – denied access to adequate housing, health care, and education.
I was born in a provincial town in Bulgaria in the late 1960’s, when, like the rest of Eastern Europe, the country was under Communist rule.
The Party recognized no ethnic minorities – we were all, formally, equal.
Indeed, we were so equal that the government gave many of us new, Bulgarian names.
One day, when I was a teenager named Husni, my name became Ivan.
But we were not equal.
Roma lived in segregated ghettos.
We were second-class citizens.
One of my clearest early childhood memories is of my father telling my younger sister and me, “Education is the key to success.”
He said, “If you want to be accepted as equals by Gadje [non-Roma], you must be better educated than they are.
This is not easy.
But if you succeed, this will change not only your life but also the lives of many of your people.”
Education is the only way out of the ghetto for many Roma.
But in societies like Bulgaria, where racism is rampant, Roma have to fight for equal schooling.
Most of the children I grew up with received an inferior education that did not train them for university or skilled jobs.
They are either unemployed or working as unskilled laborers in Bulgaria or in the black market abroad.
By contrast, in large part because of my father, I managed to complete high school, then medical school, and become a general practitioner.
By the early 1990’s, Bulgaria had changed.
The transition to democracy promised freedom and prosperity to all who had suffered in communism’s stranglehold.
Yet the Roma found themselves losers of the democratic transformation.
Their situation, always tenuous, dramatically worsened.
Their poor schooling left them ill equipped for the new economy.
The communist dogma was shattered, but so was the pretense that we were all equals in a homogenous society.
The government allowed employment discrimination to go unchecked, leaving the majority of Roma without jobs, and communities were plunged deeper into poverty.
I obtained a law degree to help advocate for members of my community.
Today, I live and work in Brussels, where I lead an organization that advises the European Union and national governments on Roma-related policies.
I support my family and have achieved fulfillment in my career.
But I am an exception.
It is because of the importance of education in making me an exception that I am so deeply troubled by a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights.
The case was brought by 18 Roma children from the city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who had been assigned to special remedial schools for the “mentally deficient.”
In Central and Eastern Europe, Roma are often unfairly placed in these special schools, which provide sub-par education that all but guarantees a life of poverty and manual labor.
I served as one of the lawyers for the children.
The evidence showed that more than half of the Roma children in Ostrava were placed in special schools, and that more than half of the population of special schools was Roma.
All told, Roma children in Ostrava are more than 27 times more likely than non-Roma to be placed in such schools.
This is not a unique situation.
Far from it.
The same disproportionate patterns of school assignment exist throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe.
As a United Nations expert body has declared, this is racial segregation, plain and simple.
But the Court was unmoved.
Its judgment recognized that the claimants raised “a number of serious arguments,” and that the education system in Ostrava perpetuated racial segregation.
But the Court ruled that, absent a showing of actual racial bias in the minds of testers and administrators – virtually impossible to prove – the pervasive reality of racial disadvantage was not unlawful.
In what could have been a landmark victory that would open the doors of opportunity for Europe’s Roma, the Strasbourg Court instead chose to keep Roma locked out of a decent education.
Its decision reverberates across the Continent – not just for the Roma, but for all who have a stake in promoting the values of tolerance and equality in a democratic Europe.
Anyone who believes in the rights of all children to quality education should be troubled by a decision so myopic.
For decades, racial segregation in European schools has stigmatized generations of Roma children as stupid and disabled.
The Court’s decision allows this brutal and systematic violation of fundamental rights to continue.
The Roma, and Europe, have suffered a great defeat.

Barack Obama and American Power
CAMBRIDGE – One of the first challenges that President Barack Obama will face is the effects of the ongoing financial crisis, which has called into question the future of American power.
An article in The Far Eastern Economic Review proclaims that “Wall Street’s crack-up presages a global tectonic shift: the beginning of the decline of American power.”
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev sees the crisis as a sign that America’s global leadership is coming to an end, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has declared that Beijing is now much more relevant than New York.
Yet the dollar, a symbol of American financial power, has surged rather than declined.
As Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist of the IMF notes, “It is ironic, given that we just messed up big-time, that the response of foreigners is to pour more money into us.
They’re not sure where else to go.
They seem to have more confidence in our ability to solve our problems than we do.”
It used to be said that when America sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold.
More recently, many claimed that with the rise of China and the petro-states, an American slowdown could be decoupled from the rest of the world.
But when the United States caught the financial flu, others followed.
Many foreign leaders quickly switched from schadenfreude to fear – and to the security of US treasury bills.
Crises often refute conventional wisdom, and this one reveals that the underlying strength of the American economy remains impressive.
The poor performance of Wall Street and America regulators has cost America a good deal in terms of the soft power of its economic model’s attractiveness, but the blow need not be fatal if, in contrast to Japan in the 1990’s, the US manages to absorb the losses and limit the damage.
The World Economic Forum still rates the American economy as the world’s most competitive, owing to its labor-market flexibility, higher education, political stability, and openness to innovation.
The larger question concerns the long-term future of American power.
A new forecast for 2025 being prepared by the US National Intelligence Council projects that American dominance will be “much diminished,” and that the one key area of continued American superiority – military power – will be less significant in the competitive world of the future.
This is not so much a question of American decline as “the rise of the rest.”
Power always depends on context, and in today’s world, it is distributed in a pattern that resembles a complex three-dimensional chess game.
On the top chessboard, military power is largely unipolar and likely to remain so for a while.
But on the middle chessboard, economic power is already multi-polar, with the US, Europe, Japan and China as the major players, and others gaining in importance.
The bottom chessboard is the realm of transnational relations that cross borders outside of government control.
It includes actors as diverse as bankers electronically transferring sums larger than most national budgets, as well as terrorists transferring weapons or hackers disrupting Internet operations.
It also includes new challenges like pandemics and climate change.
On this bottom board, power is widely dispersed, and it makes no sense to speak of unipolarity, multipolarity, or hegemony.
Even in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the giddy pace of technological change is likely to continue to drive globalization, but the political effects will be different for the world of nation-states and the world of non-state actors.
In inter-state politics, the most important factor will be the continuing “return of Asia.”
In 1750, Asia had three-fifths of the world population and three-fifths of the world’s economic output.
By 1900, after the industrial revolution in Europe and America, Asia accounted for just one-fifth of world output.
By 2040, Asia will be well on its way back to its historical share.
The rise of China and India may create instability, but it is a problem with precedents, and we can learn from history about how policies can affect the outcome.
A century ago, Britain managed the rise of American power without conflict, but the world’s failure to manage the rise of German power led to two devastating world wars.
The rise of non-state actors also must be managed.
In 2001, a non-state group killed more Americans than the government of Japan killed at Pearl Harbor.
A pandemic spread by birds or travelers on jet aircraft could kill more people than perished in World Wars I or II.
The problems of the diffusion of power (away from states) may turn out to be more difficult than shifts in power between states.
The challenge for Barack Obama is that more and more issues and problems are outside the control of even the most powerful state.
Although the US does well on the traditional measures of power, those measures increasingly fail to capture much of what defines world politics, which, owing to the information revolution and globalization, is changing in a way that prevents Americans from achieving all their international goals by acting alone.
For example, international financial stability is vital to American prosperity, but the US needs the cooperation of others to ensure it.
Global climate change, too, will affect the quality of life, but the US cannot manage the problem alone.
And, in a world where borders are becoming increasingly porous to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism, America must mobilize international coalitions to address shared threats and challenges.
As the world’s largest economy, American leadership will remain crucial.
The problem of American power in the wake of the financial crisis is not one of decline, but of a realization that even the most powerful country cannot achieve its aims without the help of others.
Fortunately, Barack Obama understands that.

Inequality Comes to Asia
SEOUL – From China to India, Asian countries’ rapid economic expansion has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades.
Yet the income distribution has lately worsened, with inequality now potentially even more severe in Asia than in the developed economies of the West.
From 1990 to 2012, the net Gini coefficient – a common measure of (post-tax and post-transfer) income inequality – increased dramatically in China, from 0.37 to 0.51 (zero signifies perfect equality and one represents perfect inequality).
It rose in India as well, from 0.43 to 0.48.
Even the four “Asian Tigers” – Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan – which had previously grown “with equity,” have lately faced rising inequality.
In South Korea, for example, the share of income held by the top 10% rose from 29% in 1995 to 45% in 2013.
This trend is being driven largely by the same forces that have fueled Asia’s economic growth in recent decades: unbridled globalization and technological progress.
Increasingly open borders have made it easier for businesses to find the cheapest locations for their operations.
In particular, China’s entry into global markets has put downward pressure on the wages of low-skill production workers elsewhere.
Meanwhile, new technologies raise demand for skilled workers, while reducing demand for their less-skilled counterparts – a trend that fuels the expansion of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled.
Capital owners also reap major benefits from technological progress.
In short, as the Nobel laureate Angus Deaton has acknowledged, by creating new opportunities for a certain group of millions of people, while subjecting an enormous number of people to wage stagnation, unemployment, and economic precarity, globalization and technological innovation have helped to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.
Exacerbating this trend, income inequality often goes hand in hand with inequality of opportunity.
With limited educational and economic prospects, talented youth from disadvantaged backgrounds end up running in place.
As inequality becomes increasingly entrenched, it can erode the consensus in favor of pro-growth economic policies, undermine social cohesion, and spur political instability.
To avoid such a future, Asian countries need to change the rules of the game, providing opportunities for youth, whatever their background, to ascend the income ladder.
Market mechanisms are not enough to achieve this.
Governments must take action, complementing their pro-growth policies with policies aimed at ensuring that the gains are shared much more equally and sustainably.
To be sure, some Asian governments have been attempting to tackle inequality with progressive redistribution policies.
For example, South Korea’s government recently announced that it will raise the minimum wage next year by 16.4%, to 7,530 won ($6.70) per hour, and up to 55% above its current level by 2020.
It will also raise tax rates for the highest income earners and companies.
But, while such measures have strong public support, they could end up hurting the economy, by reducing business investment, for example, and impeding job creation.
In fact, the first rule of thumb in combating today’s inequality should be that simplistic egalitarian policies are not a permanent solution – and may, in fact, have adverse long-term consequences.
Consider the Venezuelan government’s decision, in the late 1990s, to implement populist redistributive policies, without addressing the economy’s overreliance on the oil industry and lack of competitiveness.
That choice has pushed the country to the edge of bankruptcy, while fueling large-scale social unrest and political turmoil.
Venezuela’s national catastrophe should serve as a warning to everyone.
The best way to enhance both equity and growth is effective development of human capital, which not only supports higher incomes today, but also ensures intergenerational mobility tomorrow.
This requires enhanced social safety nets and redistributive tax-and-transfer programs, as well as access to quality education for all.
The good news is that many East Asian economies are already investing more in public education, in order to expand opportunities for all population groups.
But more must be done.
Asia needs to improve further the quality of its higher education as well, reforming curricula to ensure that young people are getting the knowledge and skills they need to prepare them for the labor market.
Meanwhile, the labor market should be made more efficient and flexible, so that it can match people with the right jobs and reward them adequately.
As technology continues to transform the economy, life-long education and training is needed to enable workers to keep up.
Promoting the participation of girls and women in education and economic activity is also important.
Furthermore, governments should create an environment that fosters small innovative startups.
And, of course, they should sustain pro-growth policies that boost overall job creation and reduce unemployment, while rejecting barriers to trade or innovation.
In today’s charged political environment, there is a growing temptation to reject globalization and embrace populist redistribution policies that could end up doing far more harm than good.
Asia’s leaders must do better if they are to realize the true promise of “growth with equity.”

The Lucifer Effect
Why do good, ordinary people sometimes become perpetrators of evil?
The most extreme transformation of this kind is, of course, the story of God’s favorite angel, Lucifer – a story that has set the context for my psychological investigations into lesser human transformations in response to the corrosive influence of powerful situational forces.
Such forces exist in many common behavioral contexts, distorting our usual good nature by pushing us to engage in deviant, destructive, or evil behavior.
When embedded in new and unfamiliar settings, our habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and acting no longer function to sustain the moral compass that has guided us reliably in the past.
Over the past three decades, my research and that of my colleagues has demonstrated the relative ease with which ordinary people can be led to behave in ways that qualify as evil.
We have put research participants in experiments where powerful situational forces – anonymity, group pressures, or diffusion of personal responsibility – led them blindly to obey authority and to aggress against innocent others after dehumanizing them.
My recent book The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil describes the radical transformations that took place among college students playing randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison created at Stanford University.
It goes on to establish direct parallels with the abuses committed by American soldiers at Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison, presenting much of the social science research illustrating the power of social situations to dominate individual dispositions.
This body of work challenges the traditional focus on the individual’s inner nature, dispositions, and personality traits as the primary – and often the sole – factors in understanding human failings.
Instead, I argue that while most people are good most of the time, they can readily be led to act anti-socially, because most people are rarely solitary figures improvising soliloquies on the empty stage of life.
On the contrary, people are often in an ensemble of different players, on a stage with various props, costumes, scripts, and stage directions from producers and directors.
Together, they comprise situational features that can dramatically influence behavior.
What individuals bring into any setting is important, but so are the situational forces that act on them, as well as the systemic forces that create and maintain situations.
Most institutions that are invested in an individualistic orientation hold up the person as sinner, culpable, afflicted, insane, or irrational.
Programs of change follow either a medical model of rehabilitation, therapy, reeducation, and treatment, or a punitive model of incarceration and execution.
But all such programs are doomed to fail if the main causal agent is the situation or system, not the person.
As a result, two kinds of paradigm shift are required.
First, we need to adopt a public health model for prevention of violence, spouse abuse, bullying, prejudice, and more that identifies vectors of social disease to be inoculated against.
Second, legal theory must reconsider the extent to which powerful situational and systemic factors should be taken into account in punishing individuals.
Although much of The Lucifer Effect examines how easy it is for ordinary people to be seduced into engaging in evil deeds, or to be passively indifferent to the suffering of others, the deeper message is a positive one.
It is by understanding the how and why of such deeds that we are in a better position to uncover, oppose, defy, and triumph over them.
By becoming more “evil smart,” we build up resistance to having our moral compass reset negatively.
In this sense, The Lucifer Effect is a celebration of the human capacity to choose kindness over cruelty, caring over indifference, creativity over destructiveness, and heroism over villainy.
At the end of my narrative, I invite readers to consider fundamental strategies of resisting and challenging unwanted social influences, and I introduce the notion of “the banality of heroism.”
After all, most heroes are ordinary people who engage in extra-ordinary moral actions.
With this in mind, I propose a situational perspective for heroism, just as I do for evil: the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination and evil in some of us can inspire the heroic imagination in others.
We must teach people, especially our children, to think of themselves as “heroes-in-waiting,” ready to take heroic action in a particular situation that may occur only once in their lifetime.

Demographics and Development
WASHINGTON, DC – Achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals – which aim to end poverty, boost shared prosperity, and promote sustainability, between now and 2030 – will require overcoming some major obstacles, ranging from securing enough financing to addressing climate change to managing macroeconomic shocks.
But there is one potential obstacle that could turn out to be a blessing in disguise: the diverse demographic shifts that will take place in the coming years.
By the time the SDG agenda reaches its end date, there will be an estimated 8.5 billion people worldwide.
Twenty years later – just 34 years from now – there will be nearly ten billion, or nearly 2.5 billion more people than there are on Earth today.
What will such a world look like?
Where will those additional people live?
How will they make their living?
Will they bolster or weigh down national economies?
For clues, we can look 35 years in the past, to the early 1980s.
US President Ronald Reagan, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President François Mitterrand, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev dominated the world’s headlines.
Personal computer sales were miniscule.
And children competed over Rubik’s cubes, rather than augmented-reality Pokémon.
At that time, the world’s population was about 4.5 billion, 42% of whom – almost two billion – lived in extreme poverty.
Excessive population growth, it was feared, would outpace agricultural production and create yet more poverty.
Yet the Malthusian predictions were wrong.
Although the world population has surged to 7.5 billion, only about 750 million people – just 10% of the total population – live in extreme poverty today.
China and India, in particular, lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in recent decades, increasing their citizens’ incomes and improving their health.
China and India achieved this partly by strengthening institutions and pursuing policies that supported strong, relatively inclusive growth.
China, for its part, also took advantage of a “demographic dividend”: fertility rates fell, and the labor force grew faster than the dependent population, freeing up resources to invest in people and capital.
This produced higher growth and living standards.
Such a dividend can run for decades.
And, for China, it has, though it is now reaching its conclusion.
For India and other developing countries, however, the demographic dividend is just starting to be felt.
In fact, fully 90% of global poverty is concentrated in countries with growing working-age populations, creating an important opportunity for rapid poverty reduction in the coming decades.
For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently plagued with high levels of extreme poverty, children under 15 years of age account for 43% of the total population.
When these children are old enough to enter the labor force, the proportion of income-earners in the economy could be increased substantially, boosting average per capita incomes.
But not all countries are set to benefit from a “youth bulge.”
Between now and 2030, several middle-income countries will experience a decline in the share of the working-age population.
Among other things, this reflects the tendency, supported by empirical evidence, for higher incomes to impel households to delay having children.
Even here, however, the demographic news is not all bad – and not just because the shift from higher to lower fertility typically correlates with a shift from lower to higher life expectancy.
History suggests that there is a second type of demographic dividend – one that actually lasts longer and is more durable than the first – which emerges when the accumulated savings of an aging population produce a surge in investment.
Many wealthier countries have followed this path.
But reaping a demographic dividend takes work.
As the World Bank Group’s 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report emphasized, countries’ policy responses make all the difference in how demographic trends affect the wellbeing of the population.
With the wrong approach, a surging youth population can be destabilizing, and a rapidly aging population can become a burden on economic growth and public budgets.
For countries with a growing working-age population, the key challenge is to generate a large number of productive jobs.
For those with an aging population, it is to improve productivity and adapt social-welfare systems.
In both cases, investment in human capital and an enabling environment for businesses to boost employment are essential.
Furthermore, countries should take advantage of differences in their demographic situations with appropriate policies on cross-border capital flows, migration, and trade.
More capital should flow to countries with younger populations – with their growing manufacturing bases and consumer markets – to support investment and employment growth; and more labor should flow to countries with aging populations, to fill gaps in the workforce.
For all of these policies to work, countries need to improve the effectiveness and credibility of their civic and government institutions.
Mitigating uncertainty, in order to avoid fueling instability, is also essential.
The last 35 years prove that a larger population does not have to be poorer.
While the increasing concentration of the poor in fragile and conflict-affected countries will compound the challenge of poverty reduction over the next few decades, this is no excuse for not ensuring continued progress.
We have the resources and knowledge to achieve far greater prosperity, equity, and sustainability.
The real challenge will be to use them effectively.

A Metaphor for Obama
NEW HAVEN – As US President Barack Obama begins his second term, he needs a simple way to express his vision and policies for the economy – a metaphor around which support for his policies might crystallize, thereby boosting his administration’s political effectiveness.
So, what makes a successful metaphor work?
The 2008 Obama campaign used the slogan “Change we can believe in.”
But “change” is not a metaphor for a new government: it does not stand for any policies.
Nor does “Hope” or “Yes we can!”
The 2012 Obama campaign used the one-word slogan “Forward!”
Once again, it signifies nothing about policies or their underlying philosophy.
Every politician, whether liberal or conservative, wants to move forward, not backward.
Obama’s slogans are examples of “dead metaphors”: they are not part of an overall conceptual scheme.
By contrast, in the 1930’s, President Franklin Roosevelt used a metaphor that remains very much alive today.
The idea of a “new deal” was conceived during his first presidential election campaign in 1932, though at the time he was still very vague about what the term stood for.
Apparently, Roosevelt, or his speechwriters, borrowed it from A New Deal, a book by Stuart Chase that was published in 1932 and adapted the same year into a cover story for the magazine The New Republic.
Chase described his new deal in general terms as “the drastic and progressive revision of the economic structure, avoiding an utter break with the past.”
And, while the book’s specific policy proposals bear little resemblance to Roosevelt’s subsequent actions, the title had an intrinsic appeal that he must have recognized.
The New Deal created an image of a commercial transaction, like the buyout of a company or an incentive package for executives – something that contracting parties bargain over and agree to.
It is not imposed.
By calling it a “deal,” Roosevelt made clear that the plan was not anti-business: it sounded like an offer to work, to participate, to seize an opportunity.
And, because deals can be good or bad, fair or exploitative, the word “new” provided metaphoric depth, suggesting that Roosevelt’s deal was better, fairer, and more attractive.
The metaphor, overwhelmingly endorsed by voters, stood for Roosevelt’s mandate to fix the ailing economy along lines that were innovative but still essentially capitalist.
Some of his administration’s initiatives, such as the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, seemed anti-business to some at the time, but have long since been accepted as a boon to competition and dynamism by hemming in unfair or manipulative behavior.
Metaphors, it turns out, are not just words.
Modern neuroscience is revealing that metaphors are intrinsic to creativity, for their use activates diverse regions of the brain associated with their multiple meanings.
Good metaphors are those that set off the right intuitive connections in our brains.
For example, much progress in understanding sound and light resulted when scientists imagined them in terms of sea waves.
Formulating a good metaphor for Obama’s second term is itself a task for intuitive creative thought that entails rethinking what he will propose in his second term.
A good metaphor might embody the idea of an “inclusive economy.”
The word “inclusive” resonates strongly: Americans do not want more government per se; rather, they want the government to get more people involved in the market economy.
Opinion polls show that, above all, what Americans want are jobs – the beginning of inclusion.
The parallel to Chase’s book today is the 2012 bestseller Why Nations Fail by the economist Daron Acemoglu and the political scientist James Robinson.
Acemoglu and Robinson argue that in the broad sweep of history, political orders that include everyone in the economic process are more likely to succeed in the long term.
The time seems ripe for that idea, and it fits with the triumph of inclusiveness symbolized by Obama himself.
But another step in metaphor-building is needed to encapsulate the idea of economic inclusion.
The biggest successes of Obama’s first term concerned economic inclusion.
The Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) is providing more people with access to health care – and bringing more people to privately-issued insurance – than ever before in the United States.
The Dodd-Frank financial reforms created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so that privately issued financial products would serve the public better, and created incentives for derivatives to be traded on public markets.
And he signed the JOBS Act, proposed by his Republican opponents, which aims to create crowdfunding Web sites that allow small investors to participate in start-up ventures.
We have not reached the pinnacle of economic inclusion.
There are hundreds of other possibilities, including improved investor education and financial advice, more flexible mortgages, better kinds of securitization, more insurance for a broader array of life’s risks, and better management of career risks.
Much more progress toward comprehensive public futures and derivatives markets would help, as would policies to encourage the emerging world to participate more in the US economy.
(Indeed, the inclusion metaphor is essentially global in spirit; had Obama used it in the past, his economic policies might have been less protectionist.)
The right metaphor would spin some of these ideas, or others like them, into a vision for America’s future that, like the New Deal, would gain coherence as it is transformed into reality.
On January 29, Obama will give the first State of the Union address of his new term.
He should be thinking about how to express – vividly and compellingly – the principles that have guided his choices so far, and that set a path for America’s future.

Growth Out of Time
CAMBRIDGE – Robert Gordon of Northwestern University is a distinguished economist whose work in macroeconomics and studies of long-term economic growth have properly earned him high regard.
So his recent exercise in speculative future history, which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end, has attracted much favorable attention.
But a basic flaw in Gordon’s argument is immediately apparent – and becomes glaringly so on closer examination.
Gordon distinguishes three Industrial Revolutions that have driven economic growth and improved living standards since the eighteenth century: IR #1 (“steam, railroads”), whose defining inventions date from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (“electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum”), whose defining inventions date from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (“computers, the web, mobile phones”), dating from 1960.
The core of his article contrasts the transformational impact of IR #1 and, especially, IR #2 on per capita GDP and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of IR #3.
The vulnerability of Gordon’s argument is his shortened time horizon for IR #3.
Consider the following four sentences in his paper:
· “Both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy.”
· “At a minimum, it took 150 years for IR #1 to have its full range of effects.”
· “The inventions of IR #2 were so important…that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect.”
· “…[T]he productivity impact of IR #3 evaporated after only eight years, compared to the 81 years (1891-1972) required for the benefits of IR #2 to have their full impact…”
The last sentence is crucial: Gordon cuts off IR #3 circa 2005 – that is, 45 years from its onset, but less than half the time allowed for IR #1 and IR #2 to run their respective courses.
To take a salient example from the prior industrial revolutions, this is as if the impact of the railroads on the US economy were to be measured as of 1873, 45 years after construction began on America’s first line, the Baltimore & Ohio.
In 1873, the retailer Montgomery Ward was just a year old, and the first Sears Roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away.
Together, these companies invented mail order as the “killer app” of the railroad age, creating a continental market for consumer goods, with all of the economies of scale that followed.
Or, to take another example, what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electrification only 45 years after the first generating plant, Thomas Edison’s Pearl Street Station, became operational in 1882?
At that point, America’s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible (re)configuration, which enabled distribution of generated electric power, while America’s home-appliance industry was in its infancy.
Gordon asserts that “the era of computers replacing human labor was largely over” during the past decade.
Innovation in information and communications technology (ICT) focused first on electronic commerce, “itself largely completed by 2005.”
After that, “labor-saving innovation” took a back seat to “a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.”
In thus truncating and trivializing the ongoing ICT revolution, Gordon misses two fundamental processes.
First, and most evident, the rise of e-commerce is far from over.
In the US, the most advanced country in this respect, e-commerce has just reached 10% of total retail spending, and is continuing to grow at double-digit rates through the slow recovery from the Great Recession.
At the same time, something much more significant is happening beneath the economic surface.
From the early days of the computer revolution, researchers and popularizers envisioned “artificial intelligence” as the ultimate killer app (literally, in the case of the computer HAL in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey).
Decades of frustration are now yielding to success: the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures.
For proof of artificial intelligent “life,” consider the “virtual assistants” populating smart phones, beginning – but just beginning – with Apple’s Siri.
The next wave of IR #3’s consequences can be discerned in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed transaction, and in the application of predictive analytics to industrial supply chains and service provisioning.
If these innovations’ prospective impact on productivity and GDP growth cannot be quantified, well, that is the way it is with future history.
Flawed as Gordon’s reading of IR #3 is, his concluding concern for the future of innovation in the US is well founded.
Of the assorted “headwinds” that he cites, the enormous increase in inequality and the plateau reached in educational attainment represent threats that differentiate America’s position from that of other advanced countries.
But Gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued US global leadership in innovation: the delegitimation over the past generation of the state’s role as an economic actor.
As I illustrate and analyze at length in my new book, Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy: Markets, Speculation and the State, the state has become central to the Innovation Economy’s dynamics.
It funds the upstream research that generates discovery and invention; supports the creation of new networks, from canals to the Internet; and serves as a creative customer for innovative products, as it did during the computer revolution’s nascence.
The state must also preserve continuity in the market economy when the speculative bubble that has funded its transformation bursts.
And here, too, Gordon disappoints.
The only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabilizing role. Rather, it is to the asserted headwind represented by the very debt incurred to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from triggering a second Great Depression.

Financial Inclusion Now
KUALA LUMPUR – Making the financial system accessible to the world’s poorest people can unlock their economic potential, improve their lives, and benefit the wider economy.
So it is no surprise that financial inclusion of the poor has become an important component of public policymaking.
Central banks and regulators worldwide are taking the lead in making financial inclusion a priority, in addition to their traditional mandates of maintaining monetary and financial stability.
Financial inclusion is about providing an opportunity for the world’s 2.5 billion unbanked and financially underserved to participate in the formal financial system, thereby helping to lift them out of poverty and enter the economic mainstream.
Greater financial inclusiveness promises a more cohesive society and more balanced growth and development.
Moreover, financial systems themselves stand to benefit from becoming more comprehensive and progressive.
The additional consumers participating in the formal financial system will strengthen national economies and, in turn, enrich the global economy.
Indeed, as developing countries move toward middle-income status, financial inclusion is a key component of continued progress.
In countries with high levels of financial exclusion, consumers are left to rely on unregulated informal services.
These inferior substitutes often imply exorbitant costs for borrowers – and financing that is usually too short term for productive investment activity.
Moreover, the lack of consumer protection and regulatory and supervisory frameworks exposes informal activities to vulnerabilities that can harm borrowers and jeopardize financial stability.
Increasing the availability of formal financial services to those who have long been denied them requires establishing a balanced regulatory framework.
Oppressive, blanket regulation, which may be necessary in complex and unpredictable financial markets, may not be relevant in a rural community – or, worse, it may stifle efforts to promote financial inclusion.
Indeed, proportionality is an important aspect of regulation, enabling prudential measures that, rather than exceed or underestimate, are commensurate with the risks that need to be addressed.
Little wonder, then, that high levels of exclusion in developing and emerging countries have prompted policymakers to embrace proportionate regulation, thereby gaining the flexibility to encourage innovation in the provision of financial services while preserving financial stability.
Bangladesh, for example, has adapted its financial regulations for microfinance institutions.
This has helped to catalyze the growth of sustainable microfinancing to local women-owned enterprises.
Kenya’s “test and learn” approach to regulation has unleashed the potential of mobile-phone-based financial-service delivery through M-PESA, which offers consumers a safe and convenient alternative to cash.
There are many other examples of successful implementation of proportionate regulation that have resulted in greater financial inclusion without compromising financial stability.
In Malaysia, agent-banking regulation (which safeguards consumers’ interests while supporting financial institutions’ business models) has led to the expansion of branchless banking to reach previously unserved rural areas.
Similarly, Mexico’s “tiered” approach to financial access – according to which requirements for opening bank accounts are proportionate to risk, with low-value accounts subject to higher transaction restrictions – has expanded access to basic accounts, while mitigating the risk of money laundering.
And Pakistan and Indonesia, by basing capital requirements for microfinance institutions on the size of the population that they expect to serve, are enabling these institutions to serve distinct market niches sustainably.
Policymakers in many countries have recently been considering the role of financial standard-setting bodies (SSBs) in advancing financial inclusion.
In particular, they are focusing on the specific challenges that arise when applying supervisory standards in a developing country that is pursuing financial stability and inclusion.
Although global standards supposedly reflect the principles of proportionality, they provide insufficient guidance for the national regulators, banking institutions, and financial-sector assessors who are trying to apply them effectively in diverse environments.
This lack of contextual clarity has led to excessively conservative interpretations of the regulations – and thus to the creation of unintended barriers to financial inclusion.
Addressing this will require input from policymakers with practical experience applying international standards, particularly in emerging economies.
At the same time, in order to ensure continued progress toward financial inclusion, representatives from developing and emerging economies must play a greater role in shaping future standards.
The Alliance for Financial Inclusion, a network of central bankers and financial policymakers from more than 80 developing countries, is already contributing to more effective and proportionate global regulation by facilitating increased engagement with SSBs. This September, Malaysia’s central bank will advance the process by hosting AFI’s Global Policy Forum.
Such collaborative efforts among developing countries ultimately foster closer cooperation between them and their developed counterparts.
This will lead to better outcomes for the global financial system, the global real economy, and, most important, the people who have been excluded from both for far too long.

Europe’s Ukrainian Lifeline
NEW YORK – Last weekend’s European Parliament election and presidential election in Ukraine produced sharply contrasting results.
Europe’s voters expressed their dissatisfaction with the way that the European Union currently functions, while Ukraine’s people demonstrated their desire for association with the EU.
European leaders and citizens should take this opportunity to consider what that means – and how helping Ukraine can also help Europe.
The EU was originally conceived to be an ever-closer association of sovereign states willing to pool a gradually increasing share of their sovereignty for the common good.
It was a bold experiment in international governance and the rule of law, aimed at replacing nationalism and the use of force.
Unfortunately the euro crisis transformed the EU into something radically different: a relationship of creditors and debtors in which the creditor countries impose conditions that perpetuate their dominance.
Given low turnout for the European Parliament election, and if support for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi were added to the anti-EU vote on the left and the right, it could be argued that the majority of citizens are opposed to current conditions.
Meanwhile, just as Europe’s bold experiment in international governance is faltering, Russia is emerging as a dangerous rival to the EU, one that has global geopolitical ambitions and is willing to use force.
Putin is exploiting an ethnic national ideology (and support from the Orthodox Church) to bolster his regime.
Indeed, speaking on the Russian radio program Direct Line last month, he extolled the genetic virtues of the Russian people.
The annexation of Crimea has made him popular at home, and his effort to weaken America’s global dominance, in part by seeking an alliance with China, has resonated favorably in the rest of the world.
But the Putin regime’s self-interest is at odds with Russia’s strategic interests; Russia would benefit more from closer cooperation with the EU and the United States.
And resorting to repression in Russia and Ukraine is directly counterproductive.
The Russian economy is weakening, despite the high price of oil, owing to the flight of capital and talent.
Using violence in Kyiv’s Maidan has led to the birth of a new Ukraine that is determined not to become part of a new Russian empire.
The success of the new Ukraine would constitute an existential threat to Putin’s rule in Russia.
That is why he has tried so hard to destabilize Ukraine by fostering self-declared separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
With the Donbas region’s largest employer mobilizing protests against the separatists, Putin’s plan may not work, and he is now likely to accept the results of the presidential election, thereby avoiding additional sanctions.
But Russia is likely to seek other avenues to destabilize the new Ukraine, which should not be too difficult, given that the security forces, having served the corrupt regime of former President Viktor Yanukovych, are demoralized and not necessarily loyal to the new leadership.
All of this has happened very fast and very recently.
Both the EU and the US are preoccupied with their internal problems and remain largely unaware of the geopolitical and ideological threat that Putin’s Russia poses.
How should they respond?
The first task is to counteract Russia’s efforts to destabilize Ukraine.
With the EU’s “fiscal compact” and other rules limiting the scope of government assistance, innovative thinking is needed.
The single most effective measure would be to offer free political risk insurance to those who invest in or do business with Ukraine.
This would keep the economy running, despite the political turmoil, and it would signal to Ukrainians that the EU and the US – governments and private investors alike – are committed to them.
Businesses would flock to a newly open and promising market if they were fully compensated for losses caused by political events beyond their control.
Political risk insurance may sound too complex to deploy quickly.
In fact, insurance of this type already exists.
Private insurers and reinsurers like Germany’s Euler Hermes have offered it for years.
So have government institutions, like the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
They must, however, charge substantial premiums to cover the cost of reinsurance.
Faced with high premiums, most businesses would simply opt to wait on the sidelines until the storm passed.
That is why the governments concerned must take over the reinsurance function and use their agencies only to administer the insurance policies.
They could guarantee the losses in the same way as they underwrite the World Bank: each government would provide a modest pro-rata capital infusion and commit the rest in the form of callable capital that would be available if and when losses are actually paid out.
The EU would have to modify the fiscal compact to exempt the callable capital and allow actual losses to be amortized over a number of years.
Guarantees of this kind have a peculiar feature: the more convincing they are, the less likely they are to be invoked; the reinsurance is likely to turn out to be largely costless.
The World Bank is a living example.
By acting promptly and convincingly, the EU could save Ukraine – and itself.
What I propose for Ukraine could also be implemented at home.
As long as there are so many productive resources lying idle, it would make sense to exempt from the fiscal compact investments that would eventually pay for themselves.
Renzi, for one, is advocating precisely this course of action.
Putin plans to turn Crimea into a showcase by lavishing more than €50 billion on it in the next few years.
With European support, Ukraine could compare favorably.
And, if such an initiative marks the beginning of a growth policy that Europe so badly needs, by saving Ukraine Europe would also be saving itself.

Back to the Brink in Ukraine
The campaign for Ukraine’s parliamentary election of September 30th is scarcely underway and yet Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych is already trying to steal it.
Yanukovych was the man who sought to falsify the result of the presidential election of 2004, inciting the Orange Revolution. Back then, a peaceful and honest result was reached in the end because Ukraine’s President Leonid Kuchma refused to heed Yanukovych’s call to use violence to defend his rigged election.
This time it appears that Yanukovych is prepared to do anything to remain in power.
The dirty tricks began in the midnight hours of August 11th, when Ukraine’s Central Election Commission (which is packed with Yanukovych placemen) refused to certify the largest opposition party, the bloc of former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko, to participate in the election.
The technicality the commission cited would be absurdly funny if its potential results were not so incendiary: the CEC objected to the fact that the Tymoshenko bloc candidates listed only their home towns on the party list, not their precise street address.
But Tymoshenko’s party successfully submitted its list in the very same format at the March 2006 election, which demonstrates the glaringly partisan nature of the election commission’s ruling.
By seeking to cling to power by hook or by crook, Yanukovych is likely to bring on the deluge.
In Ukraine that means not only violent unrest, but economic decline and renewed repression. At the end of the day it could lead to the sort of huge street protests that marked the Orange Revolution, and their attempted violent suppression.
Recent history is replete with alarming examples of dictators and would be dictators who refuse to recognize when their time has run out.
But for the past twenty years their blatant political chicanery has been met with a potent new force: the massed voices of ordinary people who refuse to be cowed.
From the “People Power” revolution that toppled Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986 to Boris Yeltsin’s defiance of the attempted coup against Mikhail Gorbachev of August 1991, to the Rose, Orange, and Cedar Revolutions of recent years, dictators have been forced to admit defeat when enough people stand up to them.
Will it really be necessary for Ukrainians to repeat the Orange Revolution by again gathering in their millions to shame Yanukovych (a twice convicted violent felon before he entered politics) to change course?
There is a person who might compel Yanukovych to retreat to democratic norms and thus hold off such protests -- Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.
It is certainly in Russia’s national interest to prevent chaos in the country’s big next door neighbor.
But Putin’s idea of what constitutes Russia’s national interest makes that type of intervention unlikely.
Weak neighbors are states that the Kremlin can control, so why not expand Russian power by letting Ukraine slide into protest and anarchy if by doing so it brings that country back under Putin’s thumb?
Moreover, Putin himself is in the business of sterilizing Russia’s democratic processes by handpicking his successor and having his courts and electoral commissions block his opponents from political participation, often tarring them as traitors.
Someone with such contempt for the democratic rights of his own people is unlikely to champion them abroad.
As is usual with this ex-KGB man, Putin is being cunning about Ukraine, but he is deluding himself if he thinks that siding with Yanukovych will bring back effective Russian overlordship of Ukraine.
The days of empire are over, no matter how much wealth oil and gas is bringing to Russia.
Only if Ukraine maintains its independence will the imperial nostalgia of Russia’s elites be shattered.
So other pressure will need to be applied, primarily by the European Union and the United States.
In 2004, both the EU and US were tardy in speaking in defense of Ukraine’s democrats. Only when the courage of millions of ordinary Ukrainians gathered in central Kyiv galvanized world opinion did the US and EU marshal the courage to stand up for an honest election result.
And the one state that did stand with Ukraine from the start back then, Poland, has now antagonized much of EU opinion, particularly in Germany, because of the paranoid behavior of its current leaders.
So Polish influence in Union councils is at rock bottom.
Luckily, the leaders of Europe’s three biggest states are different people than in 2004.
Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Gordon Brown appear to have a clearer appreciation of the Union’s security problems to its east, and so may find the will to act decisively now, rather than dither as their predecessors did when Ukraine moved into crisis in 2004.
Unless Ukraine’s democratic opposition is allowed to take part in the election, a new crisis is certain.
Tymoshenko, who has survived three assassination attempts, is not the type of woman to surrender her campaign on a technicality.
While the Orange Revolution made ordinary Ukrainians more conscious of their rights than ever before, this alone cannot guarantee that they are certain to see those rights vindicated in the coming weeks.
However, it will make the job of repressing them much harder.
And isn’t that what the battle for democracy is all about?

China Has Made Me Invisible
LONDON – I have just discovered that I never really existed, at least as far as the goons in the Communist Party of China are concerned.
In their latest effort to turn Hong Kong into a police state – it can only be a matter of time before a tear-gas shell or a Taser replaces the bauhinia flower as the city’s emblem – the Chinese authorities have taken further steps to throttle the education system.
For Communists, education is above all about engineering the soul.
So, the CPC has now gotten rid of any school textbooks that might tell the truth about Hong Kong’s past and its aspirations.
The CPC has even gone so far as to deny that Hong Kong was ever a British colony; it was simply an occupied territory, apparently.
No colony means no governor, a post I held from 1992 until Hong Kong’s handover to Chinese rule five years later.
When I left Hong Kong, I noted that no one at the end of the twentieth century would want to justify colonial rule.
But one cannot deny that it existed in Hong Kong from the 1840s onward, with the United Kingdom acquiring part of the territory via grants and part on a 99-year lease.
The city’s incoming chief executive, John Lee, knows this perfectly well.
He served as a police officer under British colonial governors like me and must have sworn an oath to the colony’s government.
Although they lived in a colony, Hong Kong’s residents enjoyed far more freedom under British rule than they now do under Chinese communism.
That is why many of them are fleeing the city and why many regard themselves as Hong Kongers or Hong Kong Chinese rather than simply Chinese.
Opinion polls that highlight this fact will of course be stopped or censored.
Lee himself had a British passport until 2012, when he had to surrender it to become a government minister.
His wife and two sons still have British passports.
Good for them, although I am surprised that their presumed pride in China allows this.
I wonder how long it will be before the government in Beijing and its loyal servants in Hong Kong try to erase the fact that more than two-thirds of the city’s population are related to refugees who fled communist brutality to find peace, freedom, and a better life in a British colony.
Perhaps we must now call it a formerly occupied territory.
But what an irony that it was occupied mostly by Chinese refugees from CPC rule.
The Chinese authorities’ current revisionism is of course entirely consistent with how totalitarian regimes view history.
When he first came to power, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed party and government workers to fight what Communists call historical nihilism.
History must be whatever the party says it is.
Inconvenient facts and evidence are simply made to disappear.
This is apparent in the CPC’s attempt to erase knowledge in Hong Kong of the 1989 Tiananmen killings, when the People’s Liberation Army gunned down mostly young Chinese citizens.
The late American journalist Jonathan Mirsky, who was a friend of mine, witnessed the massacre.
A student standing next to him, listening to the sound of rifle fire, said to Jonathan, “Don’t worry.
The soldiers are using blanks.”
Moments later, the young man fell dead at Jonathan’s feet, a hole in his forehead.
This murder made Jonathan even more determined to call out evil whenever he saw it.
And too much of the CPC’s history is evil, including most recently the crimes against humanity it is committing against Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang province.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the Hong Kong government has outlawed the commemorative vigils in the city for the Tiananmen massacre, which previously took place every year on June 4.
In 2021, the police even photographed people entering churches to pray for those who were murdered, in order to discourage Catholics from doing this in the future.
Xi is also trying to rewrite history to help his friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In a recent message of support to Putin, Xi and China’s state media repeated the lie that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a defensive act to counter threats to Russia from its neighbors.
Xi has doubled down on his support for Russia and is now more clearly Putin’s accomplice, a point we should not forget as long as Xi remains in power.
Before China broke its promises and international agreements, and moved vengefully and comprehensively to stamp out Hong Kong’s freedom, rule of law, and local autonomy, the city was helping to safeguard China’s long-term “memory palace.” Books, films, paintings, and sculptures were produced to tell the story of what really happened in the past.
These are all gone now.
The books have been locked away or perhaps burned, the films censored, and the sculptures and paintings seized.
But while authoritarian states such as China and Russia can suppress the scholars who want to write truthfully about the past, they cannot bury the truth itself by obliterating people’s memories and experiences.
History can be an insurrectionary discipline, which is why totalitarian dictatorships cannot abide it.
One day, the history of what has happened in Hong Kong will be told honestly and in many cases from memory.
Like the history of communism in China, it cannot be suppressed forever.
That prospect terrifies Xi, and also explains why Lee’s family, like that of the city’s outgoing chief executive, Carrie Lam, will probably hold onto their British passports.

Why Try Trump?
CHICAGO – Former President Donald Trump’s trial in the United States Senate has begun, but already a great deal of confusion has arisen about fundamental questions.
Trump’s lawyers argue that the Senate is not permitted to hold a trial at all.
The Constitution says that, “The President … shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”
Trump, according to his lawyers, cannot be removed from an office that he no longer occupies.
But the Constitution also states that, “Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”
The House impeachment managers (who act as prosecutors in the Senate trial) note that disqualification can apply only to a former officeholder.
The reason is that removal is automatic upon conviction by the Senate, while disqualification would require a further vote on the fate of the now-former officeholder.
A person who is impeached and removed no longer holds office, and yet the Senate would be entitled to vote that he be disqualified.
Because the House voted to impeach Trump while he was president, there can be no credible doubt about the legitimacy of a Senate trial.
Imagine a law that says that a police officer found to have abused her authority may be fired and prohibited from being rehired. It would be odd if she could evade the sanction of disqualification simply by resigning – and thus no longer being a police officer – after termination proceedings were launched but before they were completed.
The only difference with Trump is that his term expired.
So much for the language of the Constitution.
As is nearly always the case, founding-era debates and historical practice provide little additional guidance.
While genuflection to the founding text is de rigueur nowadays, the real question is whether a Senate trial leading to disqualification of a former president who had been impeached by the House while still in office would do harm to the US constitutional system.
It is hard to see how it could.
Whether the subject of the trial is a president or former president, conviction requires two-thirds of the senators present (after a majority in the House approve articles of impeachment).
That threshold is so high that it would be reached only in a case of egregious presidential misconduct.
Is “incitement to insurrection” egregious enough?
Unfortunately, under current political conditions, it probably isn’t.
Impeachment is best understood as a political sanction that will be imposed only when there is sufficient political support for removing a president or, as in this case, disqualifying a former president from holding office in the future.
And, despite the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Americans remain divided about Trump.
Republican senators must weigh the risk of losing votes to challengers in party primaries if they vote to convict Trump against the risk of losing the support of moderates in the general election if they vote to acquit him.
Because most conservative states will send Republicans to the Senate, most Republican senators will be warier of primary challenges and vote against conviction.
In fact, those senators would rather not vote at all – and not be tarnished in the general election – which is why all but six Republicans preferred to vote that the Senate lacks jurisdiction to try Trump.
But Democrats may have done them a favor by overreaching in another respect: by alleging in the single article of impeachment that Trump incited an insurrection.
In both ordinary language and legal terms, an insurrection is an uprising against the government.
The House managers argue that Trump incited a mob to overthrow the government.
In a technical sense, we might call the mob action an insurrection, even though at the time Trump was the head of the government that he supposedly sought to overthrow.
At least some members of the mob hoped to kill, abduct, or intimidate members of Congress and (somehow) prevent Congress from certifying the election.
The argument is that Trump not only sparked the mob’s march on the Capitol, but also anticipated such a result and deliberately brought it about.
Then, once the violence began, he did too little to stop it.
Maybe.
But the better reading of events is that Trump was being Trump.
By the standards of previous American presidents and virtually all American politicians, he was extraordinarily reckless in insisting for two months that the election was stolen and then in using inflammatory language with the crowd that had gathered to protest the election results.
But he did not directly ask the crowd to engage in violence, and there is no evidence that he anticipated that they would.
Trump, like everyone else, must have expected that the police would keep the crowd under control, and would not have expected them to invade the Capitol (something that has not happened since the War of 1812, when British troops occupied Washington).
Moreover, if Trump had been a private citizen, his speech at the rally would have been protected by the First Amendment.
Even if he had called for revolution, he would have done nothing illegal, as long as he did not direct a mob to engage in “imminent” violence.
Trump’s lawyers argue that the First Amendment protects the president in his official capacity as well.
But no one has ever considered the possibility that a president would stir up American citizens to attack Congress.
A president with immense influence and reach poses a far greater danger to public order if he tells lies and stirs up anger than an ordinary rabble-rouser who stands on a stump and preaches revolution.
But the claim that Trump incited an insurrection is a stretch, and Republican senators seeking to justify acquitting him will argue that whatever he did, it was not insurrection.
The real reason to disqualify Trump is that he is a menace to American institutions whose reckless, power-mad antics almost undermined an election and will sow mischief for years to come.
This should be plainly said.
Then it’s up to the House managers to persuade Senate Republicans – and, more important, the citizens who may vote for them – that this man should not be allowed to run for office ever again.

A Moral Theory’s Immoral Outcome
PRINCETON – Is it always wrong to take an innocent human life?
Many philosophical defenders of the Roman Catholic natural-law tradition argue that there are no exceptions to this prohibition, at least if we are talking about taking the life intentionally, and directly, rather than as a side effect of some other action.
(These moral theorists also define “innocent” to exclude enemy combatants, as long as the war one is fighting is just.)
When this view is combined – as it typically is in Catholic teaching – with the claim that every offspring of human parents is a living human being from the moment of conception, the implication is that abortion is never permissible.
But the case of a 22-year-old El Salvadorian woman, identified in the media only as Beatriz, makes the absoluteness of that view very difficult to defend.
Beatriz, the mother of a young son, suffers from lupus, an autoimmune disease, and other complications.
Her first pregnancy was very difficult.
Then she became pregnant again, and her doctors said that the longer the pregnancy continued, the greater the risk that it would kill her.
For most women, that alone would be sufficient grounds to terminate the pregnancy.
But Beatriz had an additional powerful reason to do so: the fetus had anencephaly, a condition in which the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain associated with consciousness, is absent.
Almost all babies with this condition die soon after birth; the few survivors are incapable of responding even to their mother’s smile.
In countries with prenatal screening and liberal abortion laws, anencephaly has become very rare, because almost all women who are told that they are carrying an anencephalic fetus choose to terminate the pregnancy.
While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws, Latin America has remained true to the faith, maintaining some of the world’s strictest legal prohibitions.
Last year, in the Dominican Republic, a 16-year-old girl with cancer was, for several weeks, refused chemotherapy because she was pregnant and the doctors worried that the potentially life-saving treatment might induce an abortion.
Although the girl was later allowed to begin treatment, both she and the fetus died.
In El Salvador, abortion is prohibited without exception.
In April, Beatriz’s doctors asked the courts to allow them to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds, but were refused.
On May 29, the Supreme Court denied Beatriz’s appeal.
To anyone concerned about human well-being – or, for that matter, human flourishing in general – such an outcome makes no sense.
Aborting an anencephalic fetus ends a life that may be human, insofar as it is the life of a member of the species Homo sapiens; but it is a life that will have zero well-being, for the infant (if it lives) will be incapable of enjoying anything.
On the other hand, not permitting Beatriz to have an abortion would risk causing the death of a young woman who desperately wanted to live, and had much to live for.
It would also risk depriving her one-year-old son of his mother.
After the Supreme Court’s decision, El Salvador’s health minister, Maria Rodriguez, announced that Beatriz would be permitted to undergo a “premature Caesarean section,” which she said was not an abortion, but an “induced birth.”
That procedure was carried out on June 3; the anencephalic newborn died five hours later.
If that was supposed to be a better outcome than an earlier termination of the pregnancy, it is hard to see for whom it was better.
It was certainly not better for Beatriz, who is still in intensive care, and for whom the long-term health impact of the pregnancy remains unclear.
And how did it benefit the anencephalic infant to have another couple of months of life in utero, and then five hours of life outside?
One point overlooked in the discussion of Beatriz’s case is that the same Catholic natural-law theory that insists that killing an innocent human being is always wrong also provides a basis for arguing that it is not wrong to kill an anencephalic fetus.
In innumerable texts, Catholic philosophers, theologians, and bioethicists argue that it is always wrong to kill innocent human beings, because, in contrast to nonhuman animals, they have a “rational nature.”
Proponents of this argument use that term to include beings that are not yet capable of rationality but will become so in the normal course of their development.
The use of the term “being with a rational nature” is very broad, perhaps too broad even when applied to normal fetuses.
To apply it to anencephalic fetuses requires a further, and much more dubious, step.
Thomas Aquinas, for instance, did not think that a rational nature is present in every member of the species Homo sapiens.
He believed that some degree of development is necessary for the human animal to become a being with a rational nature.
In the case of an anencephalic fetus, no such development is possible.
It cannot become a rational being.
For that reason, even those who believe that it is always wrong intentionally to kill an innocent being with a rational nature should not have opposed permitting Beatriz to terminate her pregnancy.
They should have embraced a humane solution that minimized the risk of a tragic ending to a story that was already sad enough.

The Chinese Economy’s Great Wall
LONDON – As we move through 2021, there are more signs of a return to pre-pandemic normalcy, at least in countries not reeling from dangerous new variants of the coronavirus.
High-frequency economic indicators in many parts of the world are strengthening, concerns about mass unemployment are giving way to inflation fears, and the G7 has just held an in-person summit.
But there is a problem at the heart of the global economy: China’s interactions with the rest of the world appear to have taken a further negative turn because of the pandemic.
Having created the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) category in 2001, I have closely followed China’s ascent, and have come to be seen as a China bull.
I became excited about the country’s economic potential in 1990, when I visited Beijing for the first time while working for the Swiss Bank Corporation.
As I strolled the capital’s bustling street markets, I was surprised by how normal it felt.
Might this supposedly “communist” country become a major force in the world economy?
That question stayed in my mind throughout the 1990s, partly owing to international macroeconomists’ persistent hand-wringing about the world economy’s growing dependence on US consumption.
Those concerns had been building since my earliest days as a professional economist in the 1980s, when I found myself at the center of the policy dilemmas surrounding the Plaza (1985) and Louvre (1987) Accords.
At the time, US policymakers were eager to boost domestic demand in other developed countries (namely, Germany and Japan).
And following China’s relative success in handling the 1997 Asian financial crisis, I came to see it as the alternative global engine that everyone had been looking for.
But the goal of boosting domestic consumption poses a dilemma for the Chinese development model.
Most data show that Chinese consumer spending still probably accounts for less than 40% of the country’s overall GDP.
Investment spending and exports are what have fueled the Chinese juggernaut for most of the past three decades (and especially the early years).
China’s modest consumption-to-GDP ratio stands in stark contrast to that of the United States, which, at around 70%, is probably excessive.
The upshot, in terms of the global economy, is that Chinese consumer spending is technically only about one-third that of US consumer spending.
But several additional points are worth noting.
While Chinese consumer spending remains relatively low, it has increased from around one-sixth that of the US over the past 20 years.
Moreover, this marginal growth has had a much more powerful effect on the global economy than have changes in US consumption.
And the Chinese consumer’s global influence has enormous potential to rise further relative to that of the US.
It is therefore in everyone’s interest that Chinese consumption demand continue to increase.
While it is unlikely that China’s consumption spending will ever reach 70% of GDP, an increase to 50% is a perfectly reasonable and desirable target for both China and the world.
If China’s GDP (in current US dollars) were to grow to match that of the US by 2030, a 50% consumption-to-GDP ratio would imply an additional $4 trillion of consumer spending globally.
In their latest deliberations, China’s leaders expressed a desire to double household incomes over the next 15 years, which would imply an average annual increase of around 4.5% in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP.
Given China’s aging workforce, this target is much more realistic than one attempting to match the double-digit growth rates of the past, and it would be broadly consistent with the Chinese economy’s rise to parity with the US.
But if China’s consumption-to-GDP ratio does not increase, I doubt it will achieve its goal.
Like any other country, China’s economic growth will be driven over the medium term by the rate of productivity growth and the size and composition of its labor force.
Because the labor force has stopped growing, additional economic growth will have to come from increased productivity.
Here, China must resolve a major contradiction.
Typically, an economy’s most productive sectors are in manufacturing, not services; and it is in manufacturing that additional productivity gains are easiest to achieve.
But China must simultaneously boost the role of personal consumption, which generally implies higher demand for services.
Achieving both objectives simultaneously is easier said than done.
I suspect that Chinese policymakers have not yet thought enough about this dilemma or about how it might affect China’s other international challenges.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear that China’s economy is simply too big for its policymakers to ignore the global implications of their decision-making.
Issues ranging from Chinese tech giants like Huawei to the presence of Chinese students at Western universities had become sources of tension.
And, of course, there are international concerns about China’s human-rights record and the domestic failures that allowed COVID-19 to escalate from an outbreak to a pandemic.
At the end of the day, China will need the rest of the world if it is to increase both domestic consumption and productivity.
The best way that China can improve its international standing is through soft diplomacy that respects other countries preferences and aspirations, rather than treating them as sources of confrontation.
Without such a change in attitude, China will not reach its goal of doubling incomes within 15 years, leaving its people – and the rest of us – worse off as a result.

The Agony of Hillary Clinton
WASHINGTON, DC – Being Hillary Clinton, one of the most celebrated women in the world, holder of some of the highest offices in American politics, and possibly the next president of the United States, has had more than its share of agony.
Widely regarded a year ago as a shoo-in for the Democratic Party’s nomination, she has faced a far more difficult slog than anyone, including her, ever contemplated.
Yet most of the problems Clinton is encountering were predictable and foreshadowed in 2008, when she ran against Barack Obama.
Others she has brought on herself.
For one thing, she’s simply not a very good politician.
Clinton is the only person known to have launched her campaign twice.
(The first attempt, in Iowa, where she talked to about eight people in closed meetings, didn’t work out very well.)
This impressive, remarkably intelligent woman just doesn’t have the feel for politics that is demanded at the highest levels.
Success in US presidential politics requires superb intuition, being quick on one’s feet, and, above all, a compelling rationale for running.
True, Clinton offers numerous programs that she would push as president; but, to borrow from Winston Churchill, there is no theme to her pudding.
The closest she comes to a message is a less-than-soaring “I’m a progressive who can get things done.”
By contrast, her rival, Bernie Sanders, has become a serious contender because he brilliantly composed a persuasive message for his campaign: The system is rigged and a corrupt campaign-finance regime is holding it in place.
The sweeping programs Sanders is pushing – a single-payer health-care system and free tuition at public colleges – however impracticable, are popular, especially among younger people, who overwhelmingly favor him over Clinton.
Her message is one of incrementalism: Don’t dare to dream big.
Meanwhile, Sanders is preaching a political revolution.
Then there’s the issue of trustworthiness.
Sanders’s integrity comes across as unimpeachable, while Clinton continues to provide reasons for questioning hers.
She and her advisers are clearly stunned by the force of the challenge she’s facing.
Sanders appears authentic; Clinton seems programmed.
She sometimes seems to be tone-deaf, particularly out of tune with the public mood on the subject of money.
Anger at the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else has been brewing for years.
Shortly before she began her campaign, Hillary Clinton said that when they left the White House she and her husband were “dead broke.”
If so, they recovered quickly: Bill and Hillary Clinton are believed to be worth well over $100 million, all of it made since they left the White House and most of it through astronomical speaking fees.
Not unlike other former US presidents – Jimmy Carter is a notable exception – the Clintons exploited their fame and influence to build up a fortune.
It’s not so much how they made most of their money as who paid them.
While Bill made business deals with some shady international figures, Hillary made a lot of her fortune by giving speeches to Wall Street firms, the main target of public wrath for causing the Great Recession of 2008.
This provided an ideal target for Sanders, who singled out the fact that Clinton earned $675,000 for three speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs.
Sanders’s charges put her back on her heels; when asked by the moderator in a CNN Town Hall why she accepted so much money from Goldman Sachs, a nonplussed Clinton shrugged and replied, “That’s what they offered.”
Then there’s the controversy over her having chosen to use a private, unsecured server installed at her home in Chappaqua, New York to process her emails, business as well as personal, when she was Secretary of State during President Barack Obama’s first term in office.
The server issue, first revealed in March 2015, now dogs her campaign, speaking not only to her tone-deafness, but, more deadly, to her judgment.
How could she not know that a Secretary of State will receive and may respond to classified information?
After the server became public knowledge, Clinton, as her husband has also done, resorted to legalisms: She hadn’t received or sent information on her server that was “marked classified at the time.”
Students of Hillary-speak immediately sensed something fishy.
The State Department, it turns out, has two email systems: one classified and one unclassified; and one kind of material can’t be sent on the other.
To avoid sending her classified information on her private server, her aides delivered it by other means – orally or in written summaries.
Thus, they weren’t “marked classified at the time.”
Yet State Department inspectors have found hundreds of emails that had been sent to her server that should have been classified.
An FBI investigation is underway.
Finally, what was supposed to be a huge asset for her candidacy – the prospect of making history as the first woman president – isn’t working out as she and her campaign had expected.
As in 2008, large numbers of women don’t want to be told that they must support Clinton simply because she’s a woman.
They find that an insult to their intelligence, and young women in particular are largely supporting Sanders; they prefer his platform and are troubled by questions about her integrity.
The only group of women that Clinton carried in New Hampshire, where Sanders beat her by 22 percentage points, was those over 65.
In the latest caucus, in Nevada, Clinton’s presumed advantage among non-white voters, who are a far greater factor in Nevada than in Iowa or New Hampshire, seems to have served her well, with Sanders failing to win enough African-American voters, in particular, to defeat her.
This augurs well for future nominating contests.
But the general election could be something else.

The Snap Election Trap
LONDON – The Conservative Party’s loss of its parliamentary majority in the United Kingdom’s snap election has proved political pundits, pollsters, and other prognosticators wrong once again.
And, once again, various explanations are being offered for an outcome that few expected.
For example, many have pointed out that Theresa May, the Conservative prime minister, campaigned poorly, and that pollsters’ models underestimated turnout by younger voters.
At the same time, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, managed to appear competent and confident.
But these explanations may all be irrelevant, because they focus strictly on how the campaign was conducted.
A better explanation comes from the field of psychology.
If pundits had paid attention to a well-established theory about the psychology of snap elections, they could have foreseen the UK election’s outcome.
According to research by New York University political scientist Alastair Smith, who has examined British general-election polling data and results dating back to 1945, decisions by prime ministers to hold an early election often backfire.
By holding an election three years ahead of schedule, May seems to have made a serious, though hardly unprecedented, miscalculation.
She assumed that the popular support she had when she announced the election would translate into actual votes.
Former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson made the same mistake in May 1970, when he tried to take advantage of Labour’s popularity.
During the ensuing campaign, Labour’s support collapsed, and the Conservatives ended up winning 330 of 630 seats.
Similarly, in 1997, former French President Jacques Chirac’s decision to call an early parliamentary election resulted in large electoral gains for opposition parties on the left.
The same thing happened in Australia in 1998.
In a 2003 study published in the British Journal of Political Science, Smith concluded that popular support for leaders who call early elections tends to wane in the run-up to the vote.
His analysis shows that the more popular a leader is when calling an early election, the more likely it is that he or she will lose support during the campaign.
When May called a snap election in April, she was riding so high in the polls that she and the Tories had expected to win in a landslide.
But as Smith argues, an early general election is a psychological poker game in which the electorate often calls a leader’s bluff.
May thought that she had a strong hand, because she has more information than the average voter about the country’s future prospects.
As prime minister, she has been fully briefed on the UK’s near-term economic conditions and the probable outcome of the Brexit negotiations with the European Union.
But, as Smith’s theory shows, May’s decision to hold an early election tipped her hand to voters, who probably suspected that she was exploiting her informational advantage to reinforce her own political position.
To illustrate this point, Smith uses the example of Margaret Thatcher, whose own strategy in the election poker game was the opposite of May’s.
In 1982, Thatcher was at the height of her popularity, having just declared victory in the Falklands War.
And while she was not required to call an election before May 1984, she could conceivably have parlayed her enormous popularity into another five-year term.
Public opinion polls from 1982 suggest that Thatcher almost surely would have won had she called an election that year.
Instead, she waited, despite the risk that future policy failures might erode her popularity.
How Thatcher assessed that risk depended on her own anticipated performance in the coming year.
If she was convinced that she would have effective solutions to problems that might emerge, then there was little risk in waiting to be tested at the polls.
On the other hand, if Thatcher had not been confident about her policies, she would have had a stronger incentive to cash in on her popularity by calling a snap election, lest she jeopardize her chances down the road.
Thatcher eventually called an election for June 1983.
Later, in their autobiographies, she and her chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, explained that their timing had been influenced by fears about inflation in the coming year.
By calling the election a year early, they avoided a scenario in which worsening inflation would have sapped the Conservatives’ popularity.
The key takeaway is that the timing of elections can reveal how well incumbents expect to perform in the future.
All else being equal, competent governments will wait longer before going to the electorate, whereas insecure leaders will try to capitalize on their popularity when they have it.
According to Smith’s theory, any leader who calls a snap election should expect to see his or her support decline, as has just occurred in Britain.
May has proved to be a far less confident leader than anyone had expected.
She led an uninspiring campaign in which her promise of “strong and stable leadership” rang hollow.
But her humiliating defeat could have been predicted before the campaign had even begun.

The Political Logic of China’s Strategic Mistakes
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Some of the Chinese government’s recent policies seem to make little practical sense, with its decision to impose a national-security law on Hong Kong being a prime example.
The law’s rushed enactment by China’s rubber-stamp National People’s Congress on June 30 effectively ends the “one country, two systems” model that has prevailed since 1997, when the city was returned from British to Chinese rule, and tensions between China and the West have increased sharply.
Hong Kong’s future as an international financial center is now in grave peril, while resistance by residents determined to defend their freedom will make the city even less stable.
Moreover, China’s latest move will help the United States to persuade wavering European allies to join its nascent anti-China coalition.
The long-term consequences for China are therefore likely to be dire.
It is tempting to see China’s major policy miscalculations as a consequence of over-concentration of power in the hands of President Xi Jinping: strongman rule inhibits internal debate and makes poor decisions more likely.
This argument is not necessarily wrong, but it omits a more important reason for the Chinese government’s self-destructive policies: the mindset of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
The CPC sees the world as, first and foremost, a jungle.
Having been shaped by its own bloody and brutal struggle for power against impossible odds between 1921-49, the party is firmly convinced that the world is a Hobbesian place where long-term survival depends solely on raw power.
When the balance of power is against it, the CPC must rely on cunning and caution to survive.
The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping aptly summarized this strategic realism with his foreign-policy dictum: “hide your strength and bide your time.”
So, when China pledged in the 1984 Joint Declaration with the United Kingdom to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy for 50 years after the 1997 handover, it was acting out of weakness rather than a belief in international law.
As the balance of power has since shifted in its favor, China has consistently been willing to break its earlier commitments when doing so serves its interests.
In addition to cracking down on Hong Kong, for example, China is attempting to solidify its claims in disputed areas of the South China Sea by building militarized artificial islands there.
The CPC’s worldview is also colored by a cynical belief in the power of greed.
Even before China became the world’s second-largest economy, the party was convinced that Western governments were mere lackeys of capitalist interests.
Although these countries might profess fealty to human rights and democracy, the CPC believed that they could not afford to lose access to the Chinese market – especially if their capitalist rivals stood to profit as a result.
Such cynicism now permeates China’s strategy of asserting full control over Hong Kong.
Chinese leaders expect the West’s anger at their actions to fade quickly, calculating that Western firms are too heavily vested in the city to let the perils of China’s police state be a deal breaker.
Even when the CPC knows that it will incur serious penalties for its actions, it has seldom flinched from taking measures – such as the crackdown on Hong Kong – deemed essential to maintaining its hold on power.
Western governments had expected that credible threats of sanctions against China would be a powerful deterrent to CPC aggression toward the city.
But judging by how China has thumbed its nose at the West, and especially at the US and President Donald Trump, this has obviously not been the case.
These Western threats do not lack credibility or substance: comprehensive sanctions encompassing travel, trade, technology transfers, and financial transactions could seriously undermine Hong Kong’s economic wellbeing and Chinese prestige.
But sanctions imposed on a dictatorship typically hurt the regime’s victims more than its leaders, thus reducing their deterrent value.
Until recently, the West’s acquiescence in the face of Chinese assertiveness appeared to have vindicated the CPC’s Hobbesian worldview.
Before the rise of Trumpism and the subsequent radical shift in US policy toward China, Chinese leaders had encountered practically no pushback, despite repeatedly overplaying their hand.
But in Trump and his national-security hawks, China finally has met its match.
Like their counterparts in Beijing, the US president and his senior advisers not only believe in the law of the jungle, but also are unafraid to wield raw power against their foes.
Unfortunately for the CPC, therefore, it now has to contend with a far more determined adversary.
Worse still, America’s willingness to absorb enormous short-term economic pain to gain a long-term strategic edge over China indicates that greed has lost its primacy.
In particular, the US strategy of “decoupling” – severing the dense web of Sino-American economic ties – has caught China totally by surprise, because no CPC leader ever imagined that the US government would be willing to write off the Chinese market in pursuit of broader geopolitical objectives.
For the first time since the end of the Cultural Revolution, the CPC faces a genuine existential threat, mainly because its mindset has led it to commit a series of calamitous strategic errors.
And its latest intervention in Hong Kong suggests that it has no intention of changing course.

Giving the Well-Performing State Its Due
MADRID – The triumph of democracy and market-based economics – the “End of History,” as the American political philosopher Francis Fukuyama famously called it – which was proclaimed to be inevitable with the fall of the Berlin Wall, soon proved to be little more than a mirage.
However, following China’s intellectual pirouette to maintain one-party rule while embracing the capitalist credo, history’s interpreters shifted their focus to the economy: not everybody would be free and elect their government, but capitalist prosperity would hold sway worldwide.
Now, however, the economic tumult shaking Europe, the erosion of the middle class in the West, and the growing social inequalities worldwide are undermining capitalism’s claim to universal triumph.
Hard questions are being asked: Is capitalism as we know it doomed?
Is the market no longer able to generate prosperity?
Is China’s brand of state capitalism an alternative and potentially victorious paradigm?
The pervasive soul-searching prompted by such questions has nurtured a growing recognition that capitalism’s success depends not only on macroeconomic policy or economic indicators.
It rests on a bedrock of good governance and the rule of law – in other words, a well-performing state.
The West overlooked the fundamental importance of this while it was fighting communism.
The standard bearers of the Cold War were not just the United States and the Soviet Union, but, in ideological terms, the individual and the collectivity.
When competing in newly independent or developing countries, this ideological opposition became Manichean, fostering a fierce suspicion, if not outright rejection, of rival principles.
As a result, strengthening state institutions was too often seen in the West as communist subterfuge, while the Soviet bloc viewed the slightest notion of individual freedom and responsibility as a stalking horse for capitalist counter-revolution.
Leading economists have long argued that the West’s greater reliance on markets resulted in faster and more robust economic growth.
But viewing the state and the market in terms of their inherent conflict no longer reflects reality (if it ever did).
Indeed, it is increasingly obvious that the threat to capitalism today emanates not from the state’s presence, but rather from its absence or inadequate performance.
Consider recent events in Argentina, which is facing certain economic losses as anxious investors have second thoughts about the country in the aftermath of the government’s nationalization of energy giant YPF.
That response is only logical, as investors seek the security of a well-functioning legal system to protect them from capricious political decisions.
Mexico provides further proof that the market alone is not enough.
An efficient judiciary and effective policing are necessary for capitalism to thrive.
In Brazil, the government is daring, for the first time, to address the lawlessness of the overcrowded favelas that ring the country’s large cities.
Or consider Ghana’s prosperity and how, like Brazil’s, it is going hand in hand with improved governance.
At the opposite extreme, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s undermining of his country’s institutions, prodding it onto a narco-state trajectory, places Venezuela alongside Haiti as an exception to Latin America’s recent economic success.
More generally, the world’s thriving countries are those with strong and effective institutions, backed by legal frameworks that guarantee the rule of law.
Latin America and Africa are not the only examples that prove the point.
The European Union’s internal problems, and its ongoing sovereign-debt crisis, are clearly linked to the weakness of its institutions, and, on Europe’s periphery, it still confronts feckless democracies.
Indeed, on Europe’s doorstep, the show trial and imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is jeopardizing her country’s international economic standing.
In particular, President Viktor Yanukovych’s contempt for the rule of law has put Ukraine’s relations with the European Union in cold storage, with a comprehensive free-trade and association agreement on hold pending the release of Tymoshenko and other political prisoners.
Meanwhile, political trials in Egypt are attracting international attention and deterring foreign investment.
In Asia, China is exposing the fallacy of looking at state capitalism as a competing alternative to liberal capitalism.
Approaching them as alternatives is, in fact, little more than an intellectual remnant of the Cold War, much like the concept of “state capitalism” itself.
With its remarkable ability to adapt, China is making strides to accommodate the rising power of its markets and people.
In the process, officials are acknowledging the importance of good governance, as demonstrated by recent efforts to justify the purge and investigation of Bo Xilai as an example of the Communist Party “safeguarding the rule of law.”
Adam Smith, that icon of market theory, argued that wealth is created when public institutions enable the “invisible hand” of the market to align interests.
The Cold War distorted that wisdom.
In a world free of that era’s ideological constraints, it is time to say loud and clear that the future of capitalism is linked to effective governance and the rule of law, and thus to the consolidation of well-functioning states.

Can Poor Countries Avoid a Vaccine Bidding War?
WASHINGTON, DC – The world has received the best possible gift for the coming year.
The development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in such a short time is something close to a medical miracle and portends an end to the crisis that dominated 2020.
But the pace at which we will end the pandemic depends on three factors.
The first is the extent of continued compliance with recommended safety measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, crowd avoidance, and hand washing.
The second factor is our ability to overcome the many logistical and distributional challenges of administering vaccines globally.
And the third is access to vaccines for poorer countries.
The pandemic will not be over until the coronavirus has been vanquished everywhere.
Some efforts are already underway to achieve this.
For example, COVAX, a coalition of 172 countries (not including the United States), is seeking “to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access” to vaccines “for people in all countries.”
Co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organization, it has already made arrangements with nine pharmaceutical developers to procure vaccines once they have been approved.
So far, the European Union and individual EU member states have contributed the most to the effort – €850 million ($1 billion) to date – followed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other major donors.
COVAX is seeking to raise $5 billion by the end of 2021 so that it can procure two billion doses.
But even with a vaccine requiring only one dose (the current approved vaccines require two), two billion would not be enough to cover the developing world’s population.
And while there is hope that producers in countries such as India can manufacture vaccines less expensively, the global supply will still fall far short of demand.
In addition to COVAX, there are also efforts to provide financing for poor countries directly.
The World Bank, for example, has committed $160 billion to its client countries, and many other donors and philanthropic foundations have contributed in a similar fashion.
Moreover, under the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund’s joint Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), 73 poor countries have been offered the opportunity to postpone debt-service payments until June 2021.
As of early December, 45 countries had signed up for the program, with most of them freeing up funds equivalent to 0.1-2% of GDP.
While universal access to the vaccine is essential to overcome the pandemic, it is not clear that allocating more money to poor countries for vaccine purchases will actually enable them to obtain more doses, given the anticipated supply issues.
Approved producers are already straining against capacity limits, and while there may be favorable surprises, increased demand (and thus the price at which the vaccine may be purchased) is unlikely to stimulate significantly higher production.
Moreover, many of the current contracts commit producers to sell at cost, with the quantities already specified.
After those stocks are depleted, additional financing to countries pursuing unilateral purchases would likely result in a bidding war, thereby driving up the price and offsetting the gains to overall welfare.
To be sure, the companies that undertook the risk of pursuing a safe and effective vaccine deserve to be compensated for their efforts.
As productive capacity increases, market forces should be allowed to provide incentives for innovation, development, and the creation of additional production facilities.
But given the extent of demand for vaccines in 2021 is likely to exceed supply, further incentives for additional production cannot be expected to improve the supply-demand balance within the year.
And that is hardly the only concern.
If some poor countries are sufficiently creditworthy, they may borrow more to finance vaccine purchases at the same time that the price for vaccines rises, leaving them with more debt but not a greater supply of vaccines than they otherwise might have procured.
Meanwhile, other poor countries that were already highly indebted are confronting debt-servicing difficulties that they would have faced even under normal economic circumstances.
And some of those receiving DSSI support may simply use the freed-up funds to finance debt-servicing commitments rather than to purchase vaccines.
To the extent that other creditors – such as private banks and major bilateral official lenders like China – get paid today, there will be fewer funds available later on for debt restructuring undertaken in conjunction with macroeconomic reforms.
These circumstances could result in there being fewer vaccines delivered to poor countries and greater rewards to creditors who received debt-service payments at the expense of those who offered DSSI forbearance.
And in still other cases, the newly available funds might be directed toward other areas of government deficit spending instead of to vaccine purchases.
Given all of these complications, the best way to help poor countries obtain more doses is to reach an international agreement, presumably through COVAX and the WHO, to coordinate the allocation of available vaccines.
The US is expected to rejoin the WHO after President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20.
Once that happens, a multilateral push to allocate vaccines efficiently to poor countries will have a high chance of success and should be pursued in earnest.

The Growth Engines Are Sputtering
CAMBRIDGE – The International Monetary Fund’s revised World Economic Outlook (WEO) is sobering.
It is rare for the organization to revise down sharply its projections for economic growth just one quarter into the calendar year. Yet in this case, it has done so for 86% of its 190 member countries, resulting in a decline of almost one percentage point in global growth for 2022 – from 4.4% to 3.6%.
Moreover, this forecast is accompanied by a significant increase in projected inflation, and all this bad news is packaged in a wrapping of deeper uncertainty.
There is a downward bias in the balance of risks, and inequality is expected to worsen both within and across countries.
The WEO revision is attracting a great deal of media attention. The focus, understandably, is on the relatively large size of the revisions for the current year, most of which are associated with the detrimental economic effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The war has disrupted the supply of corn, gas, metals, oil, and wheat, as well as pushing up the price of critical inputs such as fertilizer (which is made from natural gas).
These developments have prompted warnings of a looming global food crisis and a severe increase in world hunger.
Given the scale of the disruptions, it would not surprise me if the IMF issued a further downward revision to its growth projections – particularly for Europe – later this year.
But as important as these 2022 effects are, especially when it comes to the impact on vulnerable segments of the population and fragile countries, we also must pay attention to the IMF’s 2023 outlook.
The projection for next year points to a medium-term problem that is no less important: the lost potency of growth models worldwide.
The IMF does not expect its significant downward revision in global economic growth for 2022 to be offset in 2023. Instead, it has lowered its forecast for next year from 3.8% to 3.6%, with those revisions applying to both advanced and developing economies.
The implication is that the world’s economic engines are sputtering.
This problem is especially worrisome in such a fluid operating environment, because it means that the prevailing growth models are not up to the task of pulling economies through unanticipated negative shocks.
Making matters worse, the same models have also failed to maintain a decent level of inclusive growth during periods of less stress.
Three major secular developments are to blame for the tepid outlook: the changing nature of globalization; the prolonged reliance on artificial growth boosters; and the long-term failure to invest in the sources of sustained growth.
Economic and financial globalization have been evolving in ways that make it more difficult for national economies to leverage international trade and foreign direct investment for domestic growth.
While the pandemic raised questions about the proliferation and potential vulnerabilities of “just-in-time” cross-border supply chains, it is worth recalling that trade and investment restrictions were increasing well before COVID-19 emerged.
The US-China trade war featured the return of high tariffs and other protectionist measures that have generated far-reaching knock-on effects throughout the global economy.
Moreover, these developments have come at a time when many countries face tighter policy constraints.
A return to conventional and unconventional monetary-policy stimulus is now precluded by high and persistent inflation.
As the IMF notes, this new environment confronts central banks with very delicate and problematic policy tradeoffs, and it exposes the real economy to the potential vagaries of financial-market volatility.
Although the scope for fiscal action is less limited than it is for monetary measures, it is not well distributed among countries.
While governments should use the firepower they have to protect the most vulnerable segments of their populations, some already face troubling debt levels.
These developments coincide with a period of low productivity growth in many countries, which is a function of past and persistent failures to invest in the drivers of genuine growth, including physical infrastructure and human capital.
The IMF’s report offers an important reminder to policymakers that they need to focus much more attention on generating innovation, improving productivity, and strengthening the other drivers of robust, inclusive economic growth.
Failure to do so will make the risk of medium-term growth stagnation uncomfortably high.
In a world that is already subject to considerable climate, economic, financial, institutional, political, and social challenges, that is not a scenario we can afford.

Does Japan Vindicate Modern Monetary Theory?
TOKYO – The once-obscure school of macroeconomic thought known as Modern Monetary Theory has been attracting a lot of attention lately.
Some US progressives, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), and economists like James K. Galbraith, now advocate including MMT in the policy conversation, while others, including Kenneth Rogoff, dismiss it as problematic and even dangerous.
Building on Abba Lerner’s theory of functional finance, MMT essentially argues that countries that issue their own currencies can never run out of money in the way private businesses can.
For US progressives like AOC and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, this implies that the Federal Reserve could print large amounts of money to fund initiatives with major long-term benefits, such as a “job guarantee” program or public infrastructure projects.
Because the United States can borrow in its own currency, the logic goes, the surge in public-sector debt would not pose any real danger to the economy.
Some MMT advocates – including Stephanie Kelton, a former economic adviser to Sanders – point to Japan as proof that the approach works.
Despite high public debt, its economy is steadily recovering, and standards of living are high.
Moreover, MMT advocates point out, Japan’s expansionary monetary policies – a central feature of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-revitalization strategy, Abenomics – have not generated a much-feared surge in inflation.
Even within Japan, some argue that there is no need for a consumption-tax hike to fund public spending.
But there is a serious problem with this logic: Japan’s government is not as heavily indebted as is generally believed.
Though Japan’s gross debt-to-GDP ratio, at 240%, is the highest in the developed world, what really matters – for the government, just like for private firms – is the net debt-to-GDP ratio, which accounts for real and financial assets.
And Japan’s public companies have very large real assets.
In fact, by this measure, Japan is about on par with the US, and doing much better than France and Germany, according to the International Monetary Fund’s October 2018 Fiscal Monitor report, “Managing Public Wealth.”
Further challenging Kelton’s assessment, Japan’s primary balance has improved under Abenomics, thanks to its economic recovery.
This does not mean that MMT has no merit, in Japan or elsewhere.
In its campaign to increase consumption taxes, Japan’s Ministry of Finance drilled into the public psyche the concept of “Ricardian equivalence”: a government cannot stimulate consumer demand with debt-financed spending, because people assume that whatever is gained now will be offset by higher taxes due in the future.
(It was this campaign that drove the MOF constantly to advertise the 240% figure.)
MMT can challenge this strict Ricardian belief, drawing attention to the potential of deficit financing, say, to boost employment through targeted social spending.
And, indeed, Olivier Blanchard and Takeshi Tashiro have already proposed using limited deficit financing to help bring Japan’s interest rates up to zero, at a time when the government’s borrowing costs are low and the effectiveness of monetary policy is weak.
Implementing such a policy successfully, however, would demand careful attention to inflationary risks.
The current deflationary phase will not last forever.
Eventually, supply constraints will be reached, and inflation will return.
If the government has been engaging in excessive deficit-financed spending, once inflation is triggered, it could quickly spin out of control.
MMT lacks any safeguard against that outcome (unlike, for example, the fiscal theory of the price level, which expressly counts on an independent central bank to manage inflation).
In fact, supplying money with a constant nominal interest rate, as MMT seems to prescribe, would be the worst thing to do during an inflationary period, because the nominal market interest rate would probably be higher than the policy rate.
When discussing MMT, I cannot help but recall Goethe’s poem “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice.”
The sorcerer leaves his apprentice alone to carry out his chores.
Rather than perform his duties as expected, the apprentice decides to use the sorcerer’s magic, commanding a broom to carry buckets of water to fill a cauldron.
It helps for a while, in fact, for quite a long time, but eventually the cauldron begins to overflow, flooding the room, and the apprentice cannot get the broom to stop adding more water.
When he splits the broom with an axe, each piece becomes a new one, fetching water at twice the speed.
Just short of catastrophe, the sorcerer returns and sets the situation right.
Policymakers who recklessly implement MMT may find, like the sorcerer’s apprentice, that once the policies are set in motion, they will be difficult to stop.
And while a central bank can, with the requisite authority and independence, potentially step in to save the day, it is no all-powerful sorcerer.

Economists vs. Scientists on Long-Term Growth
CAMBRIDGE – Most economic forecasters have largely shrugged off recent advances in artificial intelligence (for example, the quantum leap demonstrated by DeepMind’s self-learning chess program last December), seeing little impact on longer-term trend growth.
Such pessimism is surely one of the reasons why real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates remain extremely low, even if the bellwether US ten-year bond rate has ticked up half a percentage point in the last few months.
If supply-side pessimism is appropriate, the recent massive tax and spending packages in the United States will likely do much more to raise inflation than to boost investment.
There are plenty of reasons to object to recent US fiscal policy, even if lowering the corporate-tax rate made sense (albeit not by the amount enacted).
Above all, we live in an era of rising inequality and falling income shares for labor relative to capital.
Governments need to do more, not less, to redistribute income and wealth.
It is hard to know what US President Donald Trump is thinking when he boasts that his policies will deliver up to 6% growth (unless he is talking about prices, not output!).
But if inflationary pressures do indeed materialize, current growth might last significantly longer than forecasters and markets believe.
In any case, the focus of economists’ pessimism is long-term growth.
Their stance is underpinned by the belief that advanced economies cannot hope to repeat the dynamism that the US enjoyed from 1995-2005 (and other advanced economies a bit later), much less the salad days of the 1950s and 1960s.
But the doubters ought to consider the fact that many scientists, across many disciplines, see things differently.
Young researchers, in particular, believe that advances in basic knowledge are coming as fast as ever, even if practical applications are taking a long time to develop.
Indeed, a small but influential cult touts the Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann’s “singularity” theory. Someday, thinking machines will become so sophisticated that they will be able to invent other machines without any human intervention, and suddenly technology will advance exponentially.
If so, perhaps we should be far more worried about the ethical and social implications of material growth that is faster than humans can spiritually absorb.
The angst over AI mostly focuses on inequality and the future of work.
But as science fiction writers have long warned us, the potential threats arising from the birth of silicon-based “life” forms are truly frightening.
It is hard to know who is right: neither economists nor scientists have a great track record when it comes to making long-term predictions.
But right now, and leaving aside the possibility of an existential battle between man and machine, it seems quite plausible to expect a significant pickup in productivity growth over the next five years.
Consider that the main components of economic growth are increases in the labor force, increases in investment (both public and private), and “productivity,” namely the output than can be produced with a given amount of inputs, thanks to new ideas.
Over the past 10-15 years, all three have been dismally low in the advanced economies.
Labor force growth has slowed sharply, owing to declining birth rates, with immigration failing to compensate even in pre-Trump America.
The influx of women into the labor force played a major role in boosting growth in the latter part of the twentieth century.
But now that has largely played out, although governments could do more to support female labor force participation and pay equity.
Similarly, global investment has collapsed since the 2008 financial crisis (though not in China), lowering potential growth.
And measured productivity growth has declined everywhere, falling roughly by half in the US since the tech boom of the mid-1990s.
No wonder global real interest rates are so low, with high post-crisis savings chasing a smaller supply of investment opportunities.
Still, the best bet is that AI and other new technologies will eventually come to have a much larger impact on growth than they have up to now.
It is well known that it can take a very long time for businesses to reimagine productive processes to exploit new technologies: railroads and electricity are two leading examples.
The pickup in global growth is likely to be a catalyst for change, creating incentives for firms to invest and introduce new technologies, some of which will substitute for labor, offsetting the slowdown in the growth of the workforce.
With the after-effects of the financial crisis fading, and AI perhaps starting to gain traction, trend US output growth can easily stay strong for the next several years (though, of course, a recession is also possible).
The likely corresponding rise in real global interest rates will be tricky for central bankers to navigate.
In the best case, they will be able to “ride the wave,” as Alan Greenspan famously did in the 1990s, though more inflation is likely this time.
The bottom line is that neither policymakers nor markets should be betting on the slow growth of the past decade carrying over to the next.
But that might not be entirely welcome news.
If the scientists are right, we may come to regret the growth we get.

The Double Threat to Liberal Democracy
CAMBRIDGE – The crisis of liberal democracy is roundly decried today.
Donald Trump’s presidency, the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, and the electoral rise of other populists in Europe have underscored the threat posed by “illiberal democracy” – a kind of authoritarian politics featuring popular elections but little respect for the rule of law or the rights of minorities.
But fewer analysts have noted that illiberal democracy – or populism – is not the only political threat. Liberal democracy is also being undermined by a tendency to emphasize “liberal” at the expense of “democracy.”
In this kind of politics, rulers are insulated from democratic accountability by a panoply of restraints that limit the range of policies they can deliver.
Bureaucratic bodies, autonomous regulators, and independent courts set policies, or they are imposed from outside by the rules of the global economy.
In his new and important book The People vs. Democracy, the political theorist Yascha Mounk calls this type of regime– in apt symmetry with illiberal democracy – “undemocratic liberalism”.
He notes that our political regimes have long stopped functioning like liberal democracies and increasingly look like undemocratic liberalism.
The European Union perhaps represents the apogee of this tendency.
The establishment of a single market and monetary unification in the absence of political integration has required delegation of policy to technocratic bodies such as the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the European Court of Justice.
Decision-making increasingly takes place at considerable distance from the public.
Even though Britain is not a member of the eurozone, the Brexiteers’ call to “take back control” captured the frustration many European voters feel.
The United States has experienced nothing quite like this, but similar trends have made many people feel disenfranchised.
As Mounk notes, policymaking is the province of an alphabet soup of regulatory bodies – from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Independent courts’ use of their prerogative of judicial review to promote civil rights, expand reproductive freedom, and introduce many other social reforms have encountered hostility among considerable segments of the population.
And the rules of the global economy, administered through international arrangements such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), are widely perceived as being rigged against ordinary workers.
The value of Mounk’s book is to highlight the importance of both of liberal democracy’s constitutive terms.
We need restraints on the exercise of political power to prevent majorities (or those in power) from riding roughshod over the rights of minorities (or those not in power).
But we also need public policy to be responsive and accountable to the preferences of the electorate.
Liberal democracy is inherently fragile because reconciling its terms does not produce a natural political equilibrium.
When elites have sufficient power, they have little interest in reflecting the preferences of the public at large.
When the masses mobilize and demand power, the resulting compromise with the elites rarely produces sustainable safeguards to protect the rights of those not represented at the bargaining table.
Thus, liberal democracy has a tendency to deteriorate into one or the other of its perversions – illiberal democracy or undemocratic liberalism.
In our paper “The Political Economy of Liberal Democracy,” Sharun Mukand and I discuss the underpinnings of liberal democracy in terms similar to those Mounk uses.
We emphasize that societies are divided by two potential cleavages: an identity split that separates a minority from the ethnic, religious, or ideological majority, and a wealth gap that pits the rich against the rest of society.
The depth and alignment of these divisions determine the likelihood of various political regimes.
The possibility of liberal democracy is always undercut by illiberal democracy at one end and what we call “liberal autocracy” at the other, depending on whether the majority or the elite retain the upper hand.
Our framework helps to highlight the fortuitous circumstances under which liberal democracy emerges.
In the West, liberalism preceded democracy: separation of powers, freedom of expression, and the rule of law were already in place before elites agreed to expand the franchise and submit to popular rule.
The “tyranny of the majority” remained a major concern for elites, and was countered in the US, for example, with an elaborate system of checks and balances, effectively paralyzing the executive for a long time.
Elsewhere, in the developing world, popular mobilization occurred in the absence of a liberal tradition or liberal practices.
Liberal democracy was rarely a sustainable outcome.
The only exceptions seem to be relatively egalitarian and highly homogeneous nation-states such as South Korea, where there are no obvious social, ideological, ethnic, or linguistic divisions for autocrats of either kind – illiberal or undemocratic – to exploit.
Today’s developments in Europe and the US suggest the vexing possibility that liberal democracy may have been a passing phase there as well.
As we rue liberal’s democracy’s crisis, let us not forget that illiberalism is not the only threat that confronts it.
We must find a way around the pitfalls of insufficient democracy as well.

A Universal Library
MELBOURNE – Scholars have long dreamed of a universal library containing everything that has ever been written.
Then, in 2004, Google announced that it would begin digitally scanning all the books held by five major research libraries.
Suddenly, the library of utopia seemed within reach.
Indeed, a digital universal library would be even better than any earlier thinker could have imagined, because every work would be available to everyone, everywhere, at all times.
And the library could include not only books and articles, but also paintings, music, films, and every other form of creative expression that can be captured in digital form.
But Google’s plan had a catch.
Most of the works held by those research libraries are still in copyright.
Google said that it would scan the entire book, irrespective of its copyright status, but that users searching for something in copyrighted books would be shown only a snippet.
This, it argued, was “fair use” – and thus permitted under copyright laws in the same way that one may quote a sentence or two from a book for the purpose of a review or discussion.
Publishers and authors disagreed, and some sued Google for breach of copyright, eventually agreeing to settle their claim in exchange for a share of Google’s revenue.
Last month, in a Manhattan court, Judge Denny Chin rejected that proposed settlement, in part because it would have given Google a de facto monopoly over the digital versions of so-called “orphan” books – that is, books that are still in copyright, but no longer in print, and whose copyright ownership is difficult to determine.
Chin held that the United States Congress, not a court, was the appropriate body to decide who should be entrusted with guardianship over orphan books, and on what terms.
He was surely right, at least in so far as we are considering matters within US jurisdiction.
These are large and important issues that affect not only authors, publishers, and Google, but anyone with an interest in the diffusion and availability of knowledge and culture.
So, while Chin’s decision is a temporary setback on the way to a universal library, it provides an opportunity to reconsider how the dream can best be realized.
The central issue is this: how can we make books and articles – not just snippets, but entire works – available to everyone, while preserving the rights of the works’ creators?
To answer that, of course, we need to decide what those rights are.
Just as inventors are given patents so that they can profit from their inventions for a limited time, so, too, authors were originally given copyright for a relatively short period – in the US, it was initially only 14 years from the first publication of the work.
For most authors, that would be enough time to earn the bulk of the income that they would ever receive from their writings; after that, the works would be in the public domain.
But corporations build fortunes on copyright, and repeatedly pushed Congress to extend it, to the point that in the US it now lasts for 70 years after the creator’s death.
(The 1998 legislation responsible for the last extension was nicknamed the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because it allowed the Walt Disney Company to retain copyright of its famous cartoon character.)
It is because copyright lasts so long that as many as three-quarters of all library books are “orphaned.”
This vast collection of knowledge, culture, and literary achievement is inaccessible to most people.
Digitizing it would make it available to anyone with Internet access.
As Peter Brantley, Director of Technology for the California Digital Library, has put it: “We have a moral imperative to reach out to our library shelves, grab the material that is orphaned, and set it on top of scanners.”
Robert Darnton, Director of the Harvard University Library, has proposed an alternative to Google’s plans: a digital public library, funded by a coalition of foundations, working in tandem with a coalition of research libraries.
Darnton’s plan falls short of a universal library, because works in print and in copyright would be excluded; but he believes that Congress might grant a non-commercial public library the right to digitize orphan books.
That would be a huge step in the right direction, but we should not give up the dream of a universal digital public library.
After all, books still in print are likely to be the ones that contain the most up-to-date information, and the ones that people most want to read.
Many European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand, have adopted legislation that creates a “public lending right” – that is, the government recognizes that enabling hundreds of people to read a single copy of a book provides a public good, but that doing so is likely to reduce sales of the book.
The universal public library could be allowed to digitize even works that are in print and in copyright, in exchange for fees paid to the publisher and author based on the number of times the digital version is read.
If we can put a man on the Moon and sequence the human genome, we should be able to devise something close to a universal digital public library.
At that point, we will face another moral imperative, one that will be even more difficult to fulfill: expanding Internet access beyond the less than 30% of the world’s population that currently has it.

Reversing the Pandemic's Education Losses
WASHINGTON, DC – As the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic approaches, classrooms remain fully or partially closed for as many as 647 million schoolchildren around the world.
Even where schools have reopened, many students continue to lag behind.
It is now abundantly and painfully clear that children have learned less during the pandemic.
According to World Bank estimates, pandemic-related school closures could drive up “learning poverty” – the share of 10-year-olds who cannot read a basic text – to around 70% in low- and middle-income countries. This learning loss could cost an entire generation of schoolchildren $17 trillion in lifetime earnings.
As the Omicron variant takes hold, more governments may be tempted to close schools.
Without the online infrastructure in place to support learning, doing so would extend the educational losses and deny children the many other benefits of daily school attendance, like the possibility to connect with classmates and develop social skills for personal growth.
Interactions with teachers and peers are essential to develop the abilities necessary to work collaboratively. Being part of a class promotes a sense of belonging and helps build self-esteem and empathy.
Throughout the pandemic, marginalized children have struggled the most.
When classrooms around the world reopened this fall, it became clear that these children had fallen even further behind their peers.
Before the pandemic, gender parity in education was improving. But school closures placed an estimated ten million more girls at risk of early marriage, which practically guarantees the end of their schooling.
Unless this regression is reversed, learning poverty and the associated human capital loss will hold economies and societies back for decades.
Children must be given a chance to recover the education they have lost.
They need access to well-designed reading materials, digital learning opportunities, and transformed education systems that help prepare them for future challenges.
Well-qualified teachers and effective use of technology are fundamental to this process.
Many countries have deployed massive stimulus packages in response to the health crisis.
But, as of June 2021, less than 3% of these funds was devoted to the education and training sector. And most of these resources were spent in advanced economies.
For many low-income countries, elevated debt-service payments crowd out essential social spending – including for education.
The resulting weakness in investments to support education and training threatens to deepen the disparities in learning outcomes that existed prior to the pandemic.
And while narrowing the education gap will require using resources more efficiently, the bottom line is that more resources are needed.
For the world’s poorest countries, in particular, an acceleration in debt relief under the G20’s Common Framework would provide fiscal space to increase support for human capital.
Investment in education must include funding for educational technology, taking into account what has worked well in different contexts around the world.
Uruguay is one of the success stories. Over the past ten years, the Uruguayan authorities have invested in infrastructure, digital content, and teacher capacity, leaving the country better prepared to shift to online schooling when classrooms closed.
Likewise, before the pandemic, the Indian state of Gujarat, betting on big data analysis and machine learning, set up state-of-the-art digital-support centers for schools. When schools closed, Gujarat was able to respond quickly by distributing material digitally and personalizing remote education to the learning level of each student.
And in Kenya, all children, including those with disabilities, can access specially designed and inclusive digital textbooks.
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank Group are working together to ensure that all education systems use technology effectively to close gaps and help reverse learning losses.
Embedding the use of technology within an overall strategy for ending learning poverty can help improve foundational skills, increase instructional time, and make the most efficient use of resources.
This is particularly critical in low-income countries, where technology can provide teachers with the support they need quickly.
Digital access can serve as a great equalizer.
Resources must be invested wisely, taking into account countries’ electricity infrastructure, internet connectivity, digitally enabled devices for the most disadvantaged students, and data-management and implementation capacity.
Without a carefully considered process to increase the use of technology, good intentions and well-designed policies will fail to achieve the recovery and acceleration of learning that developing countries need.
Access to quality education was uneven before the pandemic, and now it is even more so.
By investing in learning recovery and using technology wisely, it is possible to use the pandemic experience as a catalyst to improve education for all children.

Trump’s Diplomatic Deficit
DENVER – Connecting the strategic dots between Afghanistan, Syria, and North Korea has become an unavoidable task.
Only by doing so can the world begin to discern something resembling a coherent, if misguided, approach to US foreign policy by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Start with the military strike on the airfield in Syria from which a chemical attack was launched by Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
Was the barrage of Tomahawk missiles intended simply to send a message, as the Trump administration claims?
Does it suggest a more interventionist approach to Syria’s seemingly intractable civil war?
One might wonder if that strike indicates a more muscular foreign policy in general.
Shortly afterwards, the US military, having received “total authorization” for action from its commander-in-chief, dropped a massive ordinance air blast (MOAB) bomb – the largest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal – on Afghanistan.
The immediate goal was to destroy a tunnel network being used by the Islamic State.
The question is whether that is all the MOAB was meant for.
North Korea’s penchant for burying its military installations deep underground is well known.
Already, Trump has ordered a US Navy aircraft carrier group to sail to waters off the Korean Peninsula, amid rising tensions over the North’s nuclear and missile tests.
In this context, it seems that former President Barack Obama’s policy of “strategic patience” toward North Korea may be about to be replaced.
But while Trump is leaning on spectacular displays of hard power more than Obama did, he seems not to have settled on any overarching diplomatic approach.
After eagerly sending Obama’s diplomatic appointees packing on Inauguration Day, Trump has yet to fill key posts, including US ambassadors to South Korea, Japan, and China.
Whatever modicum of diplomacy there is – such as Trump’s recent summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping – seems to exist only to support military solutions.
It should be the other way around: military force should be used to support diplomacy.
As the Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz famously observed, war is a serious means to a serious end.
Consider the situation in Afghanistan.
The late Richard Holbrooke, arguably America’s greatest diplomat at the turn of this century, sought to negotiate with Taliban insurgents.
Though not all Afghan Taliban would be open to talks, he believed that enough of them could be engaged and pacified to weaken the most extreme factions.
His was a smart strategic approach that goes back to the Roman Empire: “divide and conquer.”
The US military under Trump, by contrast, dropped the “mother of all bombs.”
It may be that the Trump administration envisions a unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan, as the Obama administration once did.
Under Trump, however, the US may drop a few more MOABs on the way out.
The Trump administration seems to be aligning with its predecessor on another strategic goal: the removal of Syria’s Assad from power.
But what would come next?
Would the Sunni Islamists who comprise the majority of the opposition on the ground really just turn in their weapons, shrug off all that pesky extremism, and embrace life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness under a democratic government?
In any case, we may never find out, because Assad is still winning.
He has the support of powerful allies, including Russia and Iran, and the opposition is hopelessly divided.
Even the Free Syrian Army is really several armies that have little prospect of unifying – and even less hope of toppling the regime.
The most plausible option for ending the fighting in Syria is US engagement with global powers – including Assad’s allies – that agree on the need for a diplomatic settlement, based on power sharing and decentralization of government.
North Korea also suffers from an autocratic leader with no plans to go anywhere.
But, unlike Assad, Kim Jong-un could detonate another nuclear device any day now.
Yet here, too, there are constraints on what a military approach can achieve, though that didn’t stop Vice President Mike Pence from saying recently that "all options are on the table.”
For his part, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spent all of his time on the ground in South Korea last month with the US military commander there, rather than visiting with his own employees: the diplomats posted at the US embassy.
Senator Lindsey Graham has gone so far as to recommend launching a strike against North Korea now – before the regime can develop the missiles needed to deliver nuclear weapons to the US.
No matter, apparently, that the North can deliver them to its southern neighbor.
Graham considers himself a pragmatist; but there is nothing pragmatic about destroying the trust that underpins the US-South Korea alliance.
Few in the US seem to have Graham’s stomach for military action that would put 20 million South Koreans in imminent danger.
Some advocate making a deal with the Kim regime: a moratorium on weapons tests, in exchange for curtailment of US-South Korea military exercises.
But that approach would also weaken America’s critical alliance with the South – albeit less severely – while doing nothing to suppress the North’s appetite for nuclear weapons.
The circumstances in Syria, Afghanistan, and North Korea vary widely, but they have some things in common.
All represent serious foreign-policy challenges for the Trump administration.
And none can be resolved without comprehensive diplomatic strategies.
It is often said that 80% of life is just showing up.
In diplomacy, however, the key is following up, in order to transform senior policymakers’ overarching vision into a coherent strategy that gives structure to the day-to-day work of protecting the interests of the US and its allies around the world.
That is not something that the military can do alone.

Impotent America?
JERUSALEM – Israel’s 60th anniversary has come and gone.
So, too, has President George W. Bush’s final visit to the Middle East.
Amidst the celebrations and the soul-searching, no meaningful breakthrough in the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is visible.
There are immediate reasons why this is so: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s government is weak and unpopular, mainly due to the botched 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas is even weaker, having lost control of Gaza to Hamas after a violent putsch last year.
On the Palestinian side, this is part of a deeper phenomenon: a longstanding failure to create the institutional structures necessary for nation building.
For example, in 1936-1939, a Palestinian uprising against British rule deteriorated into a bloody civil war, in which more Palestinians were killed by their brethren than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces.
This is repeating itself now in Gaza.
Looking back at 60 years of American involvement in the region, one can discern two scenarios in which the United States can bring the local players to an agreement.
Absent these conditions, the US is ultimately powerless.
The first scenario is when a real war threatens to spill over into a wider conflict, destabilizing the region and Great Power relations.
At such times, resolute American steps can stop the fighting and impose a cease-fire, if not peace.
In 1973, at the end of the Yom Kippur War, Israel was poised to encircle the entire Egyptian Third Army in Sinai.
Its troops were on the road to Cairo, threatening to inflict a major defeat on Egypt.
Soviet intervention became a real threat.
A few tough messages from President Richard Nixon stopped the Israelis in their tracks and enabled the Americans to start a lengthy process of de-escalation that led to a number of interim agreements.
Likewise, in 1982, during the invasion of Lebanon, Israeli troops were about to enter Muslim West Beirut after Syrian agents assassinated the pro-Israeli Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
This would probably have brought Syria into the war.
A few tough calls from President Ronald Reagan to Prime Minister Menachem Begin prevented this.
During the first Gulf War in 1991, when Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israeli civilian targets and US forces failed to stop the Iraqi attacks, Israel was set to strike Iraqi targets, which would have split the US-Arab anti-Iraq coalition.
The US warned Israel not to get involved, and Israel was forced to comply.
In all these cases, American involvement was swift and focused on a clear aim, and compliance was verifiable within days, if not hours.
In such dramatic situations, US power is at its greatest.
The other scenario is when the two sides have already engaged in bilateral peace talks, paid the domestic political price, and reached agreement on most issues, though some matters remain unresolved and threaten to derail the process.
In such cases, America can step in and, by using both carrot and stick, make both sides go the extra mile.
After Anwar Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem in 1977, Israel and Egypt negotiated for a year and reached agreement on most issues: peace, diplomatic relations, and full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Egyptian territory in Sinai.
At this point, President Jimmy Carter – who initially opposed the process – invited both sides to Camp David to hammer out a peace treaty.
In 1993, in secret bilateral negotiations in Norway (unknown to the Americans), Israel and the PLO reached an agreement about mutual recognition and the creation of a provisional Palestinian Autonomous Authority.
Yet some issues remained unresolved.
President Bill Clinton stepped in, and prevailed upon the two sides to work out their remaining disagreements.
When either of these two scenarios is lacking, American initiatives are stillborn.
This happened to Clinton at Camp David in 2000, when he failed to bring Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to an agreement, and to Bush’s Road Map in 2003, when both sides agreed in principle to its general guidelines, but did little to implement them.
Absent local political will, and when confronted with a peace-making project that may take years to complete, the US is virtually powerless.
It is extremely successful as a fire brigade or as a midwife , but not as an initiator .
What applies to the US is even truer for the European Union, whose “soft power” is no match for its lack of local credibility.
The same dynamic can be seen elsewhere: for all its power, the US has failed to resolve the conflicts in Cyprus, Bosnia, or Kosovo.
The Annan Plan failed in Cyprus because of one party’s opposition; progress now (the minor but symbolically important opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia) reflects internal political changes on the Greek Cypriot side.
Similarly, if Belgrade will change its obstreperous position on Kosovo, this will be due not to US or EU pressure, but to internal political changes in Serbia.
Recognizing the limits of US power doesn’t mean that America is irrelevant: it can stabilize a conflict, help bring about confidence-building measures, and negotiate interim agreements.
But at the end of the day, in the case of Israel-Palestine, as in any conflict between two national movements, the key is in the hands of the local players.
No national conflict has ever been solved by outside powers, however well intentioned they may be.

Good Governance and Economic Performance
BERLIN – The debate about emerging countries’ growth prospects is now in full swing.
Pessimists stress the feared reversal of private capital flows, owing to the US Federal Reserve’s tapering of its purchases of long-term assets, as well as the difficulties of so-called second- and third-generation structural reforms and the limits to “catch up” growth outside of manufacturing.
Optimists argue that the potential for rapid growth remains immense, owing to better macroeconomic fundamentals and the promise of best-practice technology spreading throughout the emerging world.
So who is right?
Recent events point once again to the importance of good governance and responsive political systems, a familiar topic in studies of long-term economic growth.
Countries that appeared successful for a long time, such as Turkey or Thailand, suddenly seem to face obstacles related to governance and the ability to forge domestic political compromises.
The resulting divisiveness and dysfunction are surely bigger threats than the Fed’s tapering.
It is the nature of governance that determines whether people deploy their talents and energy in pursuit of innovation, production, and job creation, or in rent seeking and lobbying for political protection.
And here the contrast between Egypt and Tunisia may turn out to be an object lesson in what makes the difference between success and failure.
In Egypt, the old regime under Hosni Mubarak, having failed to democratize, collapsed in the face of massive protest.
A low-turnout election gave a plurality of the popular vote to the Muslim Brotherhood, which came to power alone and proceeded to ignore good governance and alienate all except its most fervent followers.
The Brotherhood’s approach to governance also explains the mess it made of the economy.
Instead of trying to build non-partisan and competent regulatory institutions, all positions were stacked with political followers.
Unfortunately, the military intervention last July gave rise to yet another regime that seems unable to build durable institutions that could foster political reconciliation and deliver inclusive growth.
Tunisia may give us an example of the opposite scenario: a real constitutional compromise supported by an overwhelming majority (reflected in a 200-16 vote in the National Constituent Assembly).
If that compromise holds, stability will take hold, markets will function, Tunisia will attract investment, and tourism will thrive again.
At the heart of the difference between the two cases is a vision of governance that makes such compromise possible.
Such a vision presupposes an assurance that a winner-take-all system will not be established, as well as broad agreement that regulatory institutions should be reasonably non-partisan and staffed with competent professionals.
China’s long-lasting success is sometimes given as a counterexample to the importance of good governance for economic performance.
The Chinese example certainly calls into question a strong correlation between multi-party democracy and economic growth.
Democracy is of course something valuable in itself and can be desired independently of its effect on economic growth.
But, in the context of economic performance, it is important to emphasize that there is a huge difference between dictatorial regimes, where a single individual monopolizes all power – à la Mubarak or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad – and China, where there has been competition and contestability within a large communist party.
And it is the party, operating as a fairly inclusive and meritocratic institution, not an autocratic leader, that has governed in the post-Mao period.
Lack of reasonably independent regulation and competent public administration – or, worse, one-person dictatorships – lead inexorably to economic waste and inefficiency, and eventually to political turmoil.
This is true even in cases like Venezuela, where large oil revenues masked the underlying weakness for a while.
In the complex global economy of the twenty-first century, sustained good economic performance requires a panoply of well-functioning institutions that do not fall within a single leader’s purview.
For example, successful economies require a reasonably independent central bank, and competent bank supervision that does not get dragged into short term politics.
They also need regulatory agencies in sectors such as telecommunications and energy that can pursue policies in accordance with broad goals established by the political process, but with appointees selected according to nonpartisan criteria who then exercise their authority in a way that fosters competition open to all.
When credit decisions, public procurement, construction contracts, and price determination reflect only short-term and purely political goals, good economic performance becomes impossible – even in countries with large natural-resource endowments.
In countries with little or no such endowments – where innovation, competitive efficiency, and a focus on production rather than rents is all the more important – the lack of good governance will lead to failure more rapidly.
All of this implies that analyzing the determinants of economic success is a subject not just for economists.
Why do some societies achieve the compromises needed to sustain an independent judiciary and a modern regulatory framework – both necessary for an efficient modern economy – while others perpetuate a partisan, winner-take-all approach to governance that weakens public policy and erodes private-sector confidence?
The contrast is starkest in emerging countries, but differences also exist among the advanced economies.
Perhaps Germany’s ability to reach sociopolitical compromise – again demonstrated by the formation of a right-left coalition after the 2013 elections – has been more fundamental to its recent economic success than the details of the fiscal and structural policies it has pursued to achieve it.

Monetary Order and International Security
PRINCETON – This year includes big anniversaries in the history of the international monetary order.
August 15 marked 50 years since US President Richard Nixon “closed the gold window”; and on September 21, it will have been 90 years since the British government took the pound off the gold standard.
Although both episodes belong to the history of money, their implications transcended the financial domain.
Each marked the passing of an entire international security regime.
The nineteenth-century global order had been built around British imperial power, with the gold standard serving as its financial foundation.
The gold standard was sustained by the expectation that even if it was suspended in times of war, the end of hostilities would allow the currency to return to its pre-war gold value.
That promise of a constant gold value provided an element of credibility that made it easier for a wartime government to borrow, and thus to bear the cost of the conflict.
Because the gold standard had long served as the financial underpinning of Britain’s imperial status, the country returned to it after World War I. But the cost proved to be too high.
By 1931, it was evident that a departure from gold was necessary to free up more room for the easy-money policies that would eventually drive the recovery from the Great Depression.
Britain also found after WWI that it could not easily reclaim its previous position at the center of the global security order.
Instead, it sought to preserve its influence through the creation of a new institution, the League of Nations.
To many Britons, this precursor to the United Nations looked like an improvement on the old balance-of-powers system.
It established a clear legal code for international behavior as well as limitations on “aggression.”
From the perspective of other countries, however, the League looked like a scheme designed to protect British interests on the cheap.
On September 18, 1931, a few days before the sterling was de-linked from gold, the Japanese army destroyed the League’s credibility as a bulwark against aggression.
By staging a false flag incident on the strategic railroad at Mukden (now the Chinese city of Shenyang), which it presented as a Chinese act of sabotage, Japan created a pretext for invading and seizing Manchuria.
The League was powerless in the face of these machinations.
The Japanese provocation merely underscored a point made by the League’s critics: aggression is a relative concept.
The “Nixon shock,” too, must be understood as part of a broader systemic change in the global security order.
It was the cost of America’s long failure in Vietnam, which strained the US budget and prompted a shift to inflationary financing that irked other countries.
America’s humiliation in Kabul today echoes these older moments of apparent imperial collapse.
Like the disintegration of the League’s order in the interwar world, and like the collapse of the American position in Vietnam, the Taliban’s reconquest of Afghanistan was not surprising.
In each case, the cataclysmic end was years in the making.
This is something that monetary and security collapses share.
Everyone can see the cracks in the system far ahead of time, but economic policymakers and security officials deny their intention of abandoning the status quo up until the final moment.
When the collapse comes, it is necessarily chaotic (because nobody could be seen to be preparing for it).
The dominant power’s credibility suddenly evaporates, and a rush to the exit – either from the currency or the country – soon follows.
The aftermath of these episodes can be even more chaotic still, as was the case in the interwar years.
One common characteristic of systemic collapse is that a whole network of alliances can be immediately discredited.
Hence, Afghanistan is a fiasco not just for the US administration but for every government associated with it.
Suddenly, it becomes much more likely that the old security system will be tested in ways that previously seemed unimaginable.
In the current case, all eyes will be on the Baltics and Taiwan.
These uncertainties create the need for a new, more viable and sustainable political order that is not dependent on the exhausted hegemon.
But it is foolish to think that there can (or should) be only one pole of global stability – as if it had to be the United States alone that took the mantle from the British in the twentieth century; or that it must be China that will assume the position vacated by the US today.
There are always other alternatives, and the tension between them is often a source of deep instability.
The hegemonic tussle between a revisionist Japan, Russia, and Germany during the interwar period is a case in point.
Moreover, new thinking can come from new players.
Nowadays, politics everywhere are being remade in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Contrary to what the pundits often suggest, it is far from clear that Russia or China inevitably will benefit from America’s humiliation.
India, for example, might come to play a greater role in Central and South Asian politics.
Similarly, with the United Kingdom gone, dynamics within the European Union are shifting.
France and Germany, the central axis of European politics for most of the post-war period, look increasingly tired and self-absorbed.
Both are heading into elections dominated by domestic issues – or in the case of Germany’s soporific campaign, no issues at all.
Meanwhile, Italy under Prime Minister Mario Draghi is producing new ideas and formulating a vision of how Europe can respond to global threats like the pandemic and climate change.
In looking for a new path forward, the essential message of 1931 and 1971 should be heeded.
Chaotic financial transitions are also security challenges.
Only by re-creating a viable system for managing interstate relations can financial stability be assured.
And stable international politics tend to be a prerequisite for establishing new financial orders.

The Economics of Violence
COPENHAGEN – What is the biggest source of violence in our world?
With the brutal conflicts in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere constantly in the news, many people would probably say war.
But that turns out to be spectacularly wrong.
Getting it right matters if we are to find cost-effective solutions to this and other global problems.
Obviously, everyone would like to stop wars and violence, just as we would like to end poverty, hunger, and global warming, while providing education to all.
But, given limited resources, the international community can only do so much.
We have to prioritize, which is what an economic analysis of costs and benefits can do.
The international community is working on new development goals for the next 15 years, and the Copenhagen Consensus has asked some of the world’s leading economists to give their assessment of the smartest targets they can choose.
Is reducing violence a goal worthy of resources that would otherwise be spent on, say, reducing hunger?
And, if so, which forms of violence should be targeted?
A study by James Fearon of Stanford University and Anke Hoeffler of Oxford University’s Center for the Study of African Economies argues that societal violence – homicides and especially violence against women and children – is a much bigger problem than civil wars.
Nine people are killed in interpersonal violence for every battlefield death in a civil war, and one child is killed for every two combatants who die.
In 2008, there were 418,000 homicides around the world, with far too many countries recording a murder rate of more than 10 per 100,000, which the World Health Organization regards as an epidemic.
A single homicide in America costs the individual and society $9.1 million.
If we scale this by national income across the world, this single category of violent crime costs 1.7% of global GDP.
Of course, this is not a direct financial loss to the global economy, but a way of expressing the impact.
If murders could be eliminated, societies around the world would be better off in ways that can be valued at 1.7% of GDP.
Compare this to the much lower cost of civil wars, which are equivalent to about 0.2% of global GDP.
But this is still much less than the biggest source of violence of all: violence against women in the home.
Based on studies published in Science, 28% of all women in Sub-Saharan Africa reported experiencing violence in the past year at the hands of their partners or family.
This includes women subjected to beatings, forced marriage at an early age, sexual assault, “honor” crimes, and female genital mutilation.
A conservative estimate puts the welfare cost of intimate partner violence alone at $4.4 trillion, or 5.2% of global GDP.
The second-largest source of violence is the abuse of children, 80% of which is inflicted by parents.
The definition of what constitutes child abuse varies by culture; but about 15% of children suffer each month from what the UN calls severe physical punishment.
This includes being slapped on the face, head, or ears, and a quarter of these children are beaten with some kind of implement repeatedly and as hard as possible.
Every month, some 290 million children endure such suffering.
The welfare cost is $3.6 trillion, or 4.2% of global GDP.
A tiny fraction of international aid funding currently goes toward reducing societal violence and improving criminal justice systems.
The enormous cost borne by society and individuals seems to cry out for action.
Unfortunately, there is still little hard evidence about where resources should best be focused.
All we can say is that the money spent to reduce violence might be better targeted.
Considerable amounts of aid are directed toward “fragile states” to help stop or prevent civil war, but only 0.27% of international aid goes to projects with a “crime prevention” component.
Other programs may help in indirect ways, but there obviously is much room for improvement.
Some solutions, it is clear, do work very well.
Stronger social services can reduce violence against children.
Studies in Washington State show that home visits from trained staff can reduce child abuse, improve children’s quality of life and physical and mental health, and reduce child-welfare and litigation costs.
A dollar spent on this program produces benefits of $14, making it a highly cost-effective policy.
In many cases, changes in social attitudes are needed.
To reduce violence against women and girls, one program in Uganda, called SASA!
(Kiswahili for “Now!”) promotes the view that partner violence is unacceptable, and has helped to halve the rate of it.
This is a fantastic outcome, of course, though there has been no analysis of how cost-effective it is.
There are other examples of countries taking effective action.
In 1993, Bogota suffered 80 murders per 100,000 people.
By taking an integrated approach – limiting the hours during which alcohol can be sold, reclaiming public space, and improving the police and justice systems – the homicide rate was reduced to 21 per 100,000 in 2004.
That is still high, but it is far below the rate of 55 per 100,000 in Detroit.
Alcohol is a factor in many assaults, and controlling its availability could have a significant part to play, as the findings in Bogota suggest.
In the United Kingdom, a pilot study on stronger enforcement of existing rules showed that assaults could be reduced in a very cost-effective way, with the benefits outweighing the costs by 17 to one.
While we still don’t know enough, two points are certain.
First, domestic violence against women and children imposes a social cost of $8 trillion each year, making it a huge – and vastly underreported – global issue.
Second, there are solutions that can help to tackle some of these problems very cost-effectively.
That is why reducing domestic violence belongs on the short-list for the world’s next set of development goals.

The Stock-Bond Disconnect
CAMBRIDGE – How should one understand the disconnect between the new highs reached by global equity indices and the new depths plumbed by real interest rates worldwide?
Several competing explanations attempt to reconcile these trends, and getting it right is essential for calibrating monetary and fiscal policy appropriately.
The most popular explanations downplay risk factors in a way that can be dangerously misleading.
For example, the “secular stagnation" theory claims that low interest rates tell the true story.
The global economy is suffering from a chronic demand shortfall, which can be remedied through sustained growth in government spending.
According to this view, soaring stock markets merely reflect low discounting of future profits.
Moreover, labor's share of profits seems to have fallen markedly in recent decades across the world's eight largest economies, with the possible exception of the United Kingdom.
Conversely, capital's share of profits has been rising, which of course raises the value of equities (though, stock prices have continued to rise in countries like the US and the UK where labor shares have begun at least a cyclical recovery, and where interest-rate hikes may soon be on the horizon).
Proponents of secular stagnation argue that government spending as a share of GDP, which has more than doubled in most advanced economies since the 1950s, should continue to rise.
Although one can readily agree that high-yielding government investments in education and infrastructure are especially justified today, the idea that demand permanently constrains supply in a significant way is dubious.
More refined studies of the recent recession suggest that the lasting so-called “hysteresis" effects on unemployment have been limited, at least in the US.
Another possible explanation of low interest rates is financial repression.
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, like the Federal Reserve before them, are gluttonously buying bonds.
At the same time, a host of new regulations to promote financial stability are forcing banks, pension funds, and insurance companies to stock up on government securities.
Thus, today's low interest rates are more a reflection of distortions in financial markets than of low growth expectations.
Proponents of the financial repression explanation essentially view low interest rates as a hidden tax on bondholders, who receive a lower interest rate than they would otherwise.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, given that all taxes are distorting, and that there really is no way to deal with today's outsize debt burdens that does not impinge on growth in some way.
But the financial repression tax is not nearly as progressive as a more general wealth tax would be, because lower-income households typically have a smaller share of their assets in equities.
In any event, it is unclear how financial repression can be the whole story.
The fall in bond yields has extended to a far broader range of debt than just government paper.
Other factors are contributing to today's ultra-low interest-rate environment as well.
Adverse demographics and declining labor-supply growth in most advanced economies are undeniably important.
The puzzle, though, is that this trend has played out in a very gradual and predictable way, whereas the decline in interest rates has been more rapid and somewhat unexpected (certainly by central banks).
And it is difficult to argue that weak demographics is the main driver of strong stock prices, though some have tried.
Curiously, heightened risk and fears of further disruptions – not just another financial crisis, but also geopolitical instability and pandemics – do not seem to carry much weight in current policy discussions, though the idea has been around.
Though bonds are hardly a perfect hedge against such risks, they typically beat stocks (except, perhaps, in cases of global conflagration, when both fare badly).
In recent work with Carmen and Vincent Reinhart, we show that even relatively minor shifts in disaster risk – say, a rise from a normal 2-3% to 3-4% – can lead to a massive decline in global real interest rates, even taking them well into negative territory.
This can be the case even if expected growth is strong.
But the policy implications of this are not straightforward.
If the government has superior information and analysis, and correctly assesses that public fear is not justified, then of course it makes sense to take advantage of the information – by issuing more debt, for example.
If, on the other hand, the public is basically right about heightened disaster risks, the policy issues become much more complex.
The problem is that the government likely faces high costs if a disaster strikes, which implies a high option value to preserving fiscal space for when it is most needed.
The idea that hyper-low interest rates are merely symptoms of deficient demand or financial repression is dangerously simplistic.
Surely heightened public concern about the risk of future economic catastrophe in the wake of the financial crisis is still playing an important role, reinforced by lingering fragility in the eurozone and rising instability in emerging markets.
This makes the public understandably more cautious.
But if the risks that might help explain the price trends for stocks and bonds are real, policymakers, too, should be careful not to throw caution to the wind.

Recession Geopolitics
FLORENCE – The news that China has overtaken Japan as the world’s second largest economy did not come as a surprise.
This is the major geo-political outcome of the Great Recession of the early twenty-first century – one that carries both economic hope and political fear.
First, the good news: the economic side of the case.China’s response of to the world economic crisis is the central reason why the financial turbulence that emanated from the US sub-prime debacle did not completely destroy the world economy and lead to a repeat of the 1930’s Great Depression.
In a famous analysis of the Great Depression, the economic historian Charles Kindleberger argued that it arose from a failure of world leadership.
Great Britain had been the hegemonic power of the nineteenth century, but its creditor status had been severely eroded by the cost of fighting World War I.
The United States had emerged from the war as the world’s largest creditor, but it had a double vulnerability. Its financial system was unstable and prone to panics, and its political system was immature and prone to populism and nativism.
In the Depression, according to Kindleberger, the US should have provided an open market to foreign goods. Instead, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act closed off American markets and provoked other countries into a spiral of retaliatory trade measures.
US financial institutions should have continued to lend to distressed borrowers, in order to prevent a spiral in which credit rationing forced price reductions and intensified world deflation.
Instead, US banks, widely blamed for the international lending boom that preceded the bust, were so intimidated and weakened that the flow of American credit stopped.
After World War II, as a leading figure in developing the Marshall Plan, Kindleberger set about applying these lessons: the US should keep its markets and its flow of funds open to support other countries.
How different the twenty-first century looks!
It is as if China’s leaders were the star pupils in one of Kindleberger’s courses.
Throughout the crisis, the Chinese economy continued to grow at an amazing pace, in part as a consequence of massive fiscal stimulus.
When anyone wants an example of how effective a Keynesian counter-cyclical strategy can be, internationally as well as domestically, they need look no further than China’s four-trillion-renminbi stimulus of 2008-2009.
Apart from a six-month period after the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, in which trade finance stopped and the world did look as if it was close to Great Depression circumstances, China and other emerging markets helped those export-oriented industrial economies to recover.
The surprising strength of the German economy, with more vigorous growth than at any time in the past 15 years, is due to the dynamism of emerging-market – particularly Chinese – demand, not only for investment goods, engineering products, and machine tools, but also for luxury consumer products.
Germany’s high-end automobile producers are now operating at full capacity.
China also followed Kindleberger’s financial lessons. For a moment, it looked as if a contagious crisis, driven by fears of government over-indebtedness, would destroy the politically fragile compromise that European countries had carefully constructed over a 50-year period.
The turning point in this spring’s euro panic came when big holders of reserve currencies signaled that they saw the need for the euro as an alternative to the increasingly problematic dollar and the equally vulnerable yen.
China started to buy European Union governments’ bonds, and a high-profile Chinese team even went to Greece to buy under-priced real assets.
It was not just Europe that benefited from China’s willingness to take on the mantle of “lender of last resort.”
The new-found dynamism of African economies is a consequence of the Chinese drive to build up and secure sources of raw materials.
But there is a problem with Kindleberger’s argument.
Kindleberger, a kind and well-meaning man, could never see that the world is never entirely grateful to the country that saves it.
Being a hegemon is a thankless task.
The beneficent effects of China’s engagement in the world economy are felt much more powerfully farther away from China.
In that sense, too, there is a parallel with the story of the US, whose leadership was felt much more positively in Europe than it was in Canada, Mexico, or Central America.
It is not surprising that the greatest and strongest ideological opponent of the American way of life was not in distant Europe or Asia, but in Cuba, just 90 miles off the Florida coast.
Since the early twentieth century, Mexicans have felt worried and threatened by American strength.
And, in the same way, Taiwan and Vietnam feel that they will be the Chinese giant’s first victims.
The global hegemon has never been loved by its neighbors.
But the US gradually, if imperfectly, built up trust through multilateral institutions.
Europeans did much better at reconciliation with their neighbors after WWII, in part because the malign and evil conditions of Nazi rule made it necessary to talk about the past in terms of moral categories rather than power politics.
In contrast to America’s engagement in multilateralism, or Europe’s search for reconciliation through a plethora of common institutions, power politics is much more a part of Asia’s twentieth-century legacy.
The real challenge for China’s leaders will be to develop a coherent view of the world that does not scare the people just across the border.

One Hundred Years of Tranquility?
SANTIAGO – Gabriel García Márquez’s great novel One Hundred Years of Solitude starts with a colonel who “started 32 civil wars and lost them all” facing the firing squad.
The site of the event is the fictional town of Macondo, but few readers are fooled: the novel is about García Márquez’s native Colombia.
Last week, Colombia’s civil war – the sole remaining armed conflict in Latin America – formally came to an end.
It lasted more than 50 years, cost a quarter-million lives, and displaced six million people.
It seems hard to believe, but peace is finally here.
Pessimists will point out that much remains to be worked out, fighters have yet to hand in their weapons, and the final peace agreement has not been signed.
Still, the handshake in Havana between President Juan Manuel Santos and guerrilla leader Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri (known by the nom de guerre Timochenko) marks the end of a tragic era and the beginning of a far more promising one.
Beginning in the 1960s, Latin America was infected by a bad case of what Lenin called “Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder.”
Donning fatigues and taking to the mountains was the cure for all social ills.
Guerrilla movements were born and grew, often only to split up and engender new ones.
In many places – especially Central America – violent insurgency became endemic.
Colombia’s bloodshed started even earlier, in the period simply known as “The Violence,” following the murder in 1948 of the liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán.
The fighting between liberals and conservatives came to an end with the advent of the bloody dictatorship of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in 1953.
Democracy of sorts returned in 1958, but violence continued – until now.
Of course, the poster child for the period of revolutionary fervor in Latin America was the Cuban revolution of 1958.
Che Guevara’s intense gaze and red-starred beret, captured in Alberto Korda’s iconic photograph, mobilized a generation.
Nearly six decades later, the dream of the Cuban revolution lies in tatters.
Its once-proud leader, Fidel Castro, has become a pathetic figure, clad in garish tracksuits, appearing from time to time to utter increasingly incoherent pronouncements.
His brother and handpicked successor, Raúl, as grey and uninspiring as political leaders come, hosted this week’s peace ceremony in Havana.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the counterpart of childish revolution from the left was murderous repression from the right.
Dictatorships proliferated, from Brazil and Argentina to Uruguay and Chile, all the way to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in Central America.
They, too, made promises, theirs based on law and order and orthodox economic management.
Today in Latin America only a lunatic fringe believes such promises.
When the going gets tough, no one turns to the military barracks anymore.
As former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso pointed out recently, in the midst of his country’s political crisis everyone now knows the names of prosecuting judges, but no one knows the names of leading generals.
That is progress, however hard earned.
Aside from Cuba, the saddest reminder of Latin America’s tragic mistakes of the past is Venezuela.
The country, ruled since 1999 by populist Hugo Chávez and his successor Nicolas Máduro, has gone from a political crisis to a full-fledged humanitarian disaster, with no food in stores or medicines in clinics.
The Financial Times reports that, according to the Venezuelan National Assembly, “17 years of chavismo have seen more than $425 billion of public money stolen or wasted.”
No one knows how, but with the Colombian tragedy over, the Venezuelan tragedy seems destined to end sooner rather than later.
Chavismo today inspires no one.
The copycat regimes it spawned around Latin America are gone or severely weakened.
Just as Europe, post-Brexit, seems to be moving toward nationalism and populism, Latin America is heading in the opposite direction.
With any luck, the era of the mountain guerrilla, the irate demagogue in green fatigues, or the frightful general in dark glasses is over in the Americas.
What comes next is the era of the prudent politician in a boring blue suit who acknowledges that hard problems have no easy solutions, and who spurns towering promises in favor of Churchillian sweat and toil.
We may finally be growing up politically.
Santos himself in Colombia, Mauricio Macri in Argentina, and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in Peru are emblematic of this new period.
They are all capable managers and highly trained technocrats.
Steering the economy forward without populism – and the inflation and fiscal crisis that always go with it – is their principal challenge and possibly will be their most publicized achievement.
But they should not rely on technocratic prowess alone as the key to legitimacy and political success.
Today’s Latin Americans have grown disenchanted with vain revolutionary promises, but they also look at their liberal democratic institutions – and the people who lead them – with a skeptical eye.
This is understandable in a region where income inequality, unresponsive bureaucracy, and opaque businesses practices are still very much a feature of everyday life.
In Europe and Latin America, voters today need to feel that their leaders’ hearts are in the right place, and that they are acting on behalf of everyone, including the underprivileged, not merely serving a rich elite.
The ultimate goals of sound policy are ethical, and they ought to be described in those terms.
When a leader mismanages a middle-income economy so terribly that people go hungry –as Chávez and Maduro have done in Venezuela – that is an immoral act.
Hunger causes avoidable human suffering, a clear moral wrong.
Seeking consensus, avoiding demagoguery, pursuing incremental and, therefore, sustainable solutions – none of that sounds terribly epic, but it is profoundly moral.
If democratic leaders in Latin America can get that message across, then the era inaugurated by the Colombian peace agreement will be a long and happy one.

Talent versus Capital in the Twenty-First Century
GENEVA – When financial policymakers attempt to promote economic growth, they almost invariably focus on looking for new ways to unleash capital.
But, although this approach may have worked in the past, it risks giving short shrift to the role that talent plays in generating and realizing the ideas that make growth possible.
Indeed, in a future of rapid technological change and widespread automation, the determining factor – or crippling limit – to innovation, competiveness, and growth is less likely to be the availability of capital than the existence of a skilled workforce.
Geopolitical, demographic, and economic forces are relentlessly reshaping labor markets.
Technology, in particular, is changing the nature of work itself, rendering entire sectors and occupations obsolete, while creating completely new industries and job categories.
By some estimates, almost half of today’s professions could be automatable by 2025.
Speculation about what will replace them ranges from predictions of unexpected opportunities to forecasts of large-scale unemployment as machines displace most human labor.
The first signs of this disruption are already visible.
Global unemployment has topped 212 million, according to the International Labor Organization, and another 42 million new jobs will need to be created each year if the world economy is to provide employment to the growing number of new entrants into the labor market.
Meanwhile, last year, 36% of employers worldwide reported facing difficulties in finding talent, the highest percentage in seven years.
Addressing this mismatch in supply and demand will require governments, business leaders, educational institutions, and individuals to overcome incentives to focus on the short term and begin to plan for a future in which change is the only constant.
All must rethink what it means to learn, the nature of work, and the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in ensuring that workers around the world are able to fulfill their potential.
Human-resource executives at some of the world’s largest companies anticipate profound disruptions from the increased adoption of mobile Internet and cloud technology, the use of big data, flexible work arrangements, 3-D printing, advanced materials, and new energy supplies, according to early results from a survey by the World Economic Forum.
Their view of the overall impact on employment levels in their industries was for the most part positive – provided that new workforce skills can be developed rapidly in their own sectors and in the labor market more broadly.
As technology increasingly takes over knowledge-based work, the cognitive skills that are central to today’s education systems will remain important; but behavioral and non-cognitive skills necessary for collaboration, innovation, and problem solving will become essential as well.
Today’s schools and universities, which are dominated by approaches to learning that are fundamentally individualistic and competitive in nature, must be redesigned to focus on learning to learn and acquiring the skills needed to collaborate with others.
Uniquely human skills, like being able to work in teams, manage relationships, and understand cultural sensitivities will become vital for businesses across all sectors and must become a core component of future generations’ education.
Moreover, with education increasingly becoming a lifelong pursuit, businesses must rethink their role in providing for a competitive workforce.
Some companies have already grasped this and are investing in their employees’ continuous learning, re-skilling, and up-skilling.
Yet most employers still expect to obtain pre-trained talent from schools, universities, and other companies.
Business will increasingly have to work with educators and governments to help education systems keep up with the needs of the labor market.
Given rapid change in the skill sets required for many occupations, business must redirect investment to on-the-job training and lifelong learning, particularly as millennials enter the workforce, seeking purpose and diversity of experience where their predecessors sought remuneration and stability.
Business cycles naturally entail peaks and troughs in employment, and socially responsible businesses should follow successful examples like Coca-Cola, Alcoa, Saudi Aramco, Africa Rainbow Minerals, and Google in working toward mitigating joblessness and enhancing people’s abilities to earn a livelihood.
Governments, too, have a role to play in creating an environment in which their citizens can reach their potential.
Policymakers must use stronger metrics to assess human capital and reexamine investment in education, curriculum design, hiring and firing practices, women’s integration into the workforce, retirement policies, immigration legislation, and welfare policies. Regulatory support for entrepreneurship and small and medium-size enterprises remains one of the most underused means of unleashing creativity, enhancing growth, and generating employment.
Protecting workers and consumers is critical, but shielding specific industries from the impact of new business models will not hold off the next wave of transformation.
Rather than seeking to rein in disruptive businesses such as Airbnb and Uber, governments should introduce regulations that enable their sustained growth, while looking for ways to leverage their technologies and entrepreneurial approaches to boost social welfare.
Such policies include online education courses for the unemployed, digital workers’ insurance, virtual unionization, and tax policies geared for the sharing economy.
Unlocking the world’s latent talent, and thus its full capacity for growth, requires us to look beyond business cycles and quarterly reports.
The future is full of potential, but only if we are smart enough – and courageous enough – to grasp it.

Now is Our Time
New York – Every September, the world’s leaders gather at the United Nations to reaffirm our founding Charter – our faith in fundamental principles of peace, justice, human rights, and equal opportunity for all.
We assess the state of the world, engage key issues of the day, and lay out our vision for the way ahead.
But this year is different.
The 64th opening of the General Assembly asks us to rise to an exceptional moment.
We are facing many crises – food, energy, recession, and pandemic flu – occurring all at once.
If ever there were a time to act in a spirit of renewed multilateralism, a time to put the “united” back into the United Nations, it is now.
And that is what we are doing, as action on three issues of historic consequence demonstrates.
First, world leaders are uniting to address the greatest challenge we face as a human family – the threat of catastrophic climate change.
Last week, 101 leaders from 163 countries met to chart the next steps toward December’s all-important UN climate change conference in Copenhagen.
They recognized the need for an agreement that all nations can embrace – in line with their capabilities, consistent with what science requires, and grounded in “green jobs” and “green growth,” the lifeline of a twenty-first century global economy.
We at the UN have prepared carefully for this moment.
For two and a half years, ever since I became Secretary-General, we have worked to put climate change at the top of the global agenda.
Today, we have entered a new phase.
Last week’s summit sharply defined the issue and focused attention in capitals the world over.
To be sure, the issues are complex and difficult, especially those of financing adaptation and mitigation efforts in poorer countries.
Yet leaders left New York committed to clear and firm instructions for their negotiators: seal a deal in Copenhagen.
Japan issued a challenge, agreeing to cut CO2 emissions by 25% by 2020 if other nations follow.
China’s President Hu Jintao spoke about all that his country is already doing to reduce energy intensity and invest in “green” alternatives.
He emphasized that China is prepared to do more under an international agreement, as did US President Barack Obama.
Negotiators will gather for another round of UN talks on September 28 in Bangkok, and we are considering a smaller meeting of major emitting and most vulnerable nations in November.
We need a breakthrough in this make-or-break year.
We saw another turning point on a second issue of existential importance: nuclear disarmament.
Finally, the assumption that such weapons are needed to keep the peace is crumbling.
At a special summit called by the President Obama, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that opens a new chapter in the UN’s efforts to address nuclear proliferation and disarmament.
That resolution improves prospects for expanding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty next May, and offers hope for bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into force.
It also sets establishes the contours of a legal framework for action against misuse of civilian nuclear technology for military purposes and reflects an emerging consensus, seen in meeting after meeting, that the time has come to increase pressure on countries that fail to respect these principles.
The world is united on a third front, as well.
Though some may speak of “turning the corner to recovery,” we see a new crisis emerging.
According to our recent report, “Voices of the Vulnerable,” the near-poor are becoming the new poor.
An estimated 100 million people could fall below the poverty line this year.
Markets may be bouncing back, but jobs and incomes are not.
That is why, earlier this year, the UN put forward a Global Jobs Pact for balanced and sustainable growth.
It is also why we are creating a new Global Impact Vulnerability Alert System, giving us real-time data and analysis on socio-economic conditions around the world.
We need to know precisely who is being hurt by the financial crisis, and where, so that we can best respond.
That is also why, next year at this time, we will convene a special summit on the Millennium Development Goals.
We have only five years to meet the targets for health, education, and human security that we set for 2015.
At the various G-20 summits over the past year, including the latest in Pittsburg, the UN has stood firm to speak and act for all those being left behind.
Rhetoric has always been abundant at the General Assembly, action sometimes less so.
Yet listening to the world’s leaders speak, last week, I was struck by their passion, commitment, and collective determination to turn a page from a past of countries divided by narrow interests to nations united in the cause of a global common good.
From confronting climate change to creating a world without nuclear weapons to building a more equitable and sustainable global economy, I saw a sprit of renewed multilateralism, with the UN at the fore.
No country can deal with any of these challenges by itself.
But as nations united, the United Nations can.

Germany’s Zero Hour
The 8th of May always brings back memories of 1945, because for me the end of the war in Europe really was a zero hour.
When the first Soviet soldiers came up our little street in the Western suburbs of Berlin, we knew that the great slaughter was coming to an end.
My father who had been in the resistance would come back from Brandenburg prison.
I no longer needed to hide as I had done after my release from a Gestapo camp at the beginning of February.
Somehow a new life would begin.
First, however, was the chaos.
The Nazis were gone, and the occupation powers had not yet set up any kind of administration.
We all went looting the local shops; I still have the slim volumes of romantic poetry which my 16-year-old self took from a bookshop.
The occupation troops went on a rampage. Food was hard to find.
My father was taken from prison and transported straight to central Berlin, where he was told to set up the office for Berlin’s energy supply, a task that had to be done literally from nothing.
There was no power, no transport, no organised life of any kind for a period.
Was it defeat or liberation?
For Germans this question was not easily answered, though clearly our family was liberated in every sense.
The question then was this: liberated for what?
Where do we go from here?
“You must help,” my mother said to me.
So I offered my services to the local Soviet authority and helped distribute basic foodstuffs to a small number of outlets in our district of Zehlendorf.
Five weeks later, however, I was back at school.
I carried a special pass as a “victim of fascism,” but others showed their Iron Cross which they had got for late military action.
Some were refugees from the East, many had their homes destroyed in air raids, almost all grieved for lost loved ones.
Yet the zero hour did not last.
It is almost unbelievable, but three years later the liberalising policies that followed a currency reform set in motion what came to be known as Germany’s economic miracle.
To be precise: this is how West Germany’s economic miracle began.
The German example shows just how different occupation powers can be.
In the Soviet zone of occupation, progress was slow and above all coupled with a new enslavement.
Even concentration camps like Buchenwald changed their guards and inmates but remained in use.
The Western powers in Germany, on the other hand, pursued, after a short period of non-fraternisation, a policy of controlled empowerment.
Within a year of the end of the war there were indigenous administrations, within two years elections.
Democracy was not just preached but practised, and it could build on German traditions.
All this, to be sure, was not just benevolence on the part of the occupying powers. It was also a result of the incipient Cold War, and the desire of both sides to consolidate “their” part of Germany.
Even so, there are lessons to be learned from the process.
Two of these deserve to be mentioned.
One is economic and has to do with the Marshall Plan.
It is perhaps regrettable but nonetheless real that democracy finds roots more easily if economic conditions improve.
Such improvement requires above all self-help, the actions of individuals who will not accept the misery of the zero hour for long.
Such self-help can be encouraged by policies (which is what Ludwig Erhard, the father of the “social market economy” did in Germany), but some starting capital helps.
This is where the Marshall Plan of American support became crucial.
Similarly, the European Union has helped, and continues to help the postcommunist countries on their way.
The other lesson is moral, and it is more difficult.
The Nuremberg trials exposed the guilt of the Nazi leaders beyond doubt, if indeed any such doubt was left in people’s minds.
While these were important, however, Germany did not begin its arduous path away from zero hour with concern for the past.
Indeed, the Adenauer years after 1949 were described by many as years of “restoration” because too many minor Nazi figures had remained in their jobs.
In some ways, the country simply ignored their past and moved forward.
Years later when a market economy and political democracy were established, Germany did turn toward “coping with the past”, and did so very effectively.
Germany’s Nazi past is uniquely horrible, so comparisons with other countries with blighted histories are misleading.
Still, in its own way Poland has followed a similar path after 1989: first the new, then the attempt to come to terms with the past.
On balance this is a better method of dealing with a nation’s zero hour than doing things the other way round.
In Europe then, the 8th of May 2005 is an occasion to look back in sorrow and anger. It is also an occasion to look forward with pride in the achievements of recent decades and therefore for hope.

The Fate of the Global Balance Sheet
HONG KONG – Just as a corporate balance sheet can provide insights into a company’s financial health, a “global balance sheet” (GBS), tallying the assets and liabilities of governments, corporations, households, and financial institutions, can do the same for the world economy.
That logic drove the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) to begin compiling, and regularly updating, a GBS covering ten countries that together represent more than 60% of world GDP.
MGI’s first GBS, released in late 2021, showed that during the first 20 years of this century, global assets grew faster than output.
In 2020, assets on the world’s balance sheet totaled more than $1.5 quadrillion (about 18.1 times their GDP) – about triple the total in 2000 (when assets amounted to about 13.2 times GDP).
The growth of global wealth also outpaced (rather tepid) GDP growth, implying that wealth became increasingly concentrated among those with real estate and financial assets.
In 2020 and 2021 – the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic – these trends accelerated, with the global balance sheet swelling even as GDP growth stalled.
In fact, despite billions of dollars in income losses, $100 trillion was added to global wealth during this period, fueled largely by unprecedented fiscal and monetary expansion.
As $39 trillion in new currency and deposits were minted, asset prices skyrocketed.
Meanwhile, debt liabilities grew by about $50 trillion, and equity liabilities by $75 trillion.
Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the expansion of the financial sector, mainly through debt creation, has played a major role in boosting net worth (assets minus liabilities), mostly via the price effect.
In the 2000-21 period, 50% of the increase in net worth came from asset-price increases above inflation, 29% from general inflation, and only 23% from net investment.
So, though global net worth grew, investment in the real economy remained relatively low.
Excessive financialization thus undermined productivity growth.
The picture changed significantly in 2022.
While financialization continued, the GBS shrank relative to GDP for the first time in decades.
Russia’s war against Ukraine, which has driven up energy and food prices, exacerbated inflation, spurring major central banks to hike interest rates.
Real global equity and bond prices declined by about 30% and 20%, respectively, sapping net worth in many countries, especially Australia, Canada, China, Germany, and Sweden.
Meanwhile, a declining real-estate market reduced not only net worth (wealth), but also consumption, particularly in China, where real estate constitutes some 60% of household assets.
As 2023 begins, the obvious question is: Will 2022 mark a turning point, after which the GBS will continue its slide, or will global assets and wealth resume their climb relative to GDP?
The answer depends significantly on policies in China, which accounted for 18% of world GDP and global net worth in 2021.
Judging from the recent Central Economic Work Conference – where the economic-policy agenda is decided each year – Chinese policymakers will focus on stimulating demand, stabilizing the housing market, and supporting growth using fiscal and monetary tools.
For example, Vice Premier Liu He announced plans to boost fiscal support and increase liquidity for the stressed real-estate sector.
But the challenges for Chinese policymakers extend much further.
The zero-COVID policy proved highly disruptive to China’s economy.
But the relaxation of pandemic restrictions – a process that has just begun – will also prove disruptive, threatening to undermine public health and confidence.
As the government works to protect public health, it must also secure people’s livelihoods and safeguard social stability.
A global slowdown – caused partly by the Ukraine War – may also be a drag on global aggregate demand, hurting Chinese trade, while continued supply-chain disruptions will compound the damage.
And then there is the demand-crushing impact of natural disasters, which are becoming increasingly likely as climate change progresses.
(It is worth noting that the GBS fails to account for natural capital – which is declining precipitously – as valuation standards were set only last year.
Human capital is also excluded.)
Making matters worse, economic relations with the United States are becoming increasingly fraught, with the US implementing measures – such as restrictions on sales of semiconductors and the machines that produce them – aimed at starving China’s economy of advanced technologies and components.
That is why China’s leaders have signaled support for private business and state-owned enterprises, including the easing of regulatory actions that disrupted business confidence in various sectors.
US policies targeting China point to a bigger problem: international economic cooperation is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain.
But the GBS shows that, while policy mistakes in large, systemically important economies can push down the entire global economy, no single economy today can lift it.
In other words, cooperation is vital to prevent a classic balance-sheet recession (when asset markets deflate, and liquidity is tightened).
Just as the use of nuclear weapons promises “mutual assured destruction,” lack of economic cooperation will lead to “mutual assured deflation,” because no single country can revive global demand.
Worse, as conditions deteriorate, governments might be tempted to pursue even more protectionist policies – forgetting the lessons of the Great Depression.
Understandably, economic planners in China and elsewhere are preparing for recession.

Is a Global Recession Really Around the Corner?
CAMBRIDGE – The world’s leading economists spent most of 2022 convincing themselves that, if the global economy was not already in a recession, it was about to fall into one.
But with the year’s end, the global slump has been postponed to 2023.
Clearly, the reports that the United States was in recession during the first half of the year were premature, especially given how tight the US labor market is.
And, despite the confidence with which many again proclaim the inevitability of a downturn, the chances of one in the coming year are well below 100%.
But, owing to the rapid interest-rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks, there is something like a 50% chance of a recession in 2023 and a 75% chance of it happening at some point during the next two years.
Europe, hit hard by soaring energy prices, is more likely to head into a recession, which conventional wisdom defines as two consecutive quarters of GDP decline.
China, however, seems to be in even worse shape.
It has the same problems as Europe, plus a collapsing property sector and a surge in COVID-19 cases, owing to the Chinese government’s recent decision to reopen the economy without a sufficient vaccination push.
While China’s growth next year is expected to be far slower than the historic pace it has become accustomed to over the past four decades, it is unlikely that its GDP will contract for two quarters.
After all, even an eight-percentage-point decrease in Chinese GDP growth during the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis was not enough to cause its domestic output to shrink in absolute terms.
This is yet another example of the flaws in defining recession by the rule of two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.
Moreover, many countries’ current economic woes are self-inflicted, owing to policy errors that have been as harmful as they were predictable.
Between 2011 and 2021, for example, Europe needlessly deepened its dependence on Russian natural gas, leaving it exceedingly vulnerable when the Kremlin launched its war against Ukraine.
Likewise, China’s draconian zero-COVID policy came at a high economic cost, while the absence of a plan for how to ease pandemic restrictions meant that China’s containment strategy merely postponed COVID mortalities.
The US, for its part, has made numerous mistakes, including willingly relinquishing its leadership of the liberal international order and ignoring the World Trade Organization and the trade frameworks that its members had negotiated over many years.
Former President Donald Trump’s tariffs were wrong, yet President Joe Biden has done little to reverse them.
In fact, the “buy American” provisions in his otherwise-laudable Inflation Reduction Act flout WTO rules.
While the expected adverse effects of higher interest rates are not yet evident, there are signs that the “everything bubble” has finally burst.
US stock prices peaked in January 2022 and have been trending downward since.
Bonds, real estate, and emerging-market assets are all down for the year as well.
In July 2021, I argued that there was a 90% chance that the asset bubbles dominating financial markets would burst.
Historically high valuations – relative to dividends, earnings, or incomes – were an obvious indicator, although real and even nominal interest rates were zero or negative this time last year.
A low discount rate meant that virtually any asset-price level could be rationalized as the present discounted value of future income.
This year began with four kinds of assets more clearly screaming, “I am a bubble”: meme stocks like Gamestop, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and special-purpose acquisition companies.
Each was innovative, although not necessarily in a good way, and all collapsed by the end of the year.
But should savvy investors see these declines as opportunities and “buy the dip”?
Given that stock prices are not yet back to where they were three years ago, on the eve of the pandemic, it is reasonable to assume that they might fall further before they are in line with economic fundamentals.
The same might be said of cryptocurrencies, which have no fundamental value whatsoever.
While next year will be rough for the world economy, the coming slump probably should not qualify as a recession, even considering that the two-consecutive-quarters criterion is too narrow.
Global growth in the postwar period has seldom fallen below zero for a single quarter, let alone two.
By that measure, the severe oil-shock-induced downturns of 1974 and 1981 do not qualify as global recessions.
Even in times of apparent recession, positive growth among emerging and developing economies tends to outweigh advanced economies’ negative growth, the two notable exceptions being the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.
While the OECD and International Monetary Fund expect global growth to plunge to 2.2-2.7% in 2023, from 6.1% in 2021, that still leaves the world economy unlikely to shrink for consecutive quarters.
Even if we adopt less strict measures of defining a global recession, such as a decline of GDP growth below 2.5%, a 2023 global recession is hardly a foregone conclusion.
Is it possible?
Of course. But it is also entirely avoidable.

Oil’s Uncertain Comeback
CALGARY – As global economic growth picks up practically everywhere, oil producers are becoming increasingly hopeful that the recent impressive price recovery will continue.
But, if those hopes are to be fulfilled, not only will producers have to control what they can (by maintaining production discipline); what lies beyond their control (output from shale and the value of the dollar) will also have to work in their favor.
Just over three years ago, oil (WTI) was trading above $100 per barrel.
But, by early 2016, prices had plummeted to around $30 per barrel, owing to a combination of sluggish demand, alternative supply (particularly shale oil and gas from the United States), and a new OPEC production paradigm under which the cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, withdrew from acting as a “swing producer.”
In the wake of the resulting collapse of export receipts and budget revenues, OPEC adopted a new approach, based on a modernized production agreement with two key features: greater flexibility for countries facing especially complex internal conditions (such as Libya) and the inclusion of non-OPEC producers, particularly Russia.
Together, OPEC and non-OPEC countries established a floor from which oil prices could bounce.
With the pickup in global growth and the emergence of geopolitical uncertainties (which could constrain output in some oil-producing countries), oil prices have rebounded to above $60 per barrel.
The current global growth phase is particularly good for the price of oil (and other commodities), because it is synchronized, real, and, increasingly, self-reinforcing. It is being powered by simultaneous recovery in the systemically important economies of Europe, Japan, the US, and the emerging world.
And it is based on durable gains in economic activity, rather than just financial engineering.
Given these features, today’s global growth spurt is starting to generate a virtuous cycle among consumption, investment, and trade.
And that dynamic could pick up even more momentum, especially if the recent pro-growth measures in the US and the endogenous healing in Europe are buttressed by structural reforms, more balanced demand management, and improved international policy coordination.
In fact, the downside risks for oil prices have shifted from the demand side to the supply side.
Higher oil prices tend to erode production discipline in OPEC, particularly by members (such as Nigeria and Venezuela) that have historically rushed to secure higher revenues to mitigate difficult budgetary conditions, at the expense of their peers (such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates).
This tendency makes coordination with non-OPEC producers more difficult.
Add to that the increased production from alternative sources (most consequentially, shale) that higher prices encouraged, and the beneficial demand effects are offset, if not overwhelmed.
Yet, with some minor modifications to the current agreement, OPEC members should be able to maintain their collective production discipline, assuming the will is there.
They may find it harder to continue to rein in non-OPEC countries. But, with thoughtful negotiations that incorporate insights from game theory, this, too, is possible.
When it comes to the factors over which oil producers have less control, the outlook is less hopeful.
The depreciation of the US dollar – which fell 10%, in trade-weighted terms, in 2017 – has helped to drive up oil prices, but it is likely to be halted and then partly reversed.
Avoiding that outcome would require Europe and Japan to continue to outperform market expectations, both overall and, more important, relative to the US.
Moreover, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan would need to tighten monetary policy – including accelerating the taper of their large-scale asset purchases – faster than markets expect.
Finally, there is the challenge posed by increased shale production.
And the fact is that there is little the traditional oil producers can do to counter shale producers’ likely response to higher prices.
Given this, oil producers would be well advised to treat recent oil-price gains as a temporary windfall, not a permanent state of affairs or even – unless there is a notable geopolitical shock – a trend that is likely to intensify in the year ahead.
This means that producers should resist the temptation to use their higher revenues for new recurrent spending.
And they should act quickly to reinforce their collective discipline to minimize the risk of a free-for-all that negates the hard-earned gains of recent years.

The World Bank Must Change Course
BRUSSELS – Critics have called new World Bank president David Malpass an arsonist in charge of a fire department, because of past comments he made on Bank salaries and loans to China.
But it’s far more important to focus on improving progress toward the World Bank’s core mission of ending extreme poverty.
In its most recent fiscal year, the Bank dished out nearly $67 billion in financing, investments, and guarantees.
But under the “new course” set by its previous president, Jim Yong Kim, in 2016, the Bank aims to direct more than a quarter of its funding toward climate change.
Moreover, thanks to Kim, the Bank insists that every single dollar it spends must take account of climate change, and it has ended financial support for coal-fired power plants.
The argument for approaching development through the prism of climate change is that rising temperatures exacerbate challenges such as malaria and lack of access to education.
Though this is true, almost all problems impact all others.
An increase in malaria makes children more susceptible to hunger; poor nutrition and a lack of sanitation worsen educational performance; missing school leads to greater poverty; and so on.
The more important consideration is which policy helps the most.Should we help the poor by cutting carbon dioxide emissions now and reducing temperatures a bit in 100 years’ time, or instead focus immediately on malaria and education?
The evidence clearly shows that direct policies are much more effective.
The World Bank’s climate focus is also at odds with what the world’s poorest citizens want.
When the United Nations asked almost ten million people around the world to list their priorities, they emphasized better education and health care, less corruption, more jobs, and affordable food.
Global warming came last out of 16 issues.
Under Kim, the Bank propagated the simplistic idea that fossil fuels are always damaging, coal must be forbidden, and “climate aid” is the solution.
The truth is far more complex.
Fossil fuels do contribute to global warming – but also to prosperity and wellbeing.
One billion people worldwide live in homes that lack the energy to light even a single bulb.
And more than three billion live in countries without reliable, 24-hour energy networks that can power hospitals and factories.
In practice, the World Bank’s policy of ditching fossil fuels and adopting a “climate lens” often means supporting off-grid solar cells that provide only enough power for a single lightbulb or to recharge a mobile phone.
In some places, that can be important.
But in most situations, off-grid cells are useless for tackling the main power challenges of the world’s poor.
No country in history has become prosperous and globally competitive through off-grid energy.
Every high-income economy relies on abundant, cheap, and mostly fossil fuel-driven energy.
At the same time, three billion people currently suffer from terrible indoor air pollution, because poverty forces them to burn dirty fuels such as wood and dung to cook and keep warm.
But solar panels cannot power clean stoves or heaters, or refrigerators that would stop vaccines and food from spoiling.
Nor can they power the agricultural and industrial machinery that supports jobs and pathways out of poverty.
In that respect, distributing solar panels is mostly a way for rich people to feel good about taking action on global warming.
Rich and poor countries alike use coal because it is often still the cheapest, most dependable source of energy.
The International Energy Agency estimates that even by 2040, new solar and wind power will still be more expensive in all major markets than existing coal, after the intermittent production of green energy is taken into account.
Similarly, a Copenhagen Consensus study looked at the effects of building coal-fired power plants in Bangladesh.
The study estimated that these plants would cause global climate damage worth $0.6 billion over the next 15 years.
That’s not trivial.
But by increasing the energy available for industrial development, the project would generate total benefits of $258 billion – about 500 times greater than the damages.
As a result, the average Bangladeshi would be 16% richer by 2030.
The project could afford to offset emissions and still be hugely effective.
These are the calculations the World Bank should make.
By denying a loan that would finance such coal-fired power plants, the Bank would avoid 23 cents of costs while foregoing $100 of development benefits.
That’s neither moral nor sensible.
There is a direct connection between power supplies and prosperity.
The World Bank itself recently published a study suggesting that living in a community with power shortages reduces a person’s chances of employment by 35%-41%.
And unsurprisingly, another study showed that distributing solar panels has no measurable impact beyond providing some electricity, and does not increase savings, spending, employment, income, or educational access for children.
The world will reduce its reliance on fossil fuels only when genuine alternatives are cheaper and better.
This will require innovative research and development to bring the price of green energy below that of fossil fuels.
The World Bank could even play a role in supporting this.
But Malpass must first refocus the Bank on its core mission.
Despite its poorly considered climate focus, the Bank does a lot of important work.
Malpass should ensure that it concentrates on its most effective initiatives – including freer trade, combating tuberculosis, early childhood nutrition, family planning, and computer-aided education.
The new World Bank president has a chance to make his mark on a still-valuable organization.
He should start by making a renewed commitment to eradicating poverty – including the energy poverty that wrecks so many lives.

How Economic Superpowers Rise
Anti-Japanese riots across China have heightened tensions in Asia.
Indeed China-mania, a mixture of hopes, but mostly fears, is sweeping the world due to China’s rapid economic rise.
Should the world really be more fearful than hopeful?
Americans fear their markets being flooded by Chinese goods.
Mexico, Brazil, Central Europe, Indonesia, and even Sri Lanka are worried about competition from lower wages.
Europeans may be more cheerful, believing that the Chinese market will open not only for European engineering products and machine tools to equip the new workshop of the world, but also for luxury goods and even the tourism demanded by a new and affluent Chinese middle class.
Everyone feels that a seismic shift is under way.
Such rapid industrial rises are rare, but not unprecedented.
The most interesting analogies are Germany’s rise in the 19th century and Japan’s in the 20th.
Even prior to that time, England was the economic Wunderkind of Europe.
What had been an offshore European island with bad weather emerged as the world’s major economy, whose products, from textiles to railroad equipment, came to dominate world markets.
England was a pioneer in industrialization, and was deeply shocked by the presumption of newcomers who soon entered the same stage.
By the end of the 19th century, however, Germany, with much lower wages levels, had overtaken England in steel production, and was clearly dominant in the new technologies of electrical goods, chemicals, and dyes, as well as in many aspects of fine engineering.
But Germany also swamped world’s markets with mass consumption goods: cheaper musical instruments than the traditional makers in France or Italy could produce, and lithographic prints used for Christmas cards and seaside postcards.
Indeed, German products were omnipresent.
When an irate British writer, E.E. Williams, wrote a protest entitled “Made in Germany,” he began by recording his discomfort that the pencil he was using was a German product as well.
The ‘Made in Germany’ scare of the late 19th century foreshadowed the reaction in the United States to Japan’s industrial success in the 1960’s and 1970’s.
In particular, Americans were frightened by Japanese consumer products – televisions, which wiped out domestic production, and automobiles, which seemed so malignly efficient.
In both the German and the Japanese cases, the already-existing industrial powers complained that there was some sort of nefarious and unfair mechanism behind the newcomer’s advantages.
Such explanations included government intervention or a new sort of industrial organization, and unfair patent infringements by the new producers who copied products and then blocked off their own markets from import competition.
But the economics of the rise of industrial Germany and Japan should hold comforting lessons for us today.
The fears were misplaced, because the world benefited from cheaper and more readily available products.
Thanks to German manufacturers, pianos were no longer restricted to aristocratic salons or the professional middle class, but began appearing in respectable working-class homes.
Thanks to Japanese car producers, American manufacturers learned to produce more efficiently and competitively.
The classical liberal free-trade argument about the universal economic benefits of greater commerce and open markets proved to be unambiguously correct.
It did not matter that the catch-up countries’ economic “miracles” were produced in part by illiberal policies guided by government bureaucracies.
The outcome was an endorsement of the lessons of economic liberalism.
But changing economic balances also lead to changing political balances.
At the moment, it looks as if there is nothing to fear from China.
Like Germany in the mid-19th century, or Japan in the 1960’s, China sees many advantages in participating in the international order more or less as it is currently configured.
Can this change?
Germany certainly became assertive, owing mostly to the social pressures and tensions incited by rapid economic growth.
When it feared that it might be overtaken by the next rising economic power, the vast Russian empire, assertiveness turned into aggression.
By the early 20th century, Germans had concluded that Russia’s faster demographic growth and rapid industrialization posed a military threat.
China can already see considerable problems in the medium term.
In forty years, a demographic implosion within China, the consequence of its one-child policy, will make European and Japanese concerns about aging populations look trivial.
Before then, profound inequalities between China’s poor countryside and its dynamic industrial centers will generate tensions, which may be increased by the gender imbalance – young men greatly outnumber young women.
Combine this with a tottering authoritarian regime, and something like the pre-1914 German scenario looks realistic.
A government impressed by past national achievement, but fearful of being overtaken and deeply worried about its own legitimacy, is likely to look for an outlet in foreign policy to mobilize domestic support or ward off opposition.
So there is no need for a strategy to deal with China’s economic rise; but there is a need to lock in China’s prosperity and reduce the chances of political eruption.
Japan in the second half of the 20th century had stable politics, due in large part to a good constitution and democratic institutions.
If China is to avoid the fate of early 20th century Germany, it must bolster successful economic modernization with constitutional and political reform.

Coase’s Chinese Legacy
HONG KONG – The recent death of Ronald H. Coase, the founding father of new institutional economics, is a great loss to Chinese economists who are seeking an effective framework for understanding China’s ongoing economic transformation.
His legacy – insights into the role of firms, financial institutions, and the state in shaping the market and driving economic development – will prove crucial as China works to achieve high-income status.
With two seminal papers, Coase changed the way economists view institutions’ impact on an economy.
His 1937 paper “The Nature of the Firm” introduced the concept of transaction costs into discussions of a firm’s structure, function, and limitations.
And his 1960 paper “The Problem of Social Cost” proposed that the state could manage the negative externalities, such as pollution or traffic, of economic activities through well-defined property rights.
In his final years, Coase shifted his focus to the emergence of capitalism and the creation of markets in China.
According to Coase, since the period of reform and opening up began in 1979, China has been a living experiment in institutional evolution, shaped simultaneously by the central government and by local governments and enterprises.
This evolution is at the center of a case study of Foshan – a city of seven million people located near Guangzhou, at the heart of the Pearl River Delta – launched last year by a team of Chinese researchers (of which we were a part).
As it turns out, Foshan may well be the ideal example to test Coase’s views.
Given Foshan’s proximity to Hong Kong, it is firmly embedded in global supply chains – a fact that has helped to drive rapid nominal GDP growth, from roughly ¥1.3 billion in 1978 to ¥670.9 billion ($109.7 billion) last year.
The private sector – focused on the production of home appliances, machinery equipment, construction materials, textiles, and food – accounts for more than 60% of Foshan’s GDP.
Foshan is also home to the world’s largest wholesale lighting and furniture markets, and its products are exported internationally.
According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Foshan is China’s most competitive prefecture-level city, and its eighth most competitive city overall, owing partly to institutional innovations by local governments at the township, district, and prefecture levels.
These innovations enabled Foshan to create markets that were largely defunct before 1979, while coping with rapid urbanization, industrialization, and globalization.
Foshan’s development offers important insight into the core problem that China is now facing: how to transform a low value-added, manufacturing-based economy into a high value-added, innovation-fueled economy.
While the previous model brought 30 years of success in terms of GDP growth, it generated considerable risks and imbalances – including environmental degradation, social inequities, excessive debt, industrial over-capacity, and a bloated state sector.
As Foshan’s experience demonstrates, cities can play a pivotal role in correcting these imbalances and driving China’s economic transition.
The Chinese city evolved as a walled-in seat of power centered around a marketplace.
Indeed, the two characters that comprise the Chinese word for city (城市) mean “castle” (城) and “market” (市) – an apt juxtaposition, which endures today in the form of the relationship between collective state-led action to build strong markets and private-sector competition within and among cities.
In terms of physical infrastructure, China’s most dynamic cities – such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Foshan – already resemble Western metropolises like Paris and Chicago.
But this “hardware” is inefficient without the “software” needed to manage it – namely, as Coase suggested, an efficient property-rights infrastructure (the laws, procedures, and administrative capacity needed to support efficient, fair, and innovative markets).
The convergence of consumer lifestyles and preferences driven by globalization has enabled the world’s major cities to specialize production for global markets.
But, given regional differences in political, social, and economic arrangements – often reflecting the particularities of local history and culture – significant divergences in citizens’ attitudes remain.
Responsibility for ensuring the smooth functioning of markets despite these disparities falls to the state.
In other words, markets are global networks, which depend on cities to serve as hubs; cities, in turn, require state coordination of supply chains to deliver market-enabling public goods effectively.
China’s growth story has entailed the orchestration of at least four supply chains: a global production supply chain, run largely by the private sector; a logistics supply chain, run by state-owned enterprises; a finance supply chain, mainly comprising state-owned banks; and a government-services supply chain.
Cities like Foshan have benefited substantially from the effective coordination of these networks.
But a fifth supply chain – that of human talent – has largely been neglected, and cities cannot achieve their potential unless they can attract the best human talent.
A Coasian analysis of China’s development would center on the complex interaction between the locally minded state and the globally minded market, with the key lesson being that, contrary to free-market ideology, less government does not necessarily mean more market.
Rather, an expanding market needs a strong government, but with a more targeted approach that emphasizes, for example, developing the property-rights infrastructure, building the human talent pool, and implementing macroeconomic policies that support high-quality growth.
Neither capitalism nor socialism has fully revealed how to achieve efficient GDP growth, an inclusive society, and ecological sustainability simultaneously.
If China applies Coase’s institutional insights to develop an effective development framework, it may well manage to strike this crucial balance.

One Flew Over the Resource Curse
GENEVA – Geopolitical insight is often gained through real-life experience, rather than big-picture thinking.
Arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris from Conakry, Guinea, is a case in point: Conakry’s airport, located in one of the world’s poorest countries, outperforms France’s prestigious global hub in terms of cleanliness, service, and pride.
By amplifying such exemplars into a national project, Guinea could join the small group of commodity-rich countries that have bucked the curse of corruption and economic decay that often accompanies large natural-resource endowments.
History demonstrates the difficulty of avoiding the so-called “resource curse” – and that it does not plague only less-developed countries like Nigeria, as many assume.
In the 1980’s, the United Kingdom’s North Sea-driven oil and gas boom undermined the country’s broad-based economic competitiveness, while Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s government wasted much of the revenue on handouts that encouraged excessive consumption.
While a handful of commodity-rich countries have managed to buck the curse, including Botswana, Chile, and Norway, they have, nevertheless, failed to diversify their economies, remaining dependent on natural resource-based exports.
But history is not destined to repeat itself, and leaders of commodity-rich countries are seeking alternative futures.
Countries across Africa – including Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda – are showing early signs of success.
Zambia recently issued a $750 million inaugural ten-year bond at an annual interest rate of 5.375%.
Oversubscribed by 24 times, the issue will allow Zambia to borrow more cheaply than many European countries can.
Such developments reflect growing confidence in Africa’s economic prospects and, thus, in its ability to escape the resource curse.
But these countries still face significant obstacles to development.
First, governments must balance long-term goals with short-term achievements.
Given unlimited time, less-developed commodity-rich countries would first invest in human capital and institutions, then direct their growing commodity revenues into infrastructure, and move on to diversify their economies by strengthening the agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors.
In the real world, of course, such countries’ political economies demand short-term gains, beginning with basic services like potable water and electricity.
If governments fail to respond to these basic demands, citizens take to the streets, often destructively.
This summer in Guinea, for example, citizens’ frustration with widespread poverty and weak institutions, memories of ethnic persecution, and distrust of unfamiliar democratic processes fueled violent protests.
Second, development requires both money and the right conditions.
But, in many cases, the conditions placed on funding create barriers to investment.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank lead the chorus of traditional players eager to help, offering debt write-offs and concessionary finance.
But the stringent institutional reforms that they demand, while beneficial in theory, might not stabilize, let alone enhance, the development process.
Newcomers, most notably China, have become a ready alternative source of cheap finance.
But, in exchange, the Chinese expect business opportunities and, to some extent, political influence.
Sovereign-wealth funds, too, are increasingly involved in financing development.
But, despite being state-owned and subject to policy decisions, they function as commercial enterprises (with the possible exception of Norway’s hydrocarbon-funded state-owned investment vehicles).
Financing for the most expensive projects – implementing green-energy systems, building transport infrastructure, and developing modern cities – must come from foreign institutional investors.
But high-quality private investors are resistant to financing lumpy, illiquid investments in fragile, volatile states.
Those who are willing to engage often demand steep risk premiums that dramatically increase the cost of capital, often to usurious levels.
Global mining companies like Rio Tinto are increasingly working alongside emerging-economy leaders like China’s Chalco to support development.
As the most heavily invested, they have the most experience using cheap debt to create value.
But, with commodity prices beginning to drop, even the most bullish companies are reassessing ambitious investment plans – a trend reflected in the Brazilian mining giant Vale’s recent decision to put its investment in Guinea on hold.
Bucking the resource curse requires, first and foremost, strong, legitimate domestic political leadership, underpinned by effective institutional arrangements.
But it also requires a global investment community – public, private, and mixed – that can move beyond short-term thinking, ideological bias, ignorance, and cynicism.
After all, bets on leadership, vision, and earnings potential should not be limited to investments in California-based technology start-ups.
Guinea, which is making progress despite annual per capita income of roughly $450, exemplifies the potential of the world’s poorest countries to surpass expectations.
Investors should take note.

Nationalism Will Go Bankrupt
ROME – Nationalism versus globalism, not populism versus elitism, appears to be this decade’s defining political conflict.
Almost wherever we look – at the United States or Italy or Germany or Britain, not to mention China, Russia, and India – an upsurge of national feeling has become the main driving force of political events.
By contrast, the supposed rebellion of “common people” against elites has not been much in evidence.
Billionaires have taken over US politics under President Donald Trump; unelected professors run the “populist” Italian government; and all over the world, taxes have been slashed on the ever-rising incomes of financiers, technologists, and corporate managers.
Meanwhile, ordinary workers have resigned themselves to the reality that high-quality housing, education, and even health care are hopelessly beyond their reach.
The dominance of nationalism over egalitarianism is particularly striking in Italy and Britain, two countries once famous for their phlegmatic sense of national identity.
Flags in Britain are notable for their absence even on government buildings, and until the Brexit referendum the people there were so relaxed about their nationhood that they could not even be bothered to agree on the country’s name: the United Kingdom, Britain, or England, Wales, and Scotland.
Italians were even less nationalistic.
Since the European Union’s founding, Italians have been the biggest proponents of federalism, with opinion polls showing that, until recently, voters had more trust in EU leaders in Brussels than in their own government in Rome.
Italians are passionate about their culture, history, food, and football, but their patriotism has mostly been directed to regions and cities, not to the nation state.
They prefer to be ruled from Brussels than from Rome.
The far-right League party, the junior member in Italy’s new coalition government, was still called the Northern League until this year.
One of its favorite slogans was “Garibaldi did not unite Italy; he divided Africa,” and its main political demand was the country’s abolition.
Instead, the party demanded the creation of a new country called Padania that would separate the prosperous northern regions from the corruption and poverty of Rome and points south.
What, then, explains the sudden dominance of nationalism?
There is not much positively patriotic about the new nationalism in Italy, Britain, or even the US.
Instead, the upsurge of national feeling seems largely a xenophobic phenomenon, as famously defined by the Czech-American sociologist Karl Deutsch: “A nation is a group of people linked together by a common error about their ancestry and a common dislike of their neighbors.”
Hard times – low wages, inequality, regional deprivation, and post-crisis austerity – provoke a hunt for scapegoats, and foreigners are always a tempting target.
There is nothing patriotic about Trump’s belligerence against Mexican immigrants and Canadian imports, or the nativist policies of the new Italian government, or Theresa May’s most famous statement after becoming UK Prime Minister: “If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere.
You don’t understand what citizenship means.”
Now for some good news for those of us still proud to be “citizens of the world”: The xenophobic effort to blame economic hardship on foreigners is doomed to failure.
Consider the post-crisis effort to divert popular anger about the collapse of market fundamentalist economics onto “greedy bankers.”
This ultimately failed, in part because bankers have huge resources to defend themselves, which foreigners generally do not.
But banker-bashing failed to assuage public anger mainly because attacking finance did nothing to boost wages, diminish inequality, or reverse social neglect.
The same will be true of the current attacks on foreign influence, whether through immigration or trade.
Britain, for example, is gradually waking up to the fact that European issues have nothing to do with the genuine political grievances that motivated a large part of the “Leave” vote.
Instead, the Brexit negotiations will now dominate and distract British politics for many years, or even decades.
And Britain’s nationalist confrontation with the rest of Europe will offer politicians of all parties endless excuses for failing to improve everyday life.
In the months or years ahead, voters in the US and Italy will learn the same lesson.
There, too, scapegoating foreign influences, whether through trade or immigration, will do nothing to lift living standards or address the sources of political discontent.
Italy has legitimate grievances against the EU: hypocritical and inequitable policies on asylum and sea rescues, self-defeating fiscal rules, and economically illiterate financial policies.
But the new government is also exploiting the nationalist upsurge to attack reforms that have nothing to do with Europe and are vital to Italy’s economic success.
Successive Italian governments since the financial crisis have gradually laid the foundations for pension, labor market, and banking reforms.
These changes have created the conditions for economic recovery, which began last year, following a decade of recession; but they have been politically unpopular and are now being denounced as symbols of elitist foreign oppression.
If the new government abandons all three reform projects, Italians can also abandon hope of economic recovery, perhaps for another decade.
The US will also discover that attacking foreign interests is no panacea and can make hardship worse.
Trump thinks his measures against imports from China, Germany, and Canada will hurt these trading partners and create American jobs.
This might have been true when the US economy was suffering weak growth and deflation.
But in a world of strong demand and rising inflation, German and Chinese exporters will find new markets for their products, whereas US manufacturers will struggle to replace foreign suppliers.
BMW and Huawei will be just fine, whereas tariffs will act as a tax on American consumers, through higher prices, and on American workers, businesses, and homeowners, through rising interest rates.
The opposite of populist nationalism is not globalist elitism; it is economic realism.
And in the end, reality will win.

Is Africa Still Rising?
WASHINGTON, DC – Between 2000 and 2014, Africa grew at a strong clip, fueling belief in the narrative of an “Africa rising.”
But, since 2015, growth across Sub-Saharan Africa has weakened, and the poor outlook for commodity prices has cast doubt on Africa’s economic promise, leading many to question the “Africa rising” narrative – and some to pronounce it dead.
Such skepticism is, to some extent, understandable.
The 2014 oil-price shock hit several African economies especially hard, and played a role in pushing aggregate growth down from 5-6% in 2004-2014 to just 2.5% in 2015-2017 – a rate that barely keeps up with population growth.
Moreover, the continent's three largest economies – Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa – have experienced major declines in performance.
Last year, Angola and South Africa’s economies stagnated, while the Nigerian economy actually contracted for the first time since 1991.
The latest projections suggest that these economies will experience tepid recoveries in the coming years.
But Africa’s skeptics have overlooked a number of important factors.
For starters, when one sets the three largest economies aside, Sub-Saharan Africa’s aggregate-growth rate for this year rises from 2.5% to almost 4%.
That is faster than the 3.5% rate at which the global economy is currently growing.
In fact, five of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are in Africa.
And over the next five years, around half of all Sub-Saharan economies will expand at an average rate similar to or higher than that which prevailed during the “Africa rising” heyday.
Furthermore, high commodity prices were just one factor in the region’s strong economic performance between 2000 and 2014.
Many African countries have made vast improvements to macroeconomic management, governance, and the business environment, and entrepreneurship is on the rise.
Even with lower commodity prices, these developments will continue to bolster many African economies.
Today’s skepticism may reflect lasting memories from a darker period, and fears that Africa’s progress has not been sufficiently consolidated.
From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, dictators ruled in many African countries, and the institutions necessary for sustaining strong economic growth were fragile at best.
With civil wars constantly shredding the social fabric in many countries, the continent experienced decades of tepid economic growth.
By 2000, it had been reduced to what The Economist called “Hopeless Africa.”
But those days are gone.
Policymakers across the continent have sustained the 1990s-era reforms that set the stage for the subsequent period of high growth.
Although there is still much work to be done, the economic and business environment in many African countries has continued to improve, and institutions and governance have grown stronger.
Owing to new information and communication technologies, Africans, particularly young Africans, are better informed, more engaged in civil and political discourse, and increasingly capable of holding their leaders accountable.
ICTs have also unleashed a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship across the continent.
These positive trends are not likely to be reversed, and will continue to improve the economic conditions in Africa, even if commodity prices do not rebound.
After all, the region’s economic growth averaged 5.6% between 2000 and 2004, before commodity prices had begun their rapid ascent.
But that is not to say Africa will be spared from daunting challenges in the years ahead.
Globally, the economic environment will become less favorable for African economies.
In the major advanced economies, interest rates will soon rise, and the political backlash against globalization may force governments to abandon their past commitments to development assistance.
In light of all this uncertainty, African policymakers should look inward, by focusing on policies to mobilize national resources and finance their economic agendas.
Those agendas should include a number of key priorities.
African countries need to diversify their economies to withstand future shocks better, while also accelerating the pace of industrialization across the continent.
Governments will have to find a way to create decent jobs for the 11 million people now entering the region’s labor force every year.
And they will need to enact policies to reduce poverty, and ensure that prosperity is shared across all cohorts of society.
These are particularly important goals for Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa.
Angola and Nigeria need to become far less reliant on oil; and South Africa still needs to implement far-reaching reforms to address structural problems that have plagued it since the apartheid era.
Seeing these projects through will require competent political leaders who are committed to the principles of good governance.
Failure could result in an extended period of low growth.
But even if Africa’s three largest economies do end up in the doldrums, it will not necessarily seal the fate of the “Africa rising” story.
After all, “Africa rising” need not mean “all” of Africa.
From the 1960s to the 1990s, the “Asian Tigers” narrative referred only to Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, excluding other developing countries in Asia, such as China.
Similarly, African economies are increasingly differentiating themselves, and should thus be evaluated individually, on the merits of their respective economic policies.

The High Cost of Food Monopolies in Africa
LAGOS – In May, global food prices increased 1.2%, reaching their highest level since October 2017.
This upward trajectory is having a disproportionate impact in Africa, where the share of household income spent on food is also rising.
To ensure food security, governments must work quickly to reverse these trends, and one place to start is by policing the producers who are feeding the frenzy.
According to data compiled by the World Economic Forum, four of the world’s top five countries in terms of food expenditure are in Africa.
Nigeria leads the list, with a staggering 56.4% of household income in 2015 spent on food, followed by Kenya (46.7%), Cameroon (45.6%), and Algeria (42.5%).
By comparison, consumers in the United States spend the least globally (6.4%), far less than people in emerging economies like Brazil (16%) and India (30%).
One reason for the distortion is the price of food relative to income.
As Africa urbanizes, people are buying more imported semi- or fully processed foods, which cost more than locally produced foods.
And in most countries, wages have not kept pace with inflation.
But the primary cause is poor public policy: African governments have failed to curb the power of agribusinesses and large food producers, a lack of oversight that has made local agriculture less competitive.
In turn, prices for most commodities have risen.
The absence of antitrust laws, combined with weak consumer protection, means that in many countries, only two or three major companies control markets for items like salt, sugar, flour, milk, oil, and tea .
The impact is most pronounced in African cities, where prices for white rice, frozen chicken, bread, butter, eggs, and even carbonated soft drinks are at least 24% higher than in other cities around the world.
These prices hit consumers both directly and indirectly (owing to pass-through of higher input costs by food conglomerates and service providers).
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has long argued that food security and fair pricing depends on markets that are free from monopolistic tendencies.
The OECD concurs, and has frequently called on authorities to address “anti-competitive mergers, abuse of dominance, cartels and price fixing, vertical restraints, and exclusive practices” in the food sector.
And yet, in many African countries, this advice has rarely been heeded.
To be sure, this is not a new problem.
Between 1997 and 2004, for example, the FAO counted 122 allegations of “anti-competitive practices” in 23 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Violations included a “vertical monopoly” in the Malawi sugar sector, price fixing in Kenya’s fertilizer industry, and a “buyer cartel” in the Zimbabwean cotton industry.
And, despite the considerable attention such cases have received, the underlying problems persist.
According to the World Bank, more than 70% of African countries rank in the bottom half globally for efforts to protect “market-based competition.”
While 27 African countries and five regional blocs do have antitrust laws on the books, enforcement is rare.
The remaining countries have no regulations at all and have made little progress in drafting them.
There is one notable exception: South Africa.
Since 1998, the country’s Competition Act has prohibited any company controlling at least 45% of the market from excluding other firms or seeking to exercise control over pricing.
Violators face penalties of up to 10% of their earnings, and during the last two decades, some of the biggest companies in the country – including Tiger Brands, Pioneer Foods, and Sime Darby – have been penalized.
As Tembinkosi Bonakele, head of South Africa’s Competition Commission, noted last year, the government is “determined to root out exploitation of consumers by cartels,” especially in the food industry.
Other countries should follow South Africa’s lead.
Companies and special-interest groups will always seek to benefit from the absence of regulation.
The need for reform is greatest in countries like Nigeria and Ghana, where food expenditures are high and food-industry pressure is most pronounced.
Fortunately, there is growing recognition of the need to address these challenges.
Babatunde Irukera, Director General of the Consumer Protection Council in Nigeria, recently asserted that, “In a large vibrant and loyal market such as Nigeria, the absence of broad competition regulation is tragic.
Unregulated markets in competition context constitute the otherwise ‘legitimate’ vehicle for both financial and social extortion.”
Reducing the prices of staple food by even a modest 10% (far below the average premium cartels around the world charge) by tackling anticompetitive behavior in these sectors, or by reforming regulations that shield them from competition, could lift 270,000 people in Kenya, 200,000 in South Africa, and 20,000 in Zambia out of poverty.
Such a policy would save households in these countries over $700 million (2015 US dollars) a year, with poor households gaining disproportionately more than rich ones.
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of political leaders to protect consumers from collusion and price-fixing.
There is no question that Africa’s businesses need space to innovate and grow, but their success should never come at the cost of someone else’s next meal.

What Use Are Economists?
CAMBRIDGE – When the stakes are high, it is no surprise that battling political opponents use whatever support they can garner from economists and other researchers.
That is what happened when conservative American politicians and European Union officials latched on to the work of two Harvard professors – Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff – to justify their support of fiscal austerity.
Reinhart and Rogoff published a paper that appeared to show that public-debt levels above 90% of GDP significantly impede economic growth.
Three economists from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst then did what academics are routinely supposed to do – replicate their colleagues’ work and subject it to criticism.
Along with a relatively minor spreadsheet error, they identified some methodological choices in the original Reinhart/Rogoff work that threw the robustness of their results into question.
Most important, even though debt levels and growth remained negatively correlated, the evidence for a 90% threshold was revealed to be quite weak.
And, as many have argued, the correlation itself could be the result of low growth leading to high indebtedness, rather than the other way around.
Reinhart and Rogoff have strongly contested accusations by many commentators that they were willing, if not willful, participants in a game of political deception.
They have defended their empirical methods and insist that they are not the deficit hawks that their critics portray them to be.
The resulting firestorm has clouded a salutary process of scrutiny and refinement of economic research.
Reinhart and Rogoff quickly acknowledged the Excel mistake they had made.
The dueling analyses clarified the nature of the data, their limitations, and the difference that alternative methods of processing them made to the results.
Ultimately, Reinhart and Rogoff were not that far apart from their critics on either what the evidence showed or what the policy implications were.
So the silver lining in this fracas is that it showed that economics can progress by the rules of science.
No matter how far apart their political views may have been, the two sides shared a common language about what constitutes evidence and – for the most part – a common approach to resolving differences.
The problem lies elsewhere, in the way that economists and their research are used in public debate.
The Reinhart/Rogoff affair was not just an academic quibble.
Because the 90% threshold had become political fodder, its subsequent demolition also gained broader political meaning.
Despite their protests, Reinhart and Rogoff were accused of providing scholarly cover for a set of policies for which there was, in fact, limited supporting evidence.
One clear lesson is that we need better rules of engagement between economic researchers and policymakers.
A solution that will not work is for economists to second-guess how their ideas will be used or misused in public debate and to shade their public statements accordingly.
For example, Reinhart and Rogoff might have downplayed their results – such as they were – in order to prevent them from being misused by deficit hawks.
But few economists are sufficiently well attuned to have a clear idea of how the politics will play out.
Moreover, when economists adjust their message to fit their audience, the result is the opposite of what is intended: they rapidly lose credibility.
Consider what happens in international trade, where such shading of research is established practice.
For fear of empowering the “protectionist barbarians,” trade economists are prone to exaggerate the benefits of trade and downplay its distributional and other costs.
In practice, this often leads to their arguments being captured by interest groups on the other side – global corporations that seek to manipulate trade rules to their own advantage.
As a result, economists are rarely viewed as honest brokers in the public debate about globalization.
But economists should match honesty about what their research says with honesty about the inherently provisional nature of what passes as evidence in their profession.
Economics, unlike the natural sciences, rarely yields cut-and-dried results.
For one thing, all economic reasoning is contextual, with as many conclusions as potential real-world circumstances.
All economic propositions are “if-then” statements.
Accordingly, figuring out which remedy works best in a particular setting is a craft rather than a science.
Second, empirical evidence is rarely reliable enough to settle decisively a controversy characterized by deeply divided opinion.
This is particularly true in macroeconomics, of course, where data are few and open to diverse interpretations.
But even in microeconomics, where it is sometimes possible to generate precise empirical estimates using randomization techniques, the results must be extrapolated in order to be applied in other settings.
New economic evidence serves at best to nudge the views – a little here, a little there – of those inclined to be open-minded.
In the memorable words of the World Bank’s chief economist, Kaushik Basu, “One thing that experts know, and that non-experts do not, is that they know less than non-experts think they do.”
The implications go beyond not over-selling any particular research result.
Journalists, politicians, and the general public have a tendency to attribute greater authority and precision to what economists say than economists should really feel comfortable with.
Unfortunately, economists are rarely humble, especially in public.
There is one other thing that the public should know about economists: It is cleverness, not wisdom, that advances academic economists’ careers.
Professors at the top universities distinguish themselves today not by being right about the real world, but by devising imaginative theoretical twists or developing novel evidence.
If these skills also render them perceptive observers of real societies and provide them with sound judgment, it is hardly by design.

The Egyptian Crucible
MADRID – As Egyptians tensely awaited the results of their country’s presidential elections, a thread of pessimism ran through the discourse of the young people and secular liberals who had brought down Hosni Mubarak in January 2011.
The “anything is possible” sensation of the Tahrir Square rebellion had faded, and now two candidates whom the protesters deeply opposed, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, and Ahmed Shafiq, a factotum of the old regime (and of the current military government), prepared to face off in the second round.
The triad of fundamental forces driving Egypt since the beginning of the Arab Spring – the military, the mosque, and the masses in Tahrir Square, each with different types of power and interests – was thus broken.
Those who filled Tahrir Square 16 months ago were silenced, and the expected transfer of power from the military to a civilian, democratic government was thrown into doubt.
Since assuming power after Mubarak’s fall, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, a defense minister for two decades under Mubarak, has consistently undermined the delicate work of democratic transition.
The week before the presidential elections, the SCAF-allied Constitutional Court dissolved the recently elected parliament, alleging illegality in the voting process.
And, foreseeing Morsi’s victory, SCAF assumed all legislative powers; severely limited the president’s powers; seized the authority to appoint the committee tasked with drafting the new Constitution; took control of the country’s budget; and claimed sole power over domestic and foreign security.
As a result, Egypt’s power struggle will continue, with the junta no longer battling those in Tahrir Square, but political Islam.
After a decades-long clandestine (although tolerated) existence within Egyptian society, Islamist forces were able to take advantage of the Tahrir protests, despite playing no integral part in them.
The secular liberal forces’ political fragmentation and lack of organization cost them dearly in the parliamentary elections six months ago, and, in the second round of the presidential election, a majority of Egyptians chose Morsi over a restoration of the old regime.
But Morsi’s narrow margin of victory (just 3.5 percentage points) over Shafiq, and low voter turnout – 46.4% in the first round and 51.8% in the second – reflect a polarized, exhausted society that lacks confidence in the electoral process and the candidates.
Moreover, the outcome has merely fueled further uncertainty about Egypt’s direction.
With Morsi’s victory, some now fear that the Muslim Brotherhood will seek to implement radical policies aimed at Islamizing a Muslim country that is already conservative, but that has had a secular government for decades.
Others do not believe that the Muslim Brotherhood will go so far, but nonetheless doubt that the Brothers will defend a secular, truly democratic regime in the ongoing negotiations with SCAF on a transition to civilian rule.
In either scenario, Morsi has little room to maneuver in a country that, for the time being, is in political limbo – with neither a constitution nor a parliament – and whose people want tangible results in terms of good governance, institutional consolidation, and improvements to a tottering economy.
Indeed, living standards have been under severe pressure since Mubarak’s downfall.
In 2011 alone, net capital inflows fell nearly 90% year on year, tourism was down 30%, the trade deficit soared to $28 billion, and GDP growth slowed from 3.8% to 1%.
The success or failure of Morsi’s government will rest largely on the economy.
For the Muslim Brotherhood, this scenario constitutes a serious challenge, one that can be overcome only by finding an adequate balance between SCAF, with its overweening power, and Egypt’s liberal political forces – which won a combined 11 million votes, five million more than Morsi, in the presidential election’s first round.
Only this will give a Morsi administration the necessary legitimacy and capacity to carry out a joint transition with the military for a true change of regime.
The liberals, for their part, did not support Morsi in the run-off with Shafiq.
But it was their efforts that made the presidential election possible in the first place, and many now believe that close collaboration with the Brothers is the only available option that can restore some of the spirit of an endangered revolution in which they were the protagonists.
This presupposes that the Brothers reorganize themselves internally and find ways to distance themselves from more radical factions, and that they promote inclusive policies toward vulnerable groups and social minorities.
For now, the Brothers have announced that they will name a Christian and a woman as Vice Presidents.
Obviously, that represents an encouraging first step in bridging Egypt’s divides.
But, just as obviously, it is only a first step.

Defusing Iran
BERLIN – On February 18, crucial negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program began in Vienna between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany (the P5+1).
The alternative to the talks is a further nuclear buildup by Iran, followed by additional international sanctions and, eventually, another war in the Middle East, which no one believes can resolve the problem.
So, can a comprehensive agreement that respects Iran’s right to civilian nuclear energy, while allaying the international community’s fears of weaponization, be achieved?
The interim agreement reached last November in Geneva reflected the West’s de facto acceptance that Iran is entitled to carry out limited low-grade uranium enrichment within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The West released about $7 billion of frozen Iranian funds and relaxed some sanctions (in particular, on crude oil and auto parts), while Iran agreed to a quasi-freeze of its nuclear program.
That created the basis for a lasting agreement. But realizing that potential will be difficult.
First and foremost, a mountain of mutual distrust will need to be overcome.
The West and Israel do not believe that Iran’s nuclear program is meant to serve merely civilian aims.
Otherwise, why would Iran invest billions of dollars in a program that is almost tailor-made for military purposes, including long-distance delivery systems?
The Iranian leadership, for its part, remains convinced that the United States still seeks to bring about regime change.
From Iran’s perspective, accepting an American hand extended in a spirit of conciliation could turn it into a fist.
Moreover, any compromise would be fiercely contested within both camps, possibly leading to serious domestic political conflict.
And even if both sides’ current leaderships are sincere, will this hold true for their successors?
The absence of trust between Iran and the West leads directly to the second obstacle to a comprehensive agreement: verification and monitoring.
The central issue in these negotiations, around which everything else revolves, concerns Iran’s “breakout capability” – the time it would need, within the framework of any agreement with the West, to renege and build a nuclear weapon.
How much supervision will be required not just to verify compliance but also to detect any possible attempt at a breakout?
The technical questions are complex, and the proverbial devil really is in the countless details.
But prospects for a deal will hinge on resolving three broad issues.
The first two issues reflect the two paths toward the bomb: uranium enrichment and plutonium production.
Any workable agreement will require Iran to renounce uranium enrichment above the 5% level needed for a civilian nuclear-power program; accept limits on enrichment volumes, the number of centrifuges, and technology; agree to forgo reprocessing; and address operations at the heavy-water reactor in Arak.
The third issue concerns supervision and monitoring, which for quite some time would probably have to go beyond that agreed in the Additional Protocol to the NPT and include certain military installations.
Indeed, the duration the agreement will be of vital importance.
The West wants it to be implemented for as long as possible, while Iran would prefer a very short timeframe within which to achieve its central objectives: a comprehensive and lasting repeal of international sanctions and recognition as an NPT non-military nuclear power.
That raises another important question: Does US President Barack Obama really have a domestic mandate for negotiating a comprehensive repeal of the sanctions?
Here, we are brought back to the central issue in this process: technical questions, though important, are still only an expression of the underlying political conflicts and animosities.
These are the real factors driving the confrontation that the Vienna negotiations are meant to defuse over the next six months.
And the current regional and sectarian confrontation in the Middle East affects the nuclear negotiations directly.
All of the relevant players – including those, like Saudi Arabia and Israel, that are not sitting at the table but whose presence is very much felt – are clinging to their initial positions.
The US does not want Iran to become a military nuclear power or gain regional predominance; above all, the Americans do not want another Middle East war.
Iran, however, wants to become a (non-military?) nuclear power and shape a region in which it is heavily involved militarily (in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq).
Europe shares the US position, but is more flexible.
Saudi Arabia, a Sunni power, wants to stop Shia Iran from becoming an emerging or, worse still, a military nuclear power in the Gulf, and has taken the opposite side in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.
Israel opposes Iran’s becoming a military nuclear power – or even a nuclear-threshold state – and is willing to try to prevent this by military means.
To achieve a sustainable compromise that all sides accept (even if with gritted teeth), the negotiations must be accompanied by diplomatic steps aimed at building trust both in the region and beyond.
Europe is very well versed in such processes and should put its experience to good use.
Iran must decide whether it wants to follow the North Korean route to international isolation, or some variation on the Chinese route to integration into the global economy.
It must also understand that its relationship with both Israel and Saudi Arabia will affect the negotiations, either positive or negatively.
And the West – the US, Europe, and, more than any other country, Israel – will have to get used to the idea of living with an Iranian civilian nuclear-power program, while limiting Iran’s capacity to become an emerging military nuclear power.
As the very different examples of the Soviet Union and China show, the Iranian regime might someday collapse or change fundamentally – probably when hardly anyone expects it.
Until then, we must do our best to defuse the nuclear time bomb together.

Lose-Lose Trade Sanctions
NEW HAVEN – One of the strongest arguments for free trade is that it promotes peace between participating countries.
There is an undeniable correlation between the two, even if it is not always clear whether peace is a pre-condition for the free movement of goods and services, or whether commerce creates the economic incentives for all participants to maintain peace.
Back in 2016, as anti-China rhetoric in the United States grew increasingly shrill, one could not help but feel that we were on the verge of a new cold war.
During Donald Trump’s presidency, the tensions boiled over into something unprecedented in recent history: the weaponization of trade during peacetime.
Recent research shows that the US-China trade war has had substantial economic costs. But the political costs may be even worse.
International cooperation has broken down, multilateral institutions have been disempowered, and the world has entered an era of increasing polarization – both within and across countries.
The best hopes for the future have seemed to lie in regional blocs and alliances, auguring a new, more fractured form of globalization.
There are striking parallels between the current era and the 1930s, when the United Kingdom’s dramatic shift toward protectionism set off a global chain reaction.
Economic historians have argued that this change not only contributed to the decline of international trade in the interwar period, but also made trade more bilateral and regional.
Many observers at the time worried that international rivalries would be exacerbated. They were right: we now refer to this era as the pre-belligerence period ahead of World War II.
A trade war in the 1930s was the harbinger of a military war, and the events leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fit this paradigm.
The war in Ukraine will inevitably lead to a further unraveling of globalization; but it is as much a result of the breakdown of international cooperation as it is a cause.
Would Russian President Vladimir Putin have pursued his war without the assurance of a lifeline from China?
And would China have given Putin a greenlight and risked a further deterioration of its relationship with the West if it had not been relentlessly vilified by American and (to a lesser extent) European politicians?
There can be little doubt that Western policies toward China over the last decade have left that country in a position where it has little international goodwill left to lose.
If China is destined to be the villain in Western political narratives, it may as well do what it thinks is in its best immediate interests.
As the war in Ukraine unfolds, trade policy is being weaponized further as part of the new sanctions regime against Russia.
The explicit objective is to cut off Russia from international markets, isolate it economically, and … then what?
Imposing sanctions on the aggressor may make one feel morally superior – especially when such measures entail real economic costs for the countries that impose them – but that doesn’t mean they will bring an end to the war.
Trade sanctions have a long history.
The West has used similar measures against Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Afghanistan.
In each case, sanctions hurt the people in the countries they targeted but showed little sign of limiting the power or changing the behavior of the countries’ political leaders.
The sanctions against Russia will certainly cause hardship there, impoverishing an emerging middle class that could become a force for reform.
If the goal is to topple Putin, history suggests that this is unlikely to happen in the near term.
Putin’s domestic position may even be strengthened as Russia’s disenfranchised middle class turns inward and embraces nationalism, as has happened in Western democracies over the past decade.
More broadly, sanctions are likely to strengthen the Russia-China alliance, deepen global polarization, and hammer the last nail into the coffin of multilateralism.
The weaponization of trade will also have costs for the wider world, owing to Russia’s importance in energy and food markets.
The economic consequences of various scenarios are difficult to predict, because the reallocation of trade flows and the resulting price movements will depend not only on market forces but also on political decisions.
Still, one thing is certain: as with the trade war between the US and China, there will be political as well as economic costs.
Concessions to current pariah countries (such as Iran or Venezuela) may be inevitable; and even then, the trade sanctions may end up being self-defeating.
Another certainty is that weaponizing trade will not end the conflict.
Western leaders must recognize this and double down on diplomacy.
Russia needs a face-saving way out. One question that is rarely considered fully in the West is why Russia invaded Ukraine.
Certainly, it is about more than one power-hungry autocrat’s delusional ambitions (the standard line in the US). Miscalculation on both sides contributed to the escalation of conflict: Ukraine believed that NATO and EU membership were feasible in the short run and that it could count on the Alliance’s military support; Russia, extrapolating from its largely bloodless annexation of Crimea in 2014, underestimated Ukrainian resistance.
Finding some common ground might seem impossible at the moment. But a negotiated solution is probably the only way to avoid a long-term disaster that would destabilize the entire region, if not the world.
The weaponization of trade is a convenient way for governments to deflect attention from real problems like the economic fallout from the pandemic, widespread demoralization and reluctance among workers, spiraling mental-health crises, and rising debt levels.
There are no easy remedies to these problems. So, why bother with them when you can direct people’s attention to graphic images showing the plight of those who have it worse?
Ultimately, the biggest winners of the war in Ukraine may be self-interested politicians around the world who have found a convenient way to avoid dealing with problems at home.

New Europe’s Old Ghosts
NEW YORK – The past stalked Europe in 2014.
When the year started, the centennial of the Great War’s outbreak attracted much commemorative energy.
But, as it progressed, disturbing parallels appeared – not to 1914, but to some of the nastier features of the interwar years.
From Scotland and Catalonia to the borders of Ukraine, the politics of nationality flared, while Europe’s economy stagnated – hostage to a German inflation phobia that dates back to 1923.
And, as the year unfolded, a new geopolitical tug of war between the continent’s two early-twentieth-century giants, Germany and Russia, became apparent, while Europe’s amnesiac political elite seemed to be fumbling on one front after another.
To anyone who recalls Danzig and the Sudetenland – the endless nationality claims and counter-claims that triggered World War II in the borderlands of Eastern Europe – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s revanchism in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014 has a disturbingly familiar ring to it.
His rhetoric of humiliation and encirclement, the instrumental talk of minority rights, and the Kremlin’s use of local proxies, with all of the uncertainties that accompany reliance on such actors – all of this was reminiscent of nothing so much as interwar Germany’s own irredentist policies.
The politics of nationality is not confined to Eastern Europe.
Scotland’s independence referendum in September threatened to split the United Kingdom.
The same month, up to two million pro-independence Catalans marched through Barcelona, in what may have been the largest demonstration ever seen in Europe.
Ask most Catalans what independence will bring, aside from freedom from Spain, and you won’t get much of an answer: resentment at past wrongs overshadows any serious calculations about the future.
But perhaps the purest reversion to interwar nationalist ideology is occurring just beyond Europe’s borders – in Israel, of all places.
There, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s government has proposed a law enshrining the collective primacy of the country’s Jews – legislation that destroys in spirit and form what little is left of Israel’s founding commitment to equality under the law.
Could there be any sadder demonstration of the cunning of history?
Europe’s past was equally present in the realm of economics in 2014.
Thanks to the European Union’s austerity policies, the eurozone faces the prospect of a Japan-style era of stagnation, and chronic high unemployment on its southern fringe.
The irony is that Germany’s anxieties about price stability, which underlie the EU’s embrace of austerity, are entirely misplaced: German inflation could scarcely be lower.
With German unemployment, too, hitting record lows, while joblessness hits record highs in Italy and remains at obscene levels in Greece and Spain, what has emerged is a two-tier Europe, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government calling the shots.
For now, the periphery countries calculate that the eventual benefits to be gained from remaining within the eurozone will outweigh the current pain of austerity.
For its part, Germany exacts austerity as the price of its participation in the single currency.
It is on this uneasy basis that its hegemony in Europe rests.
Though depoliticization and apathy have held back serious challenges to German dominance, such challenges are emerging.
German policymakers have discounted the rise of extremism in relatively small countries such as Hungary and Greece.
But one wonders how they might respond to spectacular results for Marine Le Pen’s National Front in next year’s French regional elections or in the presidential election in 2017.
And of course the big mystery is Germany itself, seemingly lifted from history by its own economic buoyancy.
Can German politicians abandon Weimar-style economics before they are hit by Weimar-style political disintegration?
And even if they manage this eventually, will Germany have lost much of Europe in the meantime?
This brings us to the nascent but unmistakable signs of a Russo-German rift.
If Franco-German rivalry shaped the era between 1870 and 1920, it was the conflict with Russia that defined the next 70 years.
That conflict was forgotten for two decades after the end of the Cold War, because Russia’s internal travails and Germany’s desire to demonstrate its post-unification harmlessness kept both powers from flexing their muscles.
Now that Putin has made muscle-flexing his main form of diplomacy – not merely in Ukraine and the Baltic states, but also in the Balkans and the North Sea – it has fallen to Germany to shape Europe’s response.
The motive today is not to defend ethnic Germans abroad – their expulsion in the millions in the 1940s ended that particular concern – so much as the more laudable desire to preserve the values of a democratic EU against the new authoritarianism from the East.
Whether Germany can continue to perform this role, however, will depend on what kind of EU emerges over the next few years.
In particular, if Europe is to succeed with Germany at the helm, Germans and everyone else will have to break more decisively with the past than they have managed to do so far.

Russia’s Looming Defeat in Ukraine
WASHINGTON, DC – It is easy to see who is losing the most from the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Ukrainian civilians, victims of war crimes and missile terror, and the millions around the world for whom food is now more expensive, because Russia has until recently been blocking Ukrainian grain shipments through the Black Sea (and launching strikes on Ukrainian ports even after agreeing to a ceasefire).
But who exactly is winning from this dreadful conflict?
The Russian authorities are behaving as if things are going well for them.
Their tone is arrogant, and they respond to entreaties with disdain.
Their media proxies threaten to blow up Europe one day and, when rebuked, to destroy the world the next day.
And now Russia is choking off the supply of natural gas to Europe – throwing its weight around as if victory is just around the corner.
But all of this is just a bizarre delusion.
In fact, Russia is losing the war badly in both military and economic terms.
On the military front, the Russian position looks increasingly dire.
After suffering a catastrophic defeat in its initial attempt to take Kyiv and Kharkiv, in recent months the Russians gained some territory in the Donbas region.
But this advance was entirely due to massive artillery bombardment.
Now that the Ukrainians have longer-range artillery, this Russian advantage is dwindling rapidly.
Kherson, in southern Ukraine, provides an instructive example.
The Russians have positioned an army group on the western side of the Dnipro River, supplied primarily over a big bridge, which long-range Ukrainian missile strikes recently rendered unusable.
No supplies, ammunition, or fresh troops can reach the stranded Russian forces.
This looks like a turning point.
Another big defeat looms on the economic front.
The pre-invasion Russian economy was based on energy exports – oil, gas, and coal, in that order of importance – supported by foreign direct investment and a flow of people and ideas that had deepened greatly over the past three decades.
All of this is fading fast.
Western companies are pulling out their skilled people and technology.
Sanctions on coal exports are beginning to bite.
And now the Russians are starting a self-destructive confrontation with Europe by weaponizing its exports of natural gas.
Perhaps the major Russian achievement since the end of the Cold War was to persuade Germany and other parts of Europe that it could be trusted as a long-term partner in the supply of gas.
This trust is now destroyed.
No one in Europe should want to rely on Russian energy supplies for decades, or perhaps for as long as the world uses fossil fuels.
Very soon, Russia will have just one major export: crude oil.
For a renegade state, crude oil is an ideal resource.
It can be loaded onto a tanker and sold anywhere in the world.
Much of this market is already shady, and many customers, for example in India and China, prefer not to ask too many questions.
But Russia is a big oil exporter – attempting to move around four million barrels of crude per day by sea.
A decent-sized tanker can carry about one million barrels, and it takes about 20 days to move it from Ust-Luga (an important Russian port in the Baltics) to the west coast of India.
The Russians need to mobilize a vast fleet – hundreds of tankers – along with all the financial services needed to support these transactions.
And they need this fleet to operate 24/7, without disruption.
To keep its economy functioning, Russia needs to organize something akin to the 1948-49 Berlin Airlift – except this time the task is lifting oil by sea out of Russia, and not for two years, but forever.
According to industry sources, around half of all suitable oil tankers are owned or controlled by European and other Western companies.
Most of the trade finance and insurance used in these transactions is run out of the European Union, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan.
Instead of trying to cut off these transactions, the G7 has proposed a more robust approach: companies would be allowed to participate in moving Russian oil, but only if all involved agreed to pay no more than a capped price.
Russia already accepts a substantial discount – the latest estimates for Urals crude are up to $20 per barrel below the price of the Brent benchmark.
The pre-invasion discount was close to zero.
Now the West is effectively pushing to increase this discount – creating a dial that can be turned to tighten the squeeze on Putin’s revenue.
When the price cap was first proposed, some commentators predicted it would drive up the world price of oil – but prices have subsequently fallen.
Other observers suggested that the market would not cooperate – but oil traders and banks seem keen to continue doing business in an approved fashion.
And some people fretted that not all the details were immediately in place – as if that ever happens with major policy breakthroughs.
The noose is tightening around Kherson – entirely the result of Russian aggression and over-confidence.
And it is tightening around Russian oil revenues and the Russian economy for the same reasons.

The Migration Superpowers
LONDON – We have entered the age of migration.
If all the people who live outside the country of their birth united to form their own – a republic of the rootless – it would be the fifth-largest country in the world, with a population of more than 240 million people.
Though much has been written about how a world on the move is changing national politics, there has been little consideration of its geopolitical effects.
But the mass movement of people is already creating three types of migration superpowers: new colonialists, integrators, and go-betweens.
The new colonialists call to mind the settlers from Europe who spread across the world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, benefiting not just themselves, but also their homelands.
Similarly, the most mobile populations of the twenty-first century are helping their countries of origin obtain access to markets, technology, and a political voice in the world.
The American journalist Howard W. French describes how Africa has become “China’s second continent,” as more than a million new Chinese settlers remake Sub-Saharan Africa.
With more Chinese citizens living outside mainland China than there are French people living in France, a similar story is playing out on almost every continent.
When those migrants return to China, their capabilities are expertly harvested.
Known in China as “sea turtles,” they dominate their country’s technology industry.
India, too, has a large diaspora of an estimated 20 million citizens who are super-successful and hyper-connected.
Indian-born entrepreneurs are responsible for setting up one in ten companies in Silicon Valley.
Microsoft’s chief executive is of Indian origin, as is the inventor of the Intel Pentium processor, the former chief technology officer at Motorola, and the CEO of Google.
How does this benefit India?
For starters, India receives more than $70 billion in remittances every year, the largest sum worldwide, amounting to nearly 4% of its GDP, which is more than it spends on education.
And while it may not be possible to prove a causal connection, the influx of Indians into America has coincided with a shift in both countries’ geopolitical orientations, as evidenced by the historic 2008 nuclear deal by which the US abandoned its policy of equidistance between India and Pakistan.
With so many people on the move, it is even possible to become a settler superpower without being recognized as a state.
The estimated 35 million Kurds – who regard themselves as a nation without a country – are becoming one of the most politically active migrant populations in Europe.
It is likely no coincidence that the governments of Sweden and Germany, with their large populations of Kurdish origin, are providing militarily support to the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against the Islamic State (ISIS).
The second type of superpower is the integrator.
Libraries could be filled with books about how the United States has benefited from its ability to transform people from around the world into American citizens.
Similarly, Angola and Brazil have reversed the brain drain and are receiving large flows of immigrants from their former colonial ruler, Portugal.
But the two most eye-catching experiments in integration today are Israel and ISIS.
Immigration from the diaspora is essential to Israel, which is reflected in the Hebrew word for it: aliyah, derived from the verb “to ascend.”
Indeed, the government provides “aliyah consultants,” as well as free one-way flights, language classes, and practical support.
As a result, Israel’s population has risen ninefold since the country’s founding in 1948.
In Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle, co-authored with Saul Singer, the American writer and political adviser Dan Senor poses a fundamental question.
“How is it,” he asks, “that Israel – a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources – produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom?”
The answer, of course, is immigration.
ISIS’s leaders would not be happy with the comparison, but their group’s rapid emergence on the map has drawn some lessons from Israel.
The so-called Islamic State may not be officially recognized by anyone, but it is being built on the basis of immigration.
According to the Soufan Group, roughly 30,000 people from 86 countries have traveled to ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq.
The third type of immigration superpowers are go-betweens, which use their geography to extract concessions from migration-phobic neighbors.
The most notable example is Turkey; once forced to beg to be considered for European Union membership, it now dictates the terms of its relationship with Brussels.
A leaked transcript of a recent summit with European leaders revealed how President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatened to bus refugees to Greece and Bulgaria if his demands were not met.
Niger is another go-between.
As a major transit hub through which 90% of all West African migrants pass on their way to Italy, Niger succeeded in securing €600 million ($680 million) in the last EU aid budget.
In doing so, it followed the example of Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, who famously warned that Europe would “turn black” if it did not pay him to hold back migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean.
If the established powers that first benefited from the globalization of trade are known as the G-7, the countries, regions, and organizations that are benefiting from migration – China, India, Kurdistan, Israel, ISIS, Turkey, and Niger – could be called the M-7.
As control over population flows become a currency of power, states that follow the M-7’s lead will have the opportunity to boost their geopolitical heft.
For the West, the biggest challenge will be to reconcile domestic pressure for closed borders with the geopolitical advantages of embracing migration.
For now, at least, it seems that the G-7 – for which an easily affordable influx of refugees has somehow become a “crisis” – will continue to aid the M-7’s rise.

Democratizing Innovation
CAMBRIDGE – Innovation is the engine that drives contemporary economies.
Living standards are determined by productivity growth, which in turn depends on the introduction and dissemination of new technologies that allow an ever-wider variety of goods and services to be produced with fewer and fewer of our planet’s resources.
Policymakers and the public at large understand the importance of innovation.
What is less well appreciated is the degree to which the innovation agenda has been captured by narrow groups of investors and firms whose values and interests don’t necessarily reflect society’s needs.
In today’s advanced economies, private firms undertake the bulk of research and development.
The business sector’s share of total R&D spending ranges from 60% in Singapore to 78% in South Korea, with the United States closer to the higher end, at 72%.
But it is the public sector that provides the essential social, legal, and educational infrastructure that sustains private R&D.
Innovation in the private sector depends crucially on government funding of basic science and research labs.
It relies on scientific talent trained in universities supported by public funds.
The state provides innovators with monopoly rights through the patent system, and ensures the private appropriation of returns to R&D through labor and contract law.
Not least, private R&D is heavily subsidized by the state through tax credits and other policies.
As a society, we should care not just about how much innovation takes place, but also about the types of new technologies that are developed.
We ought to ensure we are investing in technologies that are safe, environmentally sound, empower rather than simply replace human labor, and are consistent with democratic values and human rights.
The direction of technological change is not fixed or determined from outside the social and economic system.
Instead, it is shaped by incentives, values, and the distribution of power.
Despite the state’s heavy involvement in supporting innovation, governments typically pay remarkably little attention to the direction technological change takes in private hands.
But private firms’ priorities often lead them to under-invest in technologies that have significant long-run returns, such as those that reduce climate change, or to pay inadequate attention to the human-rights or privacy implications of digital innovations.
Pharmaceutical companies, for example, seek returns in high-priced medicines for rare diseases affecting advanced economies, instead of vaccines for tropical diseases affecting millions in poor countries.
Moreover, firms tend to over-invest in automation in order to increase the return to capital and managers, at the expense of employees.
As the economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo have noted, this may result in “so-so technologies” which produce few overall productivity benefits, while leaving workers worse off.
The common fixation with automation can lead the smartest investors astray.
In 2016, Elon Musk announced that Tesla’s Model 3 would be built in a new, fully automated car factory, which would operate at speeds exceeding what is feasible for humans.
Two years later, the plans had floundered, and severe bottlenecks at the new factory made clear actual production would fall far short of the company’s targets.
Musk was forced to set up a new assembly line – full of human workers – on the factory grounds.
“Humans are underrated,” he conceded on Twitter.
Innovators’ priorities are naturally shaped by their own cultural and social milieu.
In a recent paper, Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner and Ramana Nanda have quantified how distant their values and priorities may be from those of ordinary people.
In the US, venture capital (VC) plays a disproportionate role in financing innovation by startups.
The VC industry is highly concentrated, with the top 5% of investors accounting for 50% of the capital raised.
Three regions – the San Francisco Bay Area, Greater New York, and Greater Boston – account for about two-thirds of the industry and over 90% of top firms’ corporate board membership.
The top VC firms’ influence goes even further, because they often act as gatekeepers for other investors.
The social and educational background of those who make the investment decisions is equally homogeneous.
Lerner and Nanda report that three-quarters of partners with at least one board seat in top VC firms attended an Ivy League university, Caltech, MIT, or Stanford.
Nearly a third are graduates of just two business schools (Harvard and Stanford).
It would be surprising if the funding decisions taken were not influenced by the social composition of the group.
Lerner and Nanda suggest that the geographic concentration of VC firms may have contributed to the “hollowing out” of innovative activities in other parts of the country.
“Venture firms based in other cities,” they argue, “might have chosen very different firms to invest in given their perspectives on their local economies.”
Biased priorities prevail in public innovation programs as well.
The largest single program supporting high-tech innovation in the US is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which as the name indicates, is oriented toward military applications.
While many DARPA projects have yielded civilian benefits as well (not least the Internet and GPS), agency priorities are clearly shaped by defense considerations.
DARPA’s clean-energy technologies counterpart, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), has barely a tenth the budget.
Perhaps the biggest omission is that no government currently has programs devoted specifically to funding the development of labor-friendly technologies.
If technological innovation is to serve society, the direction it takes must reflect social priorities.
Governments have evaded their responsibility here, because of the pervasive belief that it is difficult to alter the course of technology.
But we have not tried nearly enough to steer technology in the right directions.
Innovation is too important to leave to innovators alone.

Getting Serious About Leveling Up
LONDON – Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a speech in Coventry about what seems to have become his signature policy initiative: “leveling up” the local and regional economies that have increasingly fallen behind that of London and the United Kingdom’s southeast.
Having previously chaired the independent commission that gave rise to Prime Minister David Cameron’s Northern Powerhouse plan, I remain heavily focused on the same goal.
The original commission had looked into the disjointed pattern of urban growth across the UK.
After we released our recommendations, I was invited by Cameron and then-Chancellor George Osborne to serve as the Northern Powerhouse minister in the Treasury; and since leaving government in 2016, I have been a vice chair of the independent Northern Powerhouse Partnership.
Moreover, I recently became the chair of Northern Gritstone, a new private “patient capital” firm that will invest in start-ups emerging from northern English universities, primarily (but not limited to) those of Leeds, Manchester, and Sheffield.
While these institutions regularly rank among the top 200 in the world, they are located in low-productivity areas that suffer from a scarcity of fast-growing, high-earning businesses.
That means there are ample opportunities for investment.
In his speech, Johnson alluded to a forthcoming white paper on his government’s plans for leveling up.
If and when that document comes, one hopes that it will offer a clear definition of success and a coherent strategy for achieving it.
As Johnson noted in his speech, the gap between the UK’s most and least prosperous areas has been growing.
“It is an astonishing fact,” he observed, “that 31 years after German unification, the per capita GDP of the North East of our country, Yorkshire, the East Midlands, Wales, and Northern Ireland is now lower than in what was formerly East Germany.”
Though Johnson can reel off many powerful examples to illustrate the UK’s shocking inequalities, his proposals for solving the problem are less impressive.
Based on what we have seen, it is hardly surprising that so many commentators are skeptical.
Obviously, nobody opposes the basic idea of “leveling up” the UK economy.
The question is how it will be done, and how progress will be measured.
Is Johnson’s government focusing merely on per capita GDP, with victory to be declared when people in the northeast are earning as much on average as people in London?
This wouldn’t do, because, as Johnson notes, large parts of Greater London have also fallen dramatically behind the capital’s more successful areas.
If leveling up is to be achieved without leveling down anyone else, boosting per capita GDP across Greater London would create an even larger gap between London and the northeast.
Further complicating matters is the issue of living standards.
There are massive differences in house prices depending on where one looks.
Residents of the southeast – notably of places like Cambridge – may pay so much for housing that their real disposable incomes are below those of others who earn less elsewhere.
Instead of targeting only per capita GDP, perhaps the government could focus on life expectancy.
Some of Johnson’s most vivid anecdotes highlight the shocking geographical differences in how long people typically live.
But it is unclear how, precisely, this public policy would target this metric.
In any case, given that the same party that controlled the previous two governments – including the one that introduced the Northern Powerhouse plan – is still in power, allow me to share what I think the forthcoming white paper should spell out.
First, the government needs to explain how it will measure progress and success.
In my view, a better choice than per capita GDP would be regional productivity, because this both correlates strongly with per capita GDP and captures a range of other desirable social objectives.
I would also like to see the Johnson government link its goals to those of its predecessors and offer a foundation upon which future governments can build.
In one of Johnson’s earliest speeches as prime minister, he announced a plan to introduce a “Northern Powerhouse Growth Board.”
But this ambition has apparently vanished; in fact, the words “northern powerhouse” did not appear even once in his latest speech.
Similarly, while Johnson and his ministers have previously spoken with gusto about introducing Northern Powerhouse Rail, that project wasn’t mentioned, either, even when the speech touched directly on infrastructure and trains.
That omission would seem to confirm rumors that the government is abandoning the NPR project, just as it did the growth board.
Johnson also appears suddenly to be favoring small towns rather than big urban areas.
This might be politically expedient, but it will not necessarily help to improve national performance.
If leveling up the UK economy is the objective, the government will need to bring all regions’ productivity up to the same level as London’s.
Here, it could consult the recommendations of the 2013-14 RSA City Growth Commission, which examined urban areas with at least 500,000 inhabitants.
A final crucial factor is education.
Johnson listed many failures in this domain, and it is the area that most economists would put first in a strategy to achieve sustained productivity growth and socioeconomic fairness.
But the government’s ambitions seem to be limited to advocating academies (government-funded independent schools) and recruitment of better teachers.
It is blatantly obvious to everyone who works in, or relies on, the education sector that much more is needed to help left-behind areas.
Let us hope that the coming white paper offers a proper policy framework, with targets for which the government can be held to account.
To level up the UK economy, Johnson must first level up rhetoric and substance.

The End of History Comes to Tunisia
PARIS – Tunisia’s “Jasmine Revolution” is still unfolding, but we can already read into it lessons about democracy and democratization that extend far beyond the Maghreb.
To set the Jasmine Revolution in historical perspective, we must recall June 4, 1989 – that pivotal Sunday when the Poles voted the communists out of power and, at the other end of Eurasia, the Communist Party of China crushed a burgeoning democratic movement on Tiananmen Square.
In retrospect, that day looks like a fork in the road of human history.
One path led to the demise of communism and a new birth of freedom and democracy – at times bloody and painful – in Europe.
The other path traced an alternative course, with China remaining under the grip of its ruling party, but delivering prosperity to its impoverished masses through astounding and sustained growth.
As the revolutionary year of 1989 was unfolding, Francis Fukuyama, presciently yet controversially pondered whether the path chosen in Europe heralded the “end of history.”
Following Hegel, Fukuyama made the case that history is directional – that it is leading somewhere – for two reasons.
First, the ceaseless spread of technology and of the economic liberal order, which has a homogenizing effect.
Second, the Hegelian “struggle for recognition” has been a pervasive driving force of mankind, powerful enough to lead countless individuals to the ultimate sacrifice.
But, while a widespread consensus held that communism was nothing but a dead end, China’s economic success, and the authoritarian backlash in Russia following Boris Yeltsin’s departure from the Kremlin a decade ago, prompted a more pessimistic analysis.
Theories of “democratic rollback” and of a resurgence of “authoritarian great powers” surfaced to unveil the potential of systems that combined nationalism and state-led growth-yielding capitalism.
Some argued that authoritarian rule provided a much surer and safer path to welfare than democracy could offer, others extolled the virtues of “Asian values,” and still others argued that democracy in the Arab or Muslim world would only pave the way for Islamic fundamentalists to take power.
Not surprisingly, autocrats everywhere embraced such views.
But the message of Tunisia’s Jasmine Revolution rings loud and clear: democracy – and the liberal political order in which it is rooted – is not merely a Western concept (or a Western conspiracy), but holds universal attraction, powered by the craving for “recognition.”
Moreover, it can be accessed at an early stage of a country’s modernization.
To be sure, authoritarian rule can manage the early stages of industrialization.
But a “knowledge economy” cannot operate with muzzled minds.
Even the smartest authoritarian rulers are unable to manage complexity on this scale – not to mention the corruption that inevitably breeds in the protected shadows of autocracy.
Challenging the “myth of the autocratic revival,” the American political scientists Daniel Deudney and John Ikenberry have examined China and Russia, finding “little evidence for the emergence of a stable equilibrium between capitalism and autocracy such that this combination could be dignified as a new model of modernity.”
While neither country qualifies as a liberal democracy, both “are much more liberal and democratic than they have ever been, and many of the crucial foundations for sustainable liberal democracy are emerging” – one main hurdle being the centrifugal forces that democracy might unleash.
But most countries that are unburdened by such a threat have, quietly or spectacularly, rallied to the liberal order over the past decades.
Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia have done so without being hampered by their supposed “Asian values.”
Similarly, Latin America, once the playground of myriad juntas and golpes, is now largely anchored in political liberalism.
Turkey is ruled by a mildly Islamist party that plays by the rules of democracy.
And, in the spring of 2009, the presidential campaign in Iran evinced a formidable craving for freedom.
What is obvious from these cases is that development activates the two channels that Fukuyama identifies as shaping the direction of history: cumulative economic and technological change and the desire for recognition.
Both foster individual empowerment, which is the gateway to freedom and democracy.
The paths differ between countries, setbacks are not uncommon, and it can take decades, but the leap can occur when the circumstances are ripe – as in Tunisia.
Indeed, the Jasmine Revolution embodies all the tenets of the liberal political order that the West has been advocating since the Atlantic Charter of 1941: a yearning for freedom, opportunity, and the rule of law.
Moreover, Tunisia’s revolution was indigenous, not imported as part of some forcible regime change.
The Tunisian people, led by a frustrated middle class that refused to be cowed, thus provide a healthy reminder of the steady and compelling forces driving the behavior of individuals and nations nowadays.
They illustrate the catalytic effect of digital connectivity (clearly visible, too, among China’s “twittering classes”).
And they might embolden other Arab peoples, as may be happening in Egypt, to force accountability upon their rulers.
Whatever the outcome in Tunisia, those who believe that democracy, to paraphrase Woodrow Wilson, makes the world a safe place – and that more democracy makes it safer – have every reason to rejoice at such an auspicious development.

Another Asian Wake-Up Call
NEW HAVEN – For the second time in three years, global economic recovery is at risk.
In 2008, it was all about the subprime crisis made in America.
Today, it is the sovereign-debt crisis made in Europe.
The alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear across Asia – an export-led region that cannot afford to ignore repeated shocks to its two largest sources of external demand.
Indeed, both of these shocks will have long-lasting repercussions.
In the United States, the American consumer (who still accounts for 71% of US GDP) remains in the wrenching throes of a Japanese-like balance-sheet recession.
In the 15 quarters since the beginning of 2008, real consumer spending has increased at an anemic 0.4% average annual rate.
Never before has America, the world’s biggest consumer, been so weak for so long.
Until US households make greater progress in reducing excessive debt loads and rebuilding personal savings – a process that could take many more years if it continues at its recent snail-like pace – a balance-sheet-constrained US economy will remain hobbled by exceedingly slow growth.
A comparable outcome is likely in Europe.
Even under the now seemingly heroic assumption that the eurozone will survive, the outlook for the European economy is bleak.
The crisis-torn peripheral economies – Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and even Spain – are already in recession.
And economic growth is threatened in the once-solid core of Germany and France, with leading indicators – especially sharply declining German orders data – flashing ominous signs of incipient weakness.
Moreover, with fiscal austerity likely to restrain aggregate demand in the years ahead, and with capital-short banks likely to curtail lending – a serious problem for Europe’s bank-centric system of credit intermediation – a pan-European recession seems inevitable.
The European Commission recently slashed its 2012 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% – teetering on the brink of outright recession.
The risks of further cuts to the official outlook are high and rising.
It is difficult to see how Asia can remain an oasis of prosperity in such a tough global climate.
Yet denial is deep, and momentum is seductive.
After all, Asia has been on such a roll in recent years that far too many believe that the region can shrug off almost anything that the rest of the world dishes out.
If only it were that easy.
If anything, Asia’s vulnerability to external shocks has intensified.
On the eve of the Great Recession of 2008-2009, exports had soared to a record 44% of combined GDP for Asia’s emerging markets – fully ten percentage points higher than the export share prevailing during Asia’s own crisis in 1997-1998.
So, while post-crisis Asia focused in the 2000’s on repairing the financial vulnerabilities that had wreaked such havoc – namely, by amassing huge foreign-exchange reserves, turning current-account deficits into surpluses, and reducing its outsize exposure to short-term capital inflows – it failed to rebalance its economy’s macro structure.
In fact, Asia became more reliant on exports and external demand for economic growth.
As a result, when the shock of 2008-2009 hit, every economy in the region either experienced a sharp slowdown or fell into outright recession.
A similar outcome cannot be ruled out in the months ahead.
After tumbling sharply in 2008-2009, the export share of emerging Asia is back up to its earlier high of around 44% of GDP – leaving the region just as exposed to an external-demand shock today as it was heading into the subprime crisis three years ago.
China – long the engine of the all-powerful Asian growth machine – typifies Asia’s potential vulnerability to such shocks from the developed economies.
Indeed, Europe and the US, combined, accounted for fully 38% of total Chinese exports in 2010 – easily its two largest foreign markets.
The recent data leave little doubt that Asia is now starting to feel the impact of the latest global shock.
As was the case three years ago, China is leading the way, with annual export growth plummeting in October 2011, to 16%, from 31% in October 2010 – and likely to slow further in coming months.
In Hong Kong, exports actually contracted by 3% in September – the first year-on-year decline in 23 months.
Similar trends are evident in sharply decelerating exports in Korea and Taiwan.
Even in India – long thought to be among Asia’s most shock-resistant economies – annual export growth plunged from 44% in August 2011 to just 11% in October.
As was true three years ago, many hope for an Asian “decoupling” – that this high-flying region will be immune to global shocks.
But, with GDP growth now slowing across Asia, that hope appears to be wishful thinking.
The good news is that a powerful investment-led impetus should partly offset declining export growth and allow Asia’s landing to be soft rather than hard.
All bets would be off, however, in the event of a eurozone breakup and a full-blown European implosion.
This is Asia’s second wake-up call in three years, and this time the region needs to take the warning seriously.
With the US, and now Europe, facing long roads to recovery, Asia’s emerging economies can no longer afford to count on solid growth in external demand from the advanced countries to sustain economic development.
Unless they want to settle for slower growth, lagging labor absorption, and heightened risk of social instability, they must move aggressively to shift focus to the region’s own 3.5 billion consumers.
The need for a consumer-led Asian rebalancing has never been greater.

Obama Steps Up
WASHINGTON, DC – For the past six years, US President Barack Obama's administration has, more often than not, sided with the interests of big banks on financial-sector policy.
But this week, announcing a new proposal to prevent conflicts of interest in financial advising, Obama seemed to turn an important corner.
From the outset of his first presidential term, Obama maintained the approach taken by George W. Bush's administration.
Large financial firms benefited from the provision of massive government support in early 2009, and their executives and shareholders received generous terms.
Citigroup, in particular, benefited from this approach, which allowed it to carry on with substantially the same business model and management team.
And the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation of 2010 could have done much more to curtail large banks' power and limit the damage they can cause.
Most recently, in December 2014, the administration abandoned an important part of the Dodd-Frank reforms – a move that directly benefited Citigroup by allowing its management team to take on more risk (of the kind that almost broke the financial system in 2007-08).
Among financial-industry lobbyists and House Republicans, the knives are out to roll back more of the constraints imposed on Citigroup and other big banks.
But now, in an abrupt and commendable turnabout, the Obama administration put the issue of conflicts of interest in the financial sector firmly on the table.
The specific context involves the investment advice given to people saving for retirement.
The decisions these savers must make are complex and can have profound consequences.
Getting it right is difficult even under the best of circumstances.
What will interest rates be?
How long will you and your spouse live?
What will your commitments to your children be, and for how long?
But perhaps the most important question is whether you can trust your financial adviser.
Some financial advisers in the United States are paid not on the basis of how their clients do, but according to what financial products they persuade them to buy.
Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a pro-reform group, recently summed up the current situation well: “[A]dvisers can recommend investments that generate lucrative commissions for them, even though their clients get stuck with high fees, subpar performance, and unacceptably risky products."
Kelleher has been an effective critic of the administration in recent years, pushing long and hard to address all potential conflicts of interest in finance.
And now his analysis and recommendations are being echoed in a new report issued by the Council of Economic Advisers. “Such fee structures," the CEA warns, “generate acute conflicts of interest: the best recommendation for the saver may not be the best recommendation for the adviser's bottom line."
And the CEA goes further, estimating that conflicted investment advice leads to a one-percentage-point drop in return.
In today's low-interest-rate environment, that's a huge potential loss.
(The actual impact will also depend on what happens to equity prices in the coming years.)
The CEA report provides a useful primer on the issues and data.
I wish they weighed in more frequently on finance-related issues, rather than deferring to the US Treasury.
Or they could just listen to Senator Elizabeth Warren as she speaks out repeatedly on a broad range of financial-reform issues.
(Warren joined Obama in unveiling the proposal to protect retirement savers.)
Not surprisingly, at least some people at the US Securities and Exchange Commission have reacted negatively – this is stepping onto their turf, after all.
And the lobbyists are, naturally, out in full force.
But with sufficient White House willpower, the administration can see this through.
What is needed is a change in the rules set by the Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over retirement-related issues.
No doubt industry defenders will claim that current practices benefit small investors – a point disputed directly by the CEA.
The broader and more interesting question is: Where are the statesmen in the financial industry?
Where are the leaders who push for a race to the top, by better serving their clients' best interests?
Jack Bogle, who built his investment-management company, the Vanguard Group, on exactly this principle, with a clear focus on lower fees at every opportunity, has come out strongly in favor of the administration's proposal.
Unfortunately, his remains a lonely voice.
Everyone who provides investment advice to retirement savers should act solely in their clients' best interests.
And, judging by the high number of distinguished and honorable professionals in the industry, many advisers, if not most, already do.
But there also are too many people being exploited, which harms them individually and discourages savings more broadly.
That is why the law should be amended to eliminate as many potential conflicts of interest as possible, by requiring all retirement advisers to act in their clients' best interests at all times.
Such a requirement would be a promising start, but there is still a long way to go.
All retail investors, not just retirement savers, deserve the same legal protection.
Until they get it, the best investment advice may be to assess your adviser carefully, bearing in mind a well-tested performance metric: “Where are the customers' yachts?"

Saving Italy From Itself
SIENA – Now that Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s credibility is weakening at home, he will need all the friends he can get to clear the hurdle of a constitutional referendum in December – and thereby avoid likely political disruption.
Renzi will need the support not just of his own party, which is deeply divided over the referendum, but also of an Italian electorate that has grown disillusioned with politics in general.
The referendum has become a litmus test for Renzi and his government partly because of his ill-considered warning earlier this year that he would resign if the proposed reform of the Senate (the parliament’s upper house) were voted down.
But Renzi’s bigger problem is that he is a mid-term, unelected prime minister who promised, in 2014, to bring change to a country that has heard it all before.
Two years later, far less change than expected has materialized, and Renzi has come to resemble a guarantor of political stability more than a rottamatore – a “scraper of the old,” as he had been nicknamed.
Renzi has vigorously backpedaled from his conditional vow to step down; but if voters reject the Senate reform, he will become a lame duck, and political stability will most likely suffer unless he keeps his promise.
Renzi is an astute politician who understands and speaks to many voters’ gut feelings about the two main issues on their minds: the state of the economy and immigration.
So he knows that his government’s survival – and his own political future – depends on their trust in his ability to address both.
There is no guarantee that he will succeed.
Italy’s economy started the year with strong exports and positive growth, but it has since lost momentum: for the first time since 2014, the economy recorded zero growth in the second quarter, and full-year GDP growth is now expected to be a modest 0.8%. That is far below what Italy needs to make up for the economy’s 5% contraction between 2005 and 2015.
Simply put, Italy’s economic malaise stems from the country’s inability to live with the euro.
The economy has always needed radical supply-side and public-administration reforms to cope with eurozone-membership constraints – both fiscal and monetary.
And yet no government, not even those of Silvio Berlusconi, which held comfortable parliamentary majorities, could accomplish more than piecemeal reforms in specific areas, such as pensions.
Lacking a framework to adjust to new economic realities, Italian real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth has suffered, averaging just 0.3% per year from 1999 to 2015.
During this period, real wages and employment were hit hard – almost 37% of young people and 19% of people in southern Italy are unemployed – and as many as 1.5 million young Italians have left the country, with 90,000 departing in 2014 alone. Meanwhile, five million foreign immigrants have arrived, constituting 8.3% of all residents (and not including undocumented immigrants).
Many Italians blame German-inspired fiscal austerity for their country’s economic malaise; and opposition parties such as the right-wing Northern League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement want Italy to leave the euro, redenominate, and devalue to regain competitiveness.
Just 20 years ago, Italians willingly agreed to pay a one-off tax to bring the fiscal deficit into compliance with eurozone rules.
Today, an estimated 35-40% of Italians want out.
But Italians are torn between antipathy toward the European Union, which disciplines the Italian government, and discontent and frustration with that government itself, owing to its failure to present a credible reform plan.
Because there is no clear villain, an Italian version of the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum is implausible.
In an August opinion poll, only 28% of respondents supported leaving the EU; in a May survey, as many Italians wanted “more Europe” as wanted “less Europe.”
Italy’s upcoming constitutional referendum cannot plausibly be compared to June’s Brexit vote.
In Italy, the referendum is required by the constitution – it did not come about through political machinations – and it is not a vote on EU membership, even if the EU or the eurozone will be on voters’ minds.
Still, the referendum could have far-reaching implications that would spill over into Europe.
The political uncertainty likely to result if voters reject the Senate reform would adversely affect Italy’s struggling economy.
International investors have come around to Renzi, believing that he strikes the right balance between dynamism and stability needed to bring Italy out of its torpor.
They have tolerated his exuberance and even his mistakes (for example, in his management of the country’s banking crisis).
They are underwriting the narrative that Renzi is the only person who can save Italy from itself; that may be the right bet – at least for the time being.

A Window of Opportunity for European Defense
MADRID – With budgets exceptionally tight in Europe nowadays, worries about European defense have been growing.
Paradoxically, however, developments in 2010 offer hope for the future.
The defense agreement signed in November by France and the United Kingdom is composed of two treaties, which cover joint deployment of their armed forces, nuclear deterrence, and improved equipment and communications.
This initiative has the firm political backing of both countries’ leaders, and expresses a clear determination to unite against common threats.
Implemented correctly, these treaties could become a hopeful precedent for the entire European Union.
By transcending strictly national limits, these treaties chart the future path of European defense and will help determine the course of Europe’s relations with the United States and NATO.
To better judge the treaties’ worth, we must remember the context in which they were conceived.
In 1998, the Saint Malo Declaration by French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair indicated both countries’ determination to reinforce the EU’s security and defense capabilities.
Originally reluctant to accept a Europe with autonomous military capacity, the United Kingdom had learned from the intervention in Kosovo that the EU must be able to respond to crises rapidly and efficiently.
The Saint Malo Declaration signaled that the EU’s leading military powers were prepared to develop their own defense policy, though one not fully autonomous of NATO.
Indeed, through the Berlin Plus agreements, which facilitate use of NATO resources for missions undertaken under the European Defense and Security Policy (ESDP), NATO recognized the ESDP’s maturation over the past decade.
Indeed, the EU has undertaken 24 missions in Europe, Africa, and Asia, differing in nature, scope, and aims, and combining military and civilian means.
Today, the EU is being asked to conduct complex missions in adverse circumstances.
In doing so, Europe must draw on the lessons of its past successes.
We Europeans need to respond favorably, quickly, and effectively. Defense missions must be more adaptable, prompt, multinational, and multi-instrumental.
They must be focused on stability and security, regardless of the security situation or the nature of the conflict.
Yet it is clear that European defense is now struggling mightily with public financing.
Moreover, the latest Eurobarometer poll shows that defense is the last thing that Europeans are worried about.
It is precisely here that the Franco-British agreement becomes vitally important.
The treaties mark an attempt to balance action and ambition in a context of economic crisis, fiscal consolidation, large-scale defense transformations, increasing interdependencies, and global threats – from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to climate change, resource scarcity, and epidemics – that are impossible to tackle unilaterally.
It also sets a precedent for the UK, preparing the way for future prime ministers to make advances in this direction.
Reinforcing both countries’ military capacities indirectly reinforces those of the EU. The quest for synergies and efficiency that is implied by the agreement could well become a driving force for the European Defense Agency.
The British may now consider the EDA a defense expenditure, but, when better defined, it could represent a source of savings for every EU country.
Moreover, the agreements foresee cooperation on cyber-security, terrorism, satellite communications, and maritime security, which are also key elements of the Lisbon Treaty.
Likewise, the joint expeditionary forces established under the treaties could lead to the eventual creation of a wider structure, as they already contemplate “bilateral cooperation with NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, or other operations.”
Solidarity and agreement on political objectives are the pressing concerns of our age.
The new pact between France and the UK could be a historic step toward rationalizing defense spending rather than toward demilitarizing Europe.
It all depends on the path chosen.
In times of financial crisis, EU member states are unlikely to increase defense spending.
But if France and the UK understand how much their projection of power is linked to that of Europe, if they make cooperation reciprocal and expand it to other European countries – according to the formula foreseen in the treaties – we could eventually see an EU with the ability to assume the defense role expected of it by the global community.
By forcing greater efficiency and collaboration, misfortune can yield benefit.
This path can also ease US concerns about lower European defense spending.
The Franco-British treaties do not address commitments to NATO, a key US interest, because any reduction in the number of European troops deployed abroad inevitably implies a greater economic burden for the US.
The Franco-British agreement does, however, imply progress toward joint European military action, both in Europe and on the international scene, which will encourage the US.
So will the fact that the initiative comes from Europe’s two major military powers (whose combined defense spending represents half of the Continent’s total), both of which have permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
All of this is part of the transatlantic community’s continuing transformation from a set of organizations designed to defend territory against a known aggressor to something more flexible and dynamic.
Establishing joint management and overhauling conventional defense capacities will be a two-pronged challenge: functional, owing to the traditional schema of defense organizations, and political, inasmuch as a cession of state sovereignty will be required.
Another, equally important challenge is cooperation between NATO and Russia, which agreed at NATO’s Lisbon summit in November to collaborate on the Alliance’s anti-missile defenses.
This relationship must be based on cooperation that benefits both sides, and that respects certain common principals of governance and non-interference.
But coordinating and sharing capacities can help both partners deal with the new nature of conflicts.
Here, the EU can exercise leadership, for this is a political process that has only just begun.
As British Prime Minister David Cameron said of the agreement with France: “This is the beginning of something new, not an end in itself” – words that echo those of Jean Monet, one of the Union’s founding fathers, on cooperation in the West. “This is not an end in itself,” Monet said.
The Franco-British agreement in 2010 was one hopeful sign for 2011 and beyond: a step along the arduous but necessary path toward greater European security.

The Case for Kurdistan
TEL AVIV – The Kurds – who occupy a mountainous region that includes portions of Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey – are the largest ethnic group in the world without a state to call their own.
It is time to change that.
The Kurds have been making bids for statehood – and having them brutally suppressed – since the early twentieth century.
But there is a strong case for the United States, in particular, to work toward securing a homeland for the Kurds – a case buttressed by Kurdish militias’ indispensable contribution to defeating the Islamic State.
To be sure, the establishment of a “greater Kurdistan” that includes all areas where the Kurds comprise a majority remains impossible.
If internal Kurdish politics were not enough to prevent such an outcome, geostrategic constraints certainly would be.
Kurdish independence is particularly implausible in Turkey.
The Kurds’ main representative in that country, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – which champions a distinctly secular, Marxist brand of nationalism – has been fighting the Turkish government for decades.
But, the government, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has not wavered in its commitment to preventing the establishment of a Kurdish state, to the point that even the PKK’s founder, Abdullah Öcalan, now favors a resolution that falls short of independence.
Erdoğan’s commitment to ending the PKK’s quest is so strong that he is also working to prevent Syria’s Kurds from leveraging sovereignty from their military gains against ISIS.
He fears that Kurdish success in Syria would inspire Turkey’s Kurds to revive their own fight for statehood in the country’s southeast.
This fear of nationalist spillover has driven Erdoğan’s campaign to create a buffer zone along the Turkish border that extends well into the territory now controlled by Syrian Kurds.
But the Kurdish community in Iraq, represented by the Kurdish Regional Government, has a real shot at statehood.
The KRG is a quasi-sovereign entity overseeing an efficient military and an independent economy.
Although it is plagued by corruption and cronyism, like every other political organization in the region, the KRG represents the only truly functional government in Iraq, presiding over the country’s most peaceful and stable areas.
The strength of the KRG’s position is not lost on its leaders.
The ruling Kurdish Democratic Party plans to hold a referendum on independence this September.
Yet even a resounding call for secession will not be enough to achieve success.
For that, the US must throw its weight behind the pro-Western KRG and offer resolute support for the independence effort.
After 14 years of failed military intervention in Iraq, the US should recognize that “a unified, stable, democratic, and federal Iraq,” as a State Department spokesperson recently put it, is a chimera.
Since the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraq’s political system has become highly polarized along sectarian lines, with the ruling Shia majority marginalizing the Sunnis, including the Kurds.
Indeed, Sunni exclusion was a key reason for the rise of ISIS.
Today, Iraq is effectively an Iranian trusteeship, not a US ally.
To the dismay of the Kurds and other Sunni Iraqis, Shia militias controlled by the Iraqi and Iranian governments, such as Hashd al-Shaabi, are filling much of the void left behind by ISIS.
As the experience in Yugoslavia showed, when ethnic or religious cleavages explode, the most effective path to peace may well be separation.
And a Kurdish state has a real chance of thriving: an independent Kurdistan could manage to combine natural-resource wealth with a tradition of stable and pragmatic governance, thereby creating a sustainable democracy.
This would amount to a win for pro-Western forces in the Middle East.
Even Turkey may be willing to accept such an outcome.
The US and Turkish governments agree on distinguishing the Kurds in Iraq from those in Turkey, for whom statehood is not an option.
In fact, Turkey has strong relations with the KRG – bilateral trade has lately been expanding, and KRG oil pipelines extend into Turkish territory – because Erdoğan’s government views it as a counterweight to Turkey’s PKK.
Moreover, now that President Donald Trump, by ending US military support for Syria’s anti-government rebels, has effectively handed the country over to Russia and Iran, Sunni-led Turkey needs a strategic buffer against Shia-led Iraq and Syria more than ever.
As it stands, the Trump administration – not to mention Iraq’s national government, led by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi – claims that the Kurdish referendum, let alone secession, would destabilize Iraq.
Some argue that it might even drive voters to choose a more radical Shia government in next year’s elections – one that would be far less accommodating toward the Kurds.
But, with US backing, such an outcome could be avoided.
In fact, it is in America’s own interest to build a true Sunni alliance that includes an independent Kurdistan.
The Palestinians, who have also spent far too long on the losing side of the Middle East’s strategic game, could enrich such an alliance further.
The Trump administration is eager to contain the influence of the Russia-Iran-Hezbollah axis in the Middle East.
But it cannot achieve this objective by simply offering more arms to Saudi Arabia or its Sunni proxies.
Respecting the yearning of disenfranchised and oppressed peoples – beginning with the Kurds – for freedom, democracy, and competent governance remains vital for a durable Western imprint on the region’s future.

Should You Buy a Home in the US?
NEW HAVEN – A few days ago, I got an email from a man who chastised me for my skepticism about investing in housing today.
He identified himself as a former US Air Force pilot during the Vietnam War who subsequently became a stockbroker and banker before retiring recently.
“You, as an educated person,” he wrote, “should be helping and promoting the ownership of real estate.”
He was responding to my warning about a bubble in home prices in many places around the world.
According to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, US home prices rose at a record rate of 19.7% in the last year, and now look very unstable.
They might increase further for a while, but that may be followed by serious declines.
Still, my correspondent was at least partly right about what I should say to the public about homeownership.
In particular, we should recognize its big-picture effect on our lives, despite the recent extreme price volatility.
But investing in housing in booming locations may not be as safe a long-term bet as many seem to think.
Prospective US home buyers might logically assume that their tenure in a house will outlast any interruption to an upward trend in home prices, enabling them eventually to benefit from new highs.
After all, real home prices in the United States fell by 36% nationally from December 2005 to February 2012, because of the Great Recession, but then increased by 71% to a level 10% above their 2005 peak.
However, I have been arguing for years that the US housing market’s performance since 2005 is not the only relevant example of long-term home-price trends.
My historical data show that real US national home prices were sometimes lower in the 1990s than in the 1890s.
Over that century, cities spread out to cheaper land, and building tools, technology, and transportation became more efficient.
Moreover, land itself is still cheap: the average cost today of one acre (0.4 hectares) of US farmland – onto which one can easily squeeze four or five houses – is only $3,380.
Yes, farmland may be far away from cities, but history shows that cities start sprouting up in new places as the population increases.
Nevertheless, the Air Force pilot turned banker disagreed with my real-estate outlook.
“In this country, like all developed countries, real estate is at the root of wealth as measured by money value,” he wrote. “It has been that way for at least a thousand years, and there is no indication we are creating any more real estate.”
So, let’s imagine that, for the past 1,000 years, home prices had beaten the US stock market’s average 7% annual return (after reinvesting dividends) in the twentieth century. During that time, these home prices, after compounding, would have increased by a factor of 24 followed by 28 zeroes.
But hardly any homes from a millennium ago remain today, and hardly anyone would want to live in those that have survived.
Furthermore, the land they sat on is often no longer valuable.
In Biblical times, for example, Ephesus in western Turkey was a coastal city with magnificent buildings.
But its once-valuable harbor has since silted, so that the city’s ruins are now miles from the sea.
It is mostly true that we are not creating any more real estate, if we consider land only in the strict sense of the term.
Land creation, as in the case of Dubai’s artificial archipelagos, is not a scalable solution.
But we are essentially adding new space by developing high-rise apartments, creating virtual land in the form of online conference services and electronic storage, and improving transportation so that people can live in remote areas with cheap land.
The emailer then recounted his own experiences in the US housing market:
“The first house we bought was in 1971 for $19,000, now worth over $300K, second house for $34K, now worth over $400K, third house for $130K, now worth over $450K, fourth house for $190K, now worth $435K, fifth house for $305K, sold for $800K three years later, the current house bought for $300K (downsizing in retirement) and worth $450K.”
According to his numbers, the value of the first house has increased by a factor of 15.8 (300,000/19,000).
But over that 50-year period, the US consumer price index has risen by a factor of 6.7, which means that the real value of the home did little more than double.
And the compounded annual real price return over those five decades is only 1.7%.
Finally, he noted, “even the tax laws favor owning real estate.”
That is true.
There is often a tax subsidy to homeownership; in most countries, imputed rent on owner-occupied housing is not subject to income tax.
But this tax subsidy does not appear to be growing, and so does not justify continued increases in home prices.
But I take the emailer’s moral imperative seriously.
Even at currently elevated US home-price levels, buying still makes sense for those who are set on homeownership and want to get on with their lives.
Homeownership can activate a predilection for community, long-term friendships with neighbors, and a sense of security and permanence.
Moreover, buying a house with a mortgage serves as a self-control mechanism that helps people to save more.
The discipline imposed on young homeowners by regular amortizing mortgage payments is a key driver of retirement saving. And buyers can hedge some of their risk in the home price index futures market.
Make no mistake: homeownership clearly has its benefits.
But people who really want to buy now need to be sure that they can accept what could be a rather bumpy and disappointing long-term path for home values.

The Paradox of Blinking
SINGAPORE – The world has recently witnessed two major diplomatic blinks.
Japan, facing mounting pressure from China, unconditionally released a Chinese trawler captain whose ship had rammed a Japanese naval patrol boat. And US President Barack Obama did nothing when Israel refused to extend its freeze on new building construction in the West Bank, causing Israeli West Bank settlers to rejoice.
In the short run, it is clear who lost. In the long run, however, the outcome of backing down may not be so clear.
China, in particular, should weigh carefully the long-term political price of celebrating its supposed victory over Japan.
According to Newton’s third law of motion, “for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.” Geopolitics has a similar law: whenever the world sees a new emerging power, the world’s greatest existing power tries, directly or indirectly, to block its rise.
Today, the world’s greatest power is the US, and the greatest emerging power is China.
So far, surprisingly, the US has not forged a strategy to thwart China’s rise.
The reasons for this geopolitical aberration are complex. But a key factor is that, until recently, China’s leaders have abided by the wise counsel of Deng Xiaoping: taoguang yanghui (conceal [our] capabilities and avoid the limelight), and shanyu shouzhuo (be good at keeping a low profile).
China’s decision to browbeat the Japanese into submission over the fishing trawler, suggests that China may be throwing Deng’s geopolitical caution out the window.
More recklessly, after securing the release of the trawler, China demanded an apology from Japan.
A major rule in international relations is never to make a demand that cannot be met.
Having already been humiliated by China, such an apology would be politically suicidal for the Japanese government.
In fact, China should hope that no such apology is forthcoming.
In the past few decades, Japan has become a sleeping tiger.
Having outperformed the rest of Asia for more than a century, the Japanese have decided to slow down.
Japan has lost its drive to remain one of the world’s greatest powers, and it may never regain it.
But, given Japan’s history, one would be foolish to underestimate the country.
While the world frets about North Korean and Iranian nuclear weapons, it is useful to remind ourselves that Japan, should it choose, could become a nuclear power in a matter of weeks.
It has all the ingredients, though painful memories of World War II and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have so far kept its leaders well away from developing a nuclear stockpile.
Moreover, if Japan needs allies to balance the rise of China, it could easily turn not only to the US, but also to Russia and India.
In short, the geopolitical cards could turn out in Japan’s favor if China overplays its hand.
Similarly, geopolitics does not work in Israel’s favor on the West Bank issue.
When US global dominance was unquestioned, as in the 1990’s, it made sense for Israel to secure its long-term future by maintaining a stranglehold over the US Congress.
But American power has peaked.
At its high water mark, the US, with 5% of the world’s population, accounted for close to 30% of global GDP.
Given this spectacular economic performance, Americans could spend more on defense than the rest of the world combined.
All this, quite naturally, led to geopolitical hubris, in Washington and in Tel Aviv.
While US power will inevitably decline in relative terms, that of the 1.3 billion people who live in the Islamic world – the vast majority of them in Asia – will inevitably increase.
The rising economic tide that is lifting China and India will lift them as well.
Asian Muslims have the same mentality as the Chinese and Indians. What China and India are doing today, Asia’s Muslim societies will do tomorrow.
As a result, the combined GDP of the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference nations – now only about 13% of global output – will easily double in the coming decades.
So time is no longer on Israel’s side.
The security fostered by America’s unchallenged global power has been shown to be an illusion.
Soon America will have to make major geopolitical adjustments, especially if its economy underperforms in the coming decade or two. Like the former Soviet Union, the US will have to carry out perestroika and cut defense spending.
As a friend of Israel, I am surprised that more of us are not calling on the country’s leaders to seize the brief geopolitical opportunity of a viable two-state solution, while the offer remains on the table.
Israel’s continued humiliation of the Palestinians, now telecast live into hundreds of millions of Muslim homes, is generating unnecessary reservoirs of hate.
The scenes of exultant West Bank settlers only aggravate this.
Israel’s recent falling out with its best friend in the Islamic world, Turkey, should have provided its leaders a premonition of the new world that is coming.
The fallout with Turkey was a minor tremor.
With larger geopolitical earthquakes coming, the time for Israel to act is now.

Why Russia’s Economy Will Not Collapse
GENEVA – The rapid depreciation of the ruble, despite a dramatic – and seemingly desperate – late-night interest-rate hike by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) last month, has raised the specter of Russia’s economic meltdown in 1998.
Indeed, the West has sought to animate that specter in its ongoing confrontation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
But, though Russia’s economy is undoubtedly in trouble, a full-blown collapse is unlikely.
Oil and gas account for more than 60% of Russia’s exports; other primary commodities make up much of the rest.
Given this, the recent sharp decline in world oil prices obviously represents a major shock – large enough, when combined with the effect of increasingly strict Western sanctions – to provoke a sizeable recession.
To make matters worse, commodity prices are expected to remain low for some time.
In that case, the income loss would become much more than a temporary setback.
But Russia is no economic basket-case-in-waiting – at least not yet.
The situation today is very different from that in 1998, when Russia was running twin fiscal and current-account deficits.
Russia needed to borrow, and it was borrowing heavily in foreign currency.
This meant that as the ruble depreciated, Russia’s debts rose.
Eventually, default became inevitable.
By contrast, in recent years, Russia has enjoyed a sizeable budget surplus, and public debt is below 20% of GDP.
It is true that income from oil and gas, which represents the bulk of government revenues, has been halved when measured in dollars.
But the Russian currency has fallen by about the same percentage, meaning that the government’s income in rubles remains approximately unchanged.
Similarly, Russia’s current-account balance has been mostly in surplus in recent years.
Gross public and private external debt is below 40% of GDP, and much of it is denominated in rubles.
The sharp fall in export income is rapidly changing the situation, but Russia is starting from a comfortable position.
To panic would be premature.
The ruble’s free fall has been driven mainly by capital outflows.
Russia’s famous oligarchs have already stashed most of their wealth abroad, but they retain significant savings at home.
As the economic and political situation deteriorates, they are most likely pulling more money out.
Small savers have every reason to switch into foreign currency as well.
This has put the CBR in a challenging position.
The ruble’s depreciation is bound to fuel inflation, already around 11% and far above the CBR’s 5% target.
In that context, raising the interest rate sharply makes sense, and officials may be hoping that the hike will stem capital outflows – despite the risk that the decision, if interpreted as being aimed at defending the currency, could have the opposite effect.
The trouble is that the higher interest rates are bound to deepen Russia’s economic downturn, making the CBR an easy scapegoat.
Never mind that the central bank is not responsible for Russia’s troubles – the run on the ruble, the recession, and the flare-up of inflation – and that using interest rates to prevent capital outflows always fails.
Embattled politicians can be counted on to point the finger.
The threat to Putin is clear.
He risks the fate of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, who presided during a period of unusually low oil prices.
Until now, Putin has been lucky, coming to power just as oil prices started to rise.
Most Russian citizens credit him with two decades of rising living standards, following decades of decline.
Putin’s decision not to implement the unpopular reforms that would have created a strong non-oil export sector may have been bad for the economy’s long-term health, but it has allowed him to maintain widespread public support.
His economic good fortune, combined with his readiness to stand up to the West, has created a misguided impression in Russia that the country is, once again, a world power.
Many in the United States and Europe believe that ratcheting up economic pressure on Russia will help drive Putin out.
This is an enormously dangerous gamble.
As Russian living standards decline, Putin’s only viable strategy to remain in power will be an aggressive international posture.
Foreign military adventures, after all, are most appealing when the domestic front is on fire.
None of this means that the West should bow and forsake its principles.
But it does mean that the time has come for a diplomatic approach that does not depend on the prospect of Russia’s economic collapse.

The Silent Pandemic of Antibiotic Resistance
WASHINGTON, DC/UPPSALA – When the World Health Organization launched last year’s World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, it expanded the campaign’s focus from antibiotics to all antimicrobials – including antiviral, antifungal, and antiprotozoal drugs.
The WHO said that framing the response to antibiotic resistance (ABR) within the broader antimicrobial resistance (AMR) agenda, including HIV and malaria, would “facilitate programmatic synergy and efficiency, and catalyze country-level action to combat drug-resistant infections.”
But although there are many commonalities between ABR and AMR, there are also important differences that justify paying specific attention to antibiotics.
ABR has been a slow-growing pandemic, fueled in part by relatively weak political support for implementing national action plans that include the establishment of well-resourced surveillance systems.
The resulting lack of context-specific data on the health and economic burden of resistance has created an obstacle to policy action.
Although aggregate numbers on the global AMR burden exist – the most cited, from the United Kingdom’s independent 2014-16 AMR review, chaired by the economist Jim O’Neill, put the toll at 700,000 deaths per year – these underrepresent the ABR problem, owing to the limited scope of bacteria covered.
In fact, estimates suggest that ABR alone claims more than 750,000 lives every year, with the largest toll most likely occurring among children in the poorest countries.
In a recent global survey, 79% of physicians treating newborns reported an increasing trend of multi-drug-resistant infections over the last five years, while 54% cited ABR as the leading cause of failure to treat neonatal sepsis, a blood infection affecting newborns.
In the past, the drug-resistance problem has typically been addressed by researching and developing new antibiotics.
But although R&D is an important element of the ABR response, it is scientifically challenging and expensive.
In effect, an arms race between drug development and resistance has ensued.
With few novel antibiotics in the development pipeline, we need incentives to spur R&D while decoupling investment returns from sales volumes in order to slow the evolution of resistance.
At the same time, new drugs coming to market must be accessible and affordable for all those who need them.
The additional median overall cost of resistance imposed by moving to second-line treatments can be significant, amounting to $700 per infection.
In fragile states where out-of-pocket payments by individuals account for 55% of total health expenditure, this can have catastrophic consequences, including increased morbidity and mortality, and long-term impoverishment.
The health and economic costs of ABR must be quantified to convince governments to intervene and strengthen incentives for the development of antibiotics.
That, in turn, will justify the investments and public-private partnerships needed to bring new drugs to market.
The fact that ABR seems to be winning the arms race makes it even more important to preserve existing antibiotics.
But there is no one-size-fits-all way to do this.
In many countries, for example, increased access to drugs is imperative to reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections.
Initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria have partly addressed the issue of access to effective antiretroviral, anti-TB, and antimalarial drugs.
But as a WHO report puts it, “there is no similar funding or distribution mechanism to cater for the corresponding needs for effective antibiotics against the broad range of common bacterial infections in developing countries.”
In this context, the newly established Multi-Partner Trust Fund is an important step in the right direction.
Although the fund’s financial scope is still modest, it will support countries in implementing national action plans against the threat of AMR, including ABR.
Balancing the need to preserve antibiotics’ effectiveness while expanding access to them is challenging, because wider use inevitably will increase ABR.
The problem is compounded in many poorer countries, where civil conflicts, poor hygiene and nutrition, and unreliable water supplies risk facilitating the rapid spread of resistant pathogens.
But the full extent of the problem remains hidden, owing to the lack of national surveillance systems for monitoring antibiotic drug use and resistance.
A health-systems approach is critical to ensure that unintended consequences of controlling ABR do not hamper equitable and sustainable access to life-saving drugs.
Africa has recently made important progress in this regard.
Last September, African Union heads of state and government endorsed a common position on controlling AMR.
In addition, Africa is leading the way in collaborative efforts on COVID-19, including the roll-out of cutting-edge technologies such as digital surveillance and next-generation sequencing.
These could become an essential component of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’s AMR Surveillance Network, which aims to connect actors from the human and animal health sectors.
Such efforts are particularly important in the African context, where many low-income and fragile countries are expected to bear the brunt of AMR’s negative consequences.
The growing ABR problem does not respect national borders.
It is essentially the result of multiple systemic failures, which only urgent global collective action can overcome.

No More Pandemic Have-Nots
NEW YORK – COVID-19 has bifurcated the world like almost nothing else.
The wealthiest countries have more than enough vaccine doses with which to protect their people from the ravages of the virus, while the poorest countries do not.
Those in the Global North also have the means to stave off economic calamity and social disruption through massive stimulus packages, while hundreds of millions in the Global South have been driven into extreme poverty.
This inequitable divide leaves humanity far more vulnerable to the next stage of the pandemic, as well as to any other systemic crisis that may emerge.
As leaders of some of the world’s largest philanthropies, there are two things we know for sure.
First, history has taught us that transformational change almost always has been triggered by some deep crisis.
Second, only by coming together can the world muster the bold, urgent action needed to reverse the great divergence between the haves and have-nots that we see today.
Only through cooperation and coordination can we launch a transformative era of progress.
To that end, the Aliko Dangote Foundation, Archewell Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Chaudhary Foundation in Nepal, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, the Ford Foundation, Fundación Saldarriaga Concha, the Kagiso Trust, the MasterCard Foundation, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, the Open Society Foundations, the OppGen Philanthropies, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation have joined forces to establish a global alliance of foundations.
And we are inviting other philanthropies to join our network.
At our first meeting this week, we agreed that our organizations, which have so far collectively pledged $3 billion to fight COVID-19, will mobilize additional resources, expertise, and advocacy power to bolster global efforts.
Our strategies will be shaped by the advice of institutions like the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as civil-society groups and community leaders around the world.
Over the past year, our respective institutions have supported the communities and individuals on the front lines of the crisis, showing in their response the best of what humanity has to offer: commitment, solidarity, courage, and compassion.
Now, the leaders of wealthier countries and global institutions must do the same.
To encourage the necessary global action, our coalition will advocate for two primary objectives.
First, the world must assume collective responsibility to achieve the WHO’s ambitious targets to vaccinate at least 40% of the population in low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year, and 70% by September 2022.
We call on government leaders and policymakers – including those attending this week’s World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, DC, and the G20 summit in Rome later this month – to provide the doses, financial resources, and delivery logistics needed to achieve these targets.
Governments that have stockpiled hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses must immediately redistribute them to low-vaccination countries before they expire in the coming months.
And looking beyond this immediate emergency, we must make critical investments to build long-term pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities in poorer countries, so that we will be prepared for the next global public-health crisis.
Second, to spur global economic recovery, we urge the governments of high-income countries to reallocate at least $100 billion in recycled special drawing rights (SDRs, the IMF’s reserve asset) for low- and middle-income countries in 2021.
We also call on them to commit to a $100 billion replenishment of the World Bank’s International Development Association fund to support the pandemic response and economic recovery in the world’s poorest countries.
We believe that foundations, working within the new coalition and on their own, can play a key role in backing and reinforcing national and global efforts.
Together, we will support those voices who will hold leaders’ feet to the fire until they have delivered on public health and the economic recoveries.
There is no time to waste.
Every month’s delay brings more unnecessary risk and injustice by nurturing new, potentially deadlier variants of the coronavirus, by exposing more people to infection and death, by widening existing inequalities and driving more people into poverty, and by fomenting social and political unrest.
And we must confront all of this at a moment when we also face the existential threat of climate change.
The longer we drag our feet, the more opportunities we will lose.
Inaction translates into more businesses that cannot launch, more hours of school disruptions for students eager to learn, and more months of unemployment for people who are ready to get back to work.
The pandemic is far from the only issue that humanity faces, so our respective foundations will continue to work in many places and on many other issues after the immediate health and economic crises have passed.
But we know that without action today, these interrelated crises will compound humanity’s longer-term challenges.
And we know that, together, we can meet this decisive moment and help to ensure a more equitable, sustainable future for all.

COVID-19 Trumps Nationalism
NEW YORK – I was recently walking along East 29th Street in Manhattan, after visiting a friend at Bellevue Hospital, when I was roused from my thoughts by a middle-aged white male screaming at an old Chinese man, “Get the fuck out of my country, you piece of Chinese shit!”
The old man was stunned.
So was I, before I bellowed back (deploying the full range of my native Australian vocabulary), “Fuck off and leave him alone, you white racist piece of shit!”
The pedestrian traffic stopped.
A young white guy with dark hair came storming toward me.
As a non-pugilist by instinct and training, I braced for what was coming.
He stopped just short of me and said, “Thank you for standing up for him.
That’s why I fought in Iraq; so that people like him could be free.”
Leaving aside the troubled history of the Iraq War, COVID-19 is a stark reminder that global pandemics, like climate change, do not respect political borders.
China’s experience with the virus in January and February is likely to be repeated in much of the rest of the world in March and April.
There will be variations on the numbers of infections, depending on imponderable factors such as the temperature, the relative robustness of public-health testing and treatment systems, and differing levels of financial and economic resilience.
We should be preparing intelligently for these contingencies, not succumbing to irrational panic – let alone pandering to racist stereotypes.
This virus reminds us afresh that no person or country is an island unto itself.
Yet political leaders have often failed to rein in the thinly veiled racism inherent in some of the popular response to the outbreak so far.
In buses, trains, and on streets around the world, Asians, particularly Chinese, have been subjected to the kind of abuse I witnessed.
Now that the virus has struck Italy, are Italians next?
It has been stunning to witness the general absence of solidarity, empathy, and compassion for the Chinese people, particularly those in Wuhan, who have stoically endured a living hell.
How would (or will) Manhattan, London, Sydney, Toronto, Berlin, Paris, or Delhi fare under the same circumstances?
Indifference to the suffering of others gets us absolutely nowhere in marshalling an effective global response to what is demonstrably a global crisis.
The United States could easily have reached out to the Chinese leadership to establish a top-level joint coronavirus taskforce early on, underpinned with a very public expression of human solidarity above politics.
Instead, the administration has issued statements attacking China’s authoritarian political system, and urging American investors and supply chain managers to take refuge in the US.
Yes, over the last three years the US and China have been on a strategic collision course, and normal political hostilities will be resumed once the immediate crisis is over.
But right now, belligerence is not a policy.
It’s just an attitude, and it doesn’t help fix the problem.
On a more positive note, institutional and professional collaboration is underway beneath the surface.
Whatever failings the World Health Organization may have, it is the formal instrument of global governance on pandemics.
Those who have attacked WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus over his organization’s effectiveness should look long at the international statutes that determine its powers.
The WHO is limited to providing international advisory notices on the movement of the virus, clinical and technical advice to national governments on how to deal with it, and emergency triage in places where no health infrastructure exists.
That last duty may become necessary if the virus reaches the poorest parts of the world, as with the 2013-16 Ebola crisis in West Africa.
The WHO is also constrained by collapsing funding levels.
In its attack on “globalism,” the political right sees defunding United Nations humanitarian institutions as a badge of honor, a potent symbol of smashing the “lefties.”
But when essential institutions are defunded, their effectiveness is undermined.
Just ask the World Food Programme, UNICEF, and the UN Refugee Agency, all of which are scrambling to make ends meet.
In the WHO’s case, it’s become reliant on contributions from philanthropies like the Gates Foundation and voluntary pledges.
Meanwhile, in the midst of the current crisis, the Trump administration has proposed slashing the US government’s core contribution to the WHO from $123 million now to just $58 million next year.
In addition to the WHO, we must be thankful for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its network of sister institutions around the world (including in China).
Health professionals in these organizations have been collaborating to analyze the virus, anticipate possible mutations, and develop a vaccine – all despite the toxic political environment.
We also should be thankful for the international (including American) medical, pharmaceutical, and other companies that have been quietly sourcing masks, gloves, gowns, ventilators and other critical supplies for China.
Despite these efforts, at present there is a palpable crisis of confidence around the world, in part because of a loss of confidence in national and global leadership.
This is reflected in public panic and financial markets’ heightened volatility.
Why doesn’t the US convene an emergency G20 meeting of health and finance ministers and heads of government?
Such a gathering wouldn’t have to be held in person; it could be conducted virtually, in partnership with the UN and the WHO.
This could rapidly produce an agreed policy framework – and serious financial commitments – for responding to the unfolding pandemic.
Representing 20 of the world’s largest economies (and many of the countries with more than 100 COVID-19 cases), the G20 is also best positioned to devise a financial and economic strategy for preventing global recession.
Global confidence will recover only when both the public and markets see that governments collectively have stepped into the breach.
That is what happened in April 2009, when the London G20 summit arrested the panic from the 2008 financial crisis, established a basis for coordination, and created a policy and fiscal framework for eventual recovery.
Without multilateral efforts, individual countries will simply continue to forge their own paths, thereby prolonging the recovery.
In times of international crisis, playing the nationalist card is the easiest and crudest form of domestic politics.
But in the cold light of day, it doesn’t fix a single problem.
Only effective global coordination can do that.

Breaking the Climate Deadlock
LONDON – On July 9, the leaders of the world’s largest economies will meet in L’Aquila, Italy, at the Major Economies Forum (MEF) to discuss progress towards a new global climate agreement.
In six months, a deal is supposed to be struck in Copenhagen, so the MEF meeting comes at a vital moment.
When many of the same leaders met in April to address the economic crisis, they rightly pledged to do “whatever is necessary.” The same spirit needs to animate the L’Aquila meeting.
There is enormous good will to do so.
The new US administration is supporting strong American action.
China is setting ambitious targets for reducing energy intensity and making massive investments in renewable energy.
India has put forward its own action plan.
Europe has set a goal of cutting emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 if there is an ambitious global agreement.
Japan has published its proposals for major carbon reductions.
Across the world, commitments are forthcoming.
But practical challenges remain.
What is being asked is that global emissions be less than half their 1990 levels by 2050, having peaked before 2020.
Since emissions from the developing countries are on the whole lower than those of the developed world – and will need to continue to rise in the short-term as they maintain economic growth and address poverty – it has been proposed that developed countries cut emissions by at least 80% relative to 1990 by 2050, with major steps towards this goal over the next decade.
Developing countries will also need to play their part, significantly slowing and peaking emissions growth in the coming decades.
For the US, such commitments would mean cutting emissions to around one-tenth of today’s per capita level, while for China it would mean creating a new low-carbon model of economic development.
For all countries, this is a major challenge – a revolution that implies a huge shift in policy.
The good news is that if we focus on clear, practical, and achievable goals, major reductions can be made in order to ensure that, whatever the precise interim target, the world will fashion a radical new approach within a manageable timeframe.
A new report from the “Breaking the Climate Deadlock” project, a strategic partnership between my office and The Climate Group, shows how major reductions even by 2020 are achievable if we focus action on certain key technologies, deploy policies that have been proven to work, and invest now in developing those future technologies that will take time to mature.
Perhaps the most interesting fact to emerge is that fully 70% of the reductions needed by 2020 can be achieved by investing in three areas: increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and use of lower-carbon energy sources, including nuclear and renewables.
Implementing just seven proven policies – renewable energy standards (e.g., feed-in tariffs or renewable portfolio standards); industry efficiency measures; building codes; vehicle efficiency standards; fuel carbon content standards; appliance standards, and policies for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) – can deliver these reductions.
All seven policies have already been successfully implemented in countries around the world, but they need scaling up.
While cap-and-trade systems or other means of pricing carbon emissions can help provide incentives for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions, in the short term at least, these seven policy measures – and direct action and investment by governments – are needed to achieve the targets.
In the longer term, we also need technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), expanded nuclear power, and new generations of solar energy, together with the development of technologies whose potential or even existence is still unknown.
The important thing for Copenhagen is that decisions are taken now for investments that will yield benefits later.
For example, the overwhelming majority of new power stations in China and India – necessary to drive the industrialization that will lift hundreds of millions out of poverty – will be coal-fired.
That is just a fact.
So developing CCS or an alternative that allows coal to become clean energy is essential for meeting the 2050 goal.
But we need to invest now, seriously and through global collaboration, so that by 2020 we are in a position to scale up CCS or be ready to deploy other alternatives.
Renaissance of nuclear power will require a big expansion of qualified scientists and engineers.
Electric vehicles will need large adjustments to infrastructure.
Smart grid systems can enable big savings in emissions, but require a plan for putting them into effect.
These measures will take time, but require investment now.
Meanwhile, in the short term, low energy lighting and efficient industrial motors may sound obvious, but we are nowhere near using them as extensively as we could.
So we know what we need to do, and we have tools available to achieve our goals.
MEF leaders can therefore have confidence in adopting the interim and long-term targets recommended by the scientific community: keeping warming to below two degrees Celsius; peaking emissions within the next decade; and at least halving global emissions by 2050 versus 1990.
Developed countries will be able to commit to reducing their emissions by 80% versus 1990 by mid-century, as many have already done, and provide the necessary financial and technology support for developing countries’ adaptation and mitigation efforts.
With that support, developing countries in turn will need to design and implement “Low-Carbon Growth Plans” that significantly slow and eventually peak their emissions growth.
By making these commitments, the MEF leaders, whose countries account for more than three-quarters of global emissions, would lay a firm foundation for success in Copenhagen.
Between L’Aquila and Copenhagen, there will undoubtedly be difficult discussions over interim targets for developed countries.
While such targets are important, what matters most is agreement on the measures that ultimately will set the world on a new path to a low carbon future.
For years, the emphasis has rightly been on persuading people that there must be sufficient “will” to tackle climate change.
But leaders, struggling to cope with this challenge even amidst economic crisis, need to know that there is also “a way.”
Only by combining the two will we succeed.
Fortunately, such a way – immensely challenging but nonetheless feasible – exists.

White House Sex Crimes
NEW YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature, even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States.
How extraordinary, then, to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes, Condoleezza Rice, has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison.
Even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of “a few bad apples” low in the military hierarchy, I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top.
It’s not that I am a genius. It’s simply that, having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime, I have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recognizable ways.
We now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Rice – who actually chaired the torture meetings.
The Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives.
And documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld, in his own words, “checking in” on the sexualized humiliation of prisoners.
The sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex-crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US-held prisoners.
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture, it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this.
The nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation, electrodes attached to genitals, and forced sleep deprivation, to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced.
These abuses violate both US and international law.
Three former military attorneys, recognizing this blunt truth, refused to participate in the “military tribunals” – rather, “show trials” – aimed at condemning men whose confessions were elicited through torture.
Though we can now debate what the penalty for water-boarding should be, America as a nation, maintaining an odd silence, still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved.
Why?
It’s not as if the sex crimes that US leaders either authorized or tolerated are not staring Americans in the face: the images of male prisoners with their heads hooded with women’s underwear; the documented reports of female US soldiers deployed to smear menstrual blood on the faces of male prisoners, and of military interrogators or contractors forcing prisoners to simulate sex with each other, to penetrate themselves with objects, or to submit to being penetrated by objects.
Indeed, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse.
There is also the testimony by female soldiers such as Lynndie England about compelling male prisoners to masturbate, as well as an FBI memo objecting to a policy of “highly aggressive interrogation techniques.”
The memo cites a female interrogator rubbing lotion on a shackled detainee and whispering in his ear – during Ramadan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive – then suddenly bending back his thumbs until he grimaced in pain, and violently grabbing his genitals.
Sexual abuse in US-operated prisons got worse and worse over time, ultimately including, according to doctors who examined detainees, anal sodomy.
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person, but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders.
Those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim, they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior.
Abusers start by undressing their victims, but once that line has been breached, you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and anal penetration, greater and greater pain and fear being inflicted, and more and more carelessness about exposing the crimes as the perpetrator’s inhibitions fall away.
The perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever-escalating rationalizations, often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good.
Finally, the victim is blamed for the abuse: in the case of the detainees, if they would only “behave,” and confess, they wouldn’t bring all this on themselves.
Silence, and even collusion, is also typical of sex crimes within a family.
Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence.
Just as sex criminals – and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy – were tried and sentenced after the wars in Bosnia and Sierra Leone, so Americans must hold accountable those who committed, or authorized, sex crimes in US-operated prisons.
Throughout the world, this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power.
These acts need to be called by their true names – war crimes and sex crimes – and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims.
As in a family, only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assault can the healing begin.

The Dred Scott of Climate Change?
WASHINGTON, DC – In 2015, 21 young people between the ages of 11 and 22 filed a major lawsuit against the US government for failing to limit the effects of climate change.
In Juliana v. United States, the plaintiffs argue that because they will have to live with the repercussions of global warming for much longer than anyone else, on average, the government’s failure to protect the environment violates their constitutional rights to equal protection under the law and due process.
The philosopher Peter Singer points out that this case represents a historical turning point, because it addresses the rights of children and future Americans to a livable environment.
But the trial is about more than the environment; it will have far-reaching implications for intergenerational justice more broadly.
Consider the issue of public debt.
There have always been moral objections to one generation burdening the next with excessive debt, effectively limiting young people’s future liberty by impinging on their ability to form families, educate children, and create wealth.
With US federal deficits rising toward $1 trillion a year, the issue is becoming cripplingly urgent.
In deciding Juliana v. United States, the Supreme Court must grapple with the fact that the US Constitution does not explicitly recognize future citizens.
While it was the first of many national constitutions to embody the Enlightenment principles that citizens are equal under the law and endowed with unalienable rights, it applies those principles only to living Americans.
Future US citizens will have rights only after they are born.
That might sound reasonable.
But if the interests of future Americans are not protected, powerful actors today can drain resources from the not-yet-born.
The result is environmental degradation, unsustainable public debt, and generations of under-educated, unemployable people who will have difficulty raising their own children to become productive adults.
One modern country does recognize this risk in its constitution: Germany.
Article 20a of Germany’s Grundgesetz (Basic Law) stipulates that, “Mindful also of its responsibility toward future generations, the state shall protect the natural foundations of life and animals by legislation and, in accordance with law and justice, by executive and judicial action…”
By demonstrating that younger living citizens suffer more than their older counterparts from short-sighted fiscal and environmental policies, Juliana could be the first step toward recognizing a similar responsibility in the US.
It is a small step, but one that could have far-reaching implications for policy, especially at a time when the president and his administration are actively pursuing policies that effectively loot the next generation.
And, indeed, US President Donald Trump’s administration has resisted the case at every turn.
Earlier this year, a lower court ruled that the case could go to trial, and the trial was set to begin at the US District Court in Oregon, on October 29.
But in late September, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary stay of the case to consider a request from the Justice Department to halt it altogether – a highly unusual move.
Fortunately, the Supreme Court decided to deny the government’s request and let the trial move forward.
But the Trump administration is not giving up: it has now filed dismissal appeals with the US District Court in Oregon and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
Trump administration attorneys insist that the case is “nonjusticiable,” meaning that the courts are not the proper venue to resolve the issues in Juliana; even if this was not the case, they continue, the plaintiffs lack standing to sue.
The US federal courts from the district level up to the Supreme Court – all of which have already ruled that the case should go to trial – clearly disagree.
There are parallels between Juliana v. United States and the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford.
Scott, a slave, sued for his and his family’s freedom in 1857 – eight years before the US Constitution’s 13th Amendment abolished slavery.
Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled that slaves and their descendants were “beings of an inferior order” who had “no rights which the white man was bound to respect.”
Scott, therefore, had no standing to sue in federal court.
Will Kelsey Juliana, the chief plaintiff in the federal suit, also be denied?
Already, in the US Supreme Court’s comments about Juliana, there are echoes of Dred Scott.
Ultimately, however, the Dred Scott ruling was out of touch not only with basic morality, but also with the growing economic and cultural power of the North and the direction of US history.
That is what we are seeing today, both in the Trump administration’s claims that Juliana is nonjusticiable, and in US law’s antiquated failure to recognize future Americans’ rights to a livable environment, unburdened by excessive debt.
Opponents of Juliana, including the politically influential energy industry, cynically hope that they can succeed in getting the case dismissed and put generational rights in the hands of a deeply divided – and, for powerful vested interests, pliable – Congress.
Like the opponents of emancipation in the 1850s, they count success in terms of the few months or years they can continue to benefit from the Constitution’s lacunae.
And they may well be able to hold onto the past a little longer.
When it came to abolishing slavery, the US trailed the United Kingdom by more than 30 years – a delay that only made matters worse in the mid-1800s.
But the direction of history is clear.
The tide is turning against permitting living citizens to exploit their children and grandchildren.
In this sense, whatever the outcome, Juliana v. United States is just the beginning.

The Climate Crisis Is Also a Health Crisis
GENEVA – The latest Lancet Countdown report, which monitors the health consequences of climate change, highlights the need to prepare for future calamities.
Even as COVID-19 continues to spread, a recent study suggests that the likelihood of another pandemic increases by 2% each year.
In the coming decades, the interplay between the climate crisis and public health could create a perfect storm of global devastation and disruption.
The good news is that if we take immediate steps to transform our health systems, we can avert another COVID-style catastrophe.
As with the current pandemic, the obstacles to mitigating climate change are not just scientific or technological, but also rooted in geopolitics and market forces.
Self-interest can undermine public health, particularly when it comes to equitable access to resources.
Even so, the international community came together to introduce innovative mechanisms like the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access facility (COVAX), which was designed to remove the financial barriers that prevented lower-income countries from obtaining vaccines.
We must launch similar mechanisms for addressing the global public-health impact of climate change.
While we already know many of the likely solutions, their effectiveness requires that we put them in place before disaster strikes.
This is not just a moral imperative; it is also a smart economic choice that would likely reduce the overall cost of outbreaks and other climate-related catastrophes.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt this past November underscored the fact that sustainability is not just about decarbonization, electric vehicles, or climate-adaptation measures such as flood defenses.
It is also about pandemic preparedness.
More broadly, climate change is expected to shift the habitat range of deadly pathogens, causing infectious, mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever to spread as far as northern Europe and Canada.
At the same time, the climate crisis threatens to increase the prevalence of malaria, cholera, and schistosomiasis across the developing world.
The world’s poorest countries remain the most vulnerable to climate change, despite contributing the least to creating the problem.
That is why the international community must take immediate steps to ensure that impoverished, marginalized communities have access to vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics.
Given the devastating impact that a single virus has had on billions of lives, livelihoods, and the global economy over the past three years, it is abundantly clear that we must urgently take steps to counter climate-related health threats.
The global effort to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines provides a useful model.
The Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment, a financial mechanism funded by donors and accelerated by the European Investment Bank, enabled people in the world’s 92 poorest countries to obtain free vaccines.
These lower-income countries, representing roughly half of the world’s population, would have struggled to secure access otherwise.
So far, more than 1.6 billion COVAX doses have been delivered to developing countries, helping to ensure that 52% of their citizens are fully vaccinated, compared to a global average of 64%.
This is a remarkable achievement, particularly in the context of intense vaccine hoarding by developed countries, the export restrictions that some countries placed on vaccines and the components needed to produce them, and the actions of some manufacturers that have seemingly prioritized profit over fairness.
The COVAX model’s success shows that there is scope for similar innovative financing solutions to climate-related health risks.
For example, several private-sector actors are currently exploring a Climate Advance Market Commitment to stimulate innovation and investment in climate solutions.
Similarly, there is great potential for mechanisms based on the model of the International Finance Facility for Immunization, which uses dedicated “vaccine bonds” to frontload long-term donor commitments so that funds can be made available immediately.
Multilateralism is essential to establishing these safety-net mechanisms.
COVAX was possible only because it united the financial firepower and knowhow of more than 190 governments, along with private-sector partners, civil-society groups, and international agencies, around a common cause that benefited everyone.
But if COVAX had already existed before the pandemic, equipped with at-risk contingency financing and surge capacity, it could have mounted its response – the world’s largest and most complex global deployment of vaccines ever – even faster, ultimately saving more lives.
Following COP27, donor governments and multilateral lenders must examine how existing financial mechanisms could be adapted to the fight against climate change to guarantee that funds are made available as soon as a threat emerges.
Minimizing the overall financial costs of climate-related health risks involves not just prevention but also early action.
These safety-net mechanisms should also be designed to protect the world’s most vulnerable people, wherever they live.
But what matters most is that these steps are taken now.
As The Lancet report warns, the countdown to the next global health crisis has already begun.

The Crowding-Out Myth
LONDON – Three economic effects of COVID-19 seem to be generally agreed upon.
First, the developed world is on the brink of a severe recession.
Second, there will be no automatic V-shaped recovery.
And third, governments will therefore need to “support” national economies for an indefinite period.
But, despite this consensus, little thought has been given to what private firms’ prolonged dependence on government support will mean for the relationship between the state and the capitalist economy.
The main obstacle to such thinking is the deeply entrenched notion that the state should not interfere with long-term capital allocation.
Orthodox economic theory holds that public investment is bound to be less efficient than private capital.
Applying an oversimplified logic then leads to the conclusion that practically all investment decisions should be left to the private sector.
The two generally recognized exceptions are “public” goods such as street lighting, which private firms have no incentive to supply, and “essential” goods like defense that must be kept under national control.
In all other cases, the argument goes, the state should allow private enterprise to select investment projects in line with individual consumer preferences.
If the state were to substitute its own choices for such rational market-based allocations, it would “crowd out” higher-value activities, “pick losers,” and impede growth.
But the crowding-out argument is wrong both theoretically and empirically.
First, it assumes that all resources in an economy are fully employed.
In fact, most market economies normally have underemployment or spare capacity, meaning that public investment can “crowd in” resources that otherwise would be idle.
This was John Maynard Keynes’s key argument, and it cannot be stressed often enough.
And the superior efficiency of a boom-and-bust private investment system dominated by financial oligarchs is far from obvious.
Second, the state has in practice always played a leading role in allocating capital, either through direct investments of its own (including most nineteenth-century railway-building), or by deliberately encouraging certain types of private investment.
For example, Toyota, which started out as a textile-machinery manufacturer, became a leading global automobile producer from the early 1960s onward with the help of tariff protection and state subsidies.
Nor did Silicon Valley succeed because the state got out of the way of risk-taking venture capitalists and garage investors.
From the Internet to nanotechnology, most of the major technological advances of the last half-century were financed by government agencies.
Private firms entered the game only once the returns were within clear sight.
And then there’s China, whose economic ascent is the apotheosis of state-led development today.
Governments also have frequently intervened to rescue large, tottering private firms from the consequences of their own follies or unexpected shocks, with the 2008 bailout of the banking system being the most recent example.
But these operations have rarely led to constructive institution-building; rather, governments have sought to return the rescued firms to private ownership as soon as they became profitable again.
Of course, we can never prove that a country will invest better if the state has a hand in the process.
Moreover, many countries have lacked the state capacity needed to make public investment work.
But one historical example of state investment in industrial firms – that of the Italian holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) – sheds light on the conditions under which it might succeed.
IRI’s establishment in 1933 was the unintentional consequence of the bailout of Italy’s three largest banks, which were on the verge of collapse following the Great Depression.
It quickly became obvious that the banks’ balance sheets could not be restored without restoring profitability to the hundred or so firms in which the banks owned equity stakes, but for which no unguaranteed private capital was available.
Through IRI, the state became the owner of the country’s biggest industrial complex, eventually owning 21.5% of Italian joint-stock company shares.
The three “lives” of IRI highlight the benefits and potential pitfalls of public investment.
During the remainder of the 1930s, the companies in IRI’s portfolio recovered under the direction of the anti-fascist businessman and statistician Alberto Beneduce, whom Benito Mussolini had the good sense to appoint as the holding company’s first president.
Under the fascist system, pork-barrel politics were not allowed to interfere with IRI’s investment decisions.
IRI enjoyed a second successful period immediately after World War II, when the technocratic tradition inherited from the 1930s kept political influence at bay.
As Laurie Macfarlane and Simone Gasperin of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose tell it, IRI spearheaded Italy’s post-war reconstruction and economic miracle.
In this period, IRI companies accounted for about 50% of Italy’s steel output, and supplied high-quality, low-price steel to the vital machine-goods sector (where IRI accounted for more than one-quarter of total production).
Similarly, the holding company’s shipping firms boosted the shipyards that it owned.
IRI also built Italy’s motorways and telephone networks in the 1960s, and developed the national airline Alitalia.
Moreover, IRI became the national and often a European leader in aerospace, microelectronics, complex systems engineering, and telecommunication technologies.
“What became known as the ‘IRI formula,’” write Macfarlane and Gasperin, “involved mixed private-public ownership of certain companies.”
But the story did not end happily.
By the 1970s, IRI’s losses grew, owing to its heavy investments in declining sectors, especially steel.
Whatever the causes of its decline, IRI increasingly appeared to conform to the neoliberal model of the inefficient, corrupt state corporation.
Its assets were gradually sold to pay its mounting debts, and the company was finally wound up in 2002.
IRI’s mixed record raises the crucial question of how such statist institutions can succeed.
The answer, surely, is to give them a broad mandate that reflects an accepted national purpose, while insulating their commercial decisions from political meddling.
This is easier said than done.
But we should give the matter constructive thought, rather than surrender to neoclassical first principles.
A market-driven economic system that lacks political accountability and periodically crashes is simply too dangerous.

The End of Chinese Central Planning
BEIJING – “Isn’t it now time for China to abandon the concept of a growth target?”
That was the question I asked Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei this week at the 15th annual China Development Forum, which brings together top Chinese officials and an international delegation of academics, leaders of multilateral organizations, and business executives.
Having attended the CDF since former Premier Zhu Rongji initiated it in 2000, I can attest to its role as one of China’s most important platforms for debate.
Zhu welcomed the exchange of views at the Forum as a true intellectual test for China’s reformers.
It was in that spirit that I posed my question to Lou, whom I have known since the late 1990’s.
In that period, he has been Deputy Minister of Finance, founding Chairman of China’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, and now Minister of Finance.
I have always found him to be direct, intellectually curious, a first-rate analytical thinker, and a forward-looking advocate of market-based reforms.
He is cut from the same cloth as his mentor, Zhu.
My question was set in the context of the new thrust of Chinese reforms announced at last November’s Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which emphasized the “decisive role” of market forces in shaping the next phase of China’s economic development.
I prefaced my question by underscoring the inherent contradiction between a target and a forecast in framing China’s major economic objectives.
I argued that the former embodied the obsolete straitjacket of central planning, while the latter was far more consistent with market-based outcomes.
A target perpetuates the image of the all-powerful state-directed Chinese growth machine – a government that will essentially stop at nothing to hit a predetermined number.
While it may seem like splitting hairs, continuing to frame the economic goal as a target sends a message of determined and explicit guidance that now seems at odds with the government’s market-oriented intentions.
Wouldn’t dropping the concept send a far more powerful message?
Isn’t it time for China to let go of the last vestiges of its centrally planned past?
Lou’s response: “Good question.”
China, he went on, is in fact moving away from its once single-minded emphasis on growth targeting.
The government now stresses three macroeconomic goals – job creation, price stability, and GDP growth.
And, as evidenced by the annual “work report” that the premier recently submitted to China’s National People’s Congress, the current emphasis is in that order, with GDP growth at the bottom of the list.
This gives China and its policymakers considerable room for maneuver in coping with the current growth slowdown.
Unlike most Western observers, who are fixated on the slightest deviation from the official growth target, Chinese officials are actually far more open-minded.
They care less about GDP growth per se and more about the labor content of the gains in output.
This is particularly relevant in light of the important threshold that has now been reached by the structural transformation of the Chinese economy – the long-awaited shift to a services-led growth dynamic.
Services, which now account for the largest share of the economy, require close to 30% more jobs per unit of output than the manufacturing and construction sectors combined.
In an increasingly services-led, labor-intensive economy, China’s economic managers can afford to be more relaxed about a GDP slowdown.
Last year was a case in point.
At the start of 2013, the government announced that it was targeting ten million new urban jobs.
In fact, the economy added 13.1 million workers – even though GDP expanded by “only” 7.7%.
In other words, if China can hit its employment goal with 7.5% GDP growth, there is no reason for its policymakers to panic and roll out the heavy counter-cyclical artillery.
That, in fact, was pretty much the message conveyed by a broad cross-section of senior officials at this year’s CDF: Slowdown, yes; major policy response, no.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of the People’s Bank of China, was just as emphatic on this point.
The PBOC, he argued, does not pursue a single target.
Instead, it frames monetary policy in accordance with what he called a “multi-objective function” comprised of goals for price stability, employment, GDP growth, and the external balance-of-payments – the latter factor added to recognize the PBOC’s authority over currency policy.
The trick, Zhou stressed, is to assign weights to each of the four goals in the multi-objective policy function.
He conceded that the weighting problem has now been seriously complicated by the new need to pay greater attention to financial stability.
All of this paints China with a very different brush than was used during the first 30 years of its growth miracle.
Since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms of the early 1980’s, less and less attention has been paid to the numerical targets of central planning.
The State Planning Commission evolved into the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) – though it is still housed in the same building on Yuetan Street in Beijing.
And, over time, economic managers succeeded in drastically curtailing sector-by-sector Soviet-style planning.
But there was still a plan and an aggregate growth target – and an all-powerful NDRC hanging on to the levers of control.
Those days are now over.
A new “leading committee” on reforms is marginalizing the NDRC, and China’s most senior fiscal and monetary policymakers – Lou Jiwei and Zhou Xiaochuan – are close to taking the final step in the long journey to a market-based economy.
Their shared interpretation of flexible growth targeting puts them basically in the same camp as policymakers in most of the developed world.
The plan is now a goal-setting exercise.
From now on, fluctuations in the Chinese economy, and the policy responses that those fluctuations imply, need to be considered in that vein.

Achieving a “Europe of Results”
BRUSSELS – The tsunami that has swept across financial markets is a global catastrophe.
If handled correctly, however, the crisis may yet raise the esteem of the European Union and its institutions.
The EU’s legitimacy problem has two different aspects: apathy, leading to a low turnout in the European parliamentary elections, and outright euro-skepticism.
The voter-turnout problem partly reflects frustration about the present state of the EU, and also people’s impression that they can exert little influence by voting one way or the other.
Euro-skepticism, on the other hand, and the looming threat of anti-European populism, is directly linked to the idea that the EU is not merely incapable of offering a solution to the crisis, but in fact is part of the problem.
So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today’s increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization.
Many people confuse these two aspects of the EU’s legitimacy problem, and believe that somehow turnout in European elections can be increased by pointing out to people how good and important the EU is.
But in most cases, this is not possible.
At first sight, the easiest answer to the problem of low voter turnout is to give more power to the European Parliament.
But if this was the solution, then we would not have had steadily declining turnouts since the high point of 63%, at the first elections to the European Parliament in 1979. After all, since then the EP’s influence and powers of joint decision-making have grown constantly.
The trouble is that, EP elections must be “about” something if voters are to be interested, which means they must involve a real choice.
And a real choice requires Europe-wide election campaigns by all parties. This would also involve making the choice of the European Commission’s president dependent on the outcome of the EP elections.
But, in fact, both of these conditions have already been met; in 2004, Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso was appointed President of the Commission because he came from the political organization with the strongest election result, the European People’s Party.
And this year’s elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at European level than ever before.
Instead, I believe that the most important way to reawaken voters’ interest in European elections will be to open up the election of the Commission’s President to them, and create a genuinely Europe-wide political debate during the next election campaign.
The Euro-skepticism problem can be tackled only if the Union itself starts to perform better, and is seen to be doing so.
That is why in the aftermath of the failed referenda four years ago in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional treaty, the Commission tried to emphasize the idea of a “Europe of Results” that would seek to convince citizens of its worth through concrete achievements.
Given the gravity of the economic crisis, the time has come for the EU to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible.
The aim must be not only to win back the hearts of Europeans who have become skeptical, but also to convince them that the Union is indispensable to meeting the challenges Europeans face.
Europe’s citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own.
In Ireland, last autumn’s financial crisis provoked a turnaround in public opinion about the EU, and even in Iceland, although it lies on the periphery of our continent, membership of the EU and the euro have become a priority.
European countries have become so interconnected that isolated national measures on issues like financial-market regulation are hopeless.
A changing world in which new powers like China and India play an increasingly important role will not wait for Europe to make up its mind.
The EU must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world’s current problems.
As for the European People’s Party, for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people.
The economic crisis was caused by shortsightedness and a lack of control in the global financial system. Now we must redefine the role of regulators in financial markets and in the wider economy, for we cannot let the financial sector walk off with the profits and leave taxpayers bearing the losses.
That doesn’t mean that we are advocating a move to socialism; we want better and smarter regulation, not regulation for its own sake.
We see five keys to recovery:
A “Europe of Results” is achievable.
It can strengthen the EU’s legitimacy, though, only if policy recommendations such as these, and the successes that result from implementing them, are communicated clearly and effectively to the general public.

Closing the Political Gender Gap
WASHINGTON, DC – A record number of American women are running for elected office in 2018, many of them motivated by outrage over US President Donald Trump’s policies and attitudes.
But running is not winning, and outrage alone cannot produce the kind of steady progress needed to achieve political equality.
To produce a substantial increase in the number of women in Congress, changes that run deeper than the current electoral “pink wave” will be needed.
With only 19.3% female representation in the House of Representatives and 23% in the Senate, the United States currently ranks 103rd in the world in terms of women’s representation in national legislatures.
To improve its record, the US should look to countries with greater gender parity.
At the top of that list is Rwanda, where women make up 61.3% of the lower house and 38.5% of the upper house.
In 2003, the country adopted a new constitution that reserves 30% of parliamentary seats for women and requires political parties to ensure that women hold at least 30% of elected internal positions.
France is one of 49 other countries that also have statutory quotas or reserved seats for women.
Such quotas may, however, be unnecessary.
In seven of the top ten countries for female representation, political parties have voluntarily implemented their own rules on the matter.
Globally, over 100 political parties in 53 countries have voluntary measures in place to increase the number of women candidates and party officials.
But, legislated or not, quotas can be controversial.
Some claim that they are undemocratic.
There is no doubt that they are a blunt instrument.
Can we do better?
A more nuanced approach would focus on eliminating the underlying, interconnected barriers that women face in getting nominated for elected office and conducting successful campaigns.
Such obstacles include the election system itself (women fare better under proportional representation than they do in first-past-the-post systems based on single-member districts); lack of access to financing; weaker professional networks; and outside responsibilities that make it harder to take on punishing and unpredictable working conditions.
Overcoming such structural barriers requires a comprehensive strategy for supporting women candidates.
One of the most powerful tools is money.
In many countries, the cost of campaigning is becoming prohibitively high for most aspirants, regardless of gender.
But women seem to have it worse than men.
In a 2008 survey of 292 parliamentarians around the world, the Inter-Parliamentary Union found that female MPs viewed lack of finance as a more significant deterrent to entering politics than their male counterparts did.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the US, where parties and candidates can spend almost unlimited amounts to get elected.
Wealthy candidates (usually men) finance their own campaigns, with some women, such as Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein, relying on their husbands’ fortunes.
Overall, this system disadvantages women.
Fortunately, some countries are introducing innovative measures to address this problem.
In Georgia, for example, political parties that include at least 30% of each gender on their electoral lists receive a 30% supplement from the state budget.
Similarly, in Ireland, political parties lose 50% of their state funding if their candidate pool includes less than 30% of either gender.
Beyond financing constraints, women face high social and cultural barriers to political participation.
In particular, greater care obligations, reinforced by public perceptions of a “woman’s role,” severely undermine women’s ability to run for public office.
These issues are difficult to address directly.
One step that could help would be for male politicians to assume more care responsibilities, thereby making the playing field more level, while demonstrating that family is a high priority for everyone.
Likewise, new mothers should be able to bring their children to work.
In 2015, a photo of Argentinian MP Victoria Donda Pérez breastfeeding while taking part in a parliamentary hearing went viral, as it demonstrated the commitment, capabilities, and challenges of working mothers.
Such challenges were exemplified by the experience of Madeleine Henfling, a member of Germany’s Thuringia state parliament, who last month was barred from entering the legislative chamber with her six-week-old baby.
Concrete policies should also be put in place to support working parents, by giving them more flexibility to meet family responsibilities.
That is why the United Kingdom’s House of Commons is considering introducing proxy voting, as part of a broader effort to give members – male and female – parental leave.
Women may also benefit from targeted training.
UN Women’s recent Political Academy in Tunisia trained women candidates on local governance, the missions and roles of municipal councils, and media relations.
Some may one day follow in the footsteps of Souad Abderrahim, who was elected the first woman mayor of Tunis with the support of the Islamist Ennahda Movement.
Some leaders have made powerful statements in support of greater female participation in government.
In 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave his country its first cabinet with an equal number of men and women.
His Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez has gone a step further, appointing a cabinet where women outnumber men.
Political parties, which serve as gatekeepers for aspirants to public office, also have significant power to find creative ways to support women candidates.
Nigeria’s two main parties, for example, will waive or reduce non-refundable nomination fees for the 2019 general election.
One Cambodian party provides women candidates with basic campaign resources, including clothing and a bicycle.
In past Canadian elections, political parties have reimbursed women candidates for child-care and travel expenses, and provided subsidies to women seeking nomination in constituencies where a male incumbent is retiring.
The New Democratic Party and Liberal Party have endeavored to have women candidates run for “winnable” open seats.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to gender inequality in politics.
But there is plenty that can – and should – be done to ensure that women’s voices are heard.

Who Needs a Digital Dollar?
BERKELEY – The idea of a digital dollar has been in the air for some time now.
Recently, it descended from the ether to the lips of US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell.
At an event in February, Yellen flagged the idea as “absolutely worth looking at,” adding that the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, in conjunction with academics at MIT, was already doing so.
In Congressional testimony the following day, Powell called a digital dollar “a high priority project for us.”
Some see this as another front in the technological cold war between the United States and China.
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will almost certainly be the first major central bank to roll out a digital currency, in 2022 at the latest.
If the US doesn’t move quickly, it will fall behind.
America’s financial system will remain stuck in the twentieth century, damaging US competitiveness.
The dollar’s position as the dominant international currency will be eroded by the ease of using China’s digital unit in cross-border transactions, and the US will squander a singular source of monetary and financial leverage.
In fact, such concerns are either overblown or flat-out wrong.
The PBOC’s main motivation for issuing a digital renminbi is to create a government-controlled alternative to two very large and loosely regulated digital payment platforms, Alipay and WeChat Pay.
The ubiquity of Alipay and WeChat Pay raises the specter of the Chinese authorities losing control of payment flows through the economy.
And because they use information on payments to inform their lending activities, their pervasiveness points to the possibility of the authorities losing control of financial flows and credit allocation more generally.
Thus, the PBOC’s determination to issue a digital currency is part and parcel of the Chinese government’s decision last November to quash the initial public offering of Ant Group, Alipay’s corporate parent.
The American government has no analogous worries.
In the US, scores of different platforms, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Square carry out digital payments, which are ultimately settled by banks, and hence through Fedwire, the Federal Reserve’s in-house system for clearing interbank transactions.
Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express process the lion’s share of card-based payments, but their actual cards are issued by banks, which are regulated, limiting risks to the payments and financial system.
Here, too, settlement occurs through Fedwire.
Similarly, it is important to bear in mind how far the renminbi lags behind the greenback as an international currency.
Currently, China’s currency accounts for a mere 2% of global cross-border payments, a negligible share compared to the dollar’s 38%.
To be sure, the convenience of a digital renminbi would hasten its uptake in cross-border transactions.
But that digital currency might also have a hidden backdoor, enabling Chinese authorities to track transactions and identify those undertaking them, discouraging use by third parties.
Given this, it’s hard to see China’s digital currency as a game changer internationally.
So, the decision to create a digital dollar would have to be justified on other grounds.
The soundest justification is financial inclusion.
Americans without credit cards and bank accounts, who rely entirely on cash, are denied not just financial services but other services as well.
Rideshare companies ask you to link your app to your credit or debit card; no card, no pick-up.
And no bank account, no card.
In this context, recall the difficulty the US Treasury had in getting pandemic relief checks to the unbanked.
If everyone had a Federal Reserve-issued electronic wallet into which digital dollars could be deposited, this problem would be solved.
Digital dollars could also address the exorbitant cost of cross-border money transfers.
But foreign governments might be reluctant to permit their nationals to install the Fed’s digital wallet, because that would leave them and their central banks unable to enforce their capital controls, which they value as macroprudential tools.
Alternatively, the Fed’s digital wallet could be made interoperable with foreign digital wallets.
But interoperability would require close cooperation between central banks on the details of technology and security.
While there are efforts in this direction, making it work would be a daunting task, to say the least.
Ultimately, such advantages should be weighed against the costs and risks of digitizing the dollar.
If people shift their savings from banks to digital wallets, banks’ ability to lend will be hamstrung.
Some banks will close, and small businesses that rely on banks for credit will have to look elsewhere.
Moreover, a Fed-run network of retail payments would be a rich target for hackers and digital terrorists.
Security and financial stability are of the essence, and it is not obvious that they can be guaranteed.
All this is to say that while the case for a digital dollar may be worthy of examination by Yellen and Powell, it is hardly a slam-dunk.

Iran’s Nuclear Grass Eaters
MADRID – After long years of failed international efforts to end Iran’s cunning drive to develop nuclear weapons, the question today is no longer whether the West can prevent the nuclearization of Iran’s military arsenal, but whether the Islamic regime collapses first.
Unfortunately, if it does not, the only option for stopping Iran is war – and war is a very bad option.
Pakistan is worth invoking when assessing whether the sanctions now imposed on Iran will force it to surrender its nuclear program.
In 1965, Pakistani Foreign Minister Zulficar Ali Bhutto famously declared that if India, its sworn enemy, went nuclear, his country would “eat grass and even go hungry” in order to develop a nuclear bomb of its own.
Today, Pakistan, a near-failed state on the verge of disintegration, possesses more nuclear warheads than India.
Iran’s theocratic regime, immersed in a momentous struggle for survival against what it regards as an unholy alliance of Israel, the American “Great Satan,” and a surrounding Arab world that abhors its hegemonic ambitions, will not surrender its nuclear ambitions easily. Indeed, nuclear weapons appear to be the regime’s only real route to self-preservation.
The French and the Soviet revolutions taught us that exporting the revolution is one way to protect it.
Iran tried that, and failed.
The almost inevitable fall of Iran’s closest ally in the region, the Baath regime in Syria, only adds to the regime’s paranoid anxieties – and makes developing a nuclear capability seem all the more necessary for its survival.
Iran’s leaders might be ready to let their people “eat grass and even go hungry” for the sake of their nuclear ambitions, but Iran’s squeezed middle class, one hopes, will not submit to such degradation.
Social unrest has been building up in Iran for years, and certainly began well before the West became serious about imposing economic and financial sanctions.
In fact, the popular revolts in Tunisia and Egypt were directly inspired by Iran’s Green movement, which emerged during the massive post-election protests in 2009, before succumbing to a brutal government crackdown.
The sanctions against Iran have undoubtedly bitten hard.
But the truth is that the severe economic hardships suffered by ordinary Iranians mainly reflect the regime’s economic mismanagement, and the widespread fear that the threat of war from both Israel and the United States, sometimes abetted by Iran’s own war rhetoric, has unleashed.
Indeed, Iran’s economy is now firmly in the grip of a war panic.
When a national currency loses 50% of its value in a matter of weeks, economic collapse is at hand.
Businessmen find it impossible to use the rial even for domestic transactions, because inflation is spiraling out of control.
Commodity prices, moreover, are skyrocketing, and the cost of small and mid-size apartments has become prohibitive for a middle class severely hit by unemployment.
Iran’s backward economy, a third of which is controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, is simply incapable of offering job opportunities to Iran’s growing cohorts of university graduates – the same segment of society that toppled the Shah.
The problem has become increasingly acute, because 60% of Iran’s population was born after 1979.
Moreover, rapid population growth and bungled economic policy have made Iran excessively dependent on food imports.
Yet, however crippling the effect of sanctions might be, they will not bring the regime to surrender its nuclear program.
The most for which one can hope is that sanctions enhance the chances of regime change by reawakening popular protest, thereby triggering an Iranian version of the Arab Spring.
This might be wishful thinking, however.
And, even if social unrest does erupt, repression might succeed again.
But an attack by either Israel or the US on Iran’s nuclear installations would be a calamitous mistake, or, as Meir Dagan, a former chief of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, put it, “the stupidest idea” possible.
So it is to be hoped that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s war rhetoric and vulgar manipulation of the memory of the Holocaust are nothing more than a ploy to divert the world’s attention from the Palestinian problem that he has done nothing to resolve.
Alas, one cannot rule out a scenario in which nothing – diplomacy, sanctions, or the push for a regime change – works.
In that case, one should not underestimate the pernicious effects of Israel’s Holocaust complex.
What led Israel to war in 1967 was not a sound assessment of Egypt’s intentions to attack, but fear of a second Shoah.
An attack on Iran might, however, produce precisely the effect that Netanyahu seeks to avoid.
Post-war global diplomacy might have to promote, perhaps more robustly than ever, the creation a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East, and thus address Israel’s nuclear capabilities, as well as the Palestinian problem – issues that Netanyahu has worked hard to ignore.
But if the path of war is finally taken, and, in its aftermath, the international community fails once again to pacify the world’s most dysfunctional region, the Middle East would devolve into an unruly chaos far more dangerous than the threat of an Iranian bomb.

Emerging Economies’ Demographic Challenge
WASHINGTON, DC – Population aging is often cited as a major economic challenge for the developed world.
But a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows that shifting demographics pose an even greater threat to the growth prospects of many emerging economies.
Over the last 50 years, the world's 1.6% annual population growth fueled a surging labor force and a rapid increase in GDP in many emerging economies.
Employment more than doubled in China and South Africa, and at least tripled in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Nigeria.
In Saudi Arabia, employment increased almost nine-fold.
But, with population growth slowing, average annual employment growth in emerging economies is expected to drop from 1.9% to 0.4%.
In absolute terms, the decline will exceed that of developed economies, where annual employment growth is expected to fall from 0.9% to 0.1% the coming years.
In most economies, employment is expected to reach its peak within the next half-century; in China, the labor force could shrink by 20% over this period.
Of course, there are exceptions to this trend.
Indonesia and South Africa are projected to continue to experience rising employment (albeit at slower rates).
Nigeria's labor force is expected to triple from 2014 to 2064, and many other economies in Sub-Saharan Africa will experience similar levels of growth.
But, overall, economies' demographic tailwinds will wane, with serious consequences for GDP growth.
With no other change in current trends, emerging economies' rates of GDP growth would fall by one-third, from 4.8% to 3.1% annually, by 2064.
More problematic, the declining share of the working-age population is set to cause per capita GDP to decline by more than 30% in some countries – most notably, Brazil, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.
The good news is that emerging economies have at their disposal a powerful means to offset these trends: productivity growth.
To be sure, annual productivity growth in emerging economies would need to accelerate by 57%, from 2.8% to 4.4%, to compensate fully for the demographic shift.
But, even if that ambitious goal is not achievable everywhere, emerging economies have considerable scope for catch-up productivity growth.
After all, over the last 50 years, the productivity gap between emerging and developed economies has barely narrowed; in absolute terms, it has more than doubled.
Indeed, though average productivity growth in emerging economies has accelerated in every decade since the 1970s, this largely reflects rapid productivity growth in just one country: China, where the annual average has been 5.7% since 1964.
Elsewhere, the record has been patchy.
Mexico and Saudi Arabia improved their productivity by less than 1% per year over this period; Argentina, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa managed productivity growth of 1.2-1.5%.
There is reason to believe that these economies can do much better.
With a comprehensive approach, 11 emerging economies (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey) could, on average, boost their annual productivity growth to as much as 6% by 2025.
Four-fifths of that growth would be achieved through the adoption of approaches that have already been successful elsewhere, with new technological, operational, and business innovations covering the rest.
Opportunities to catch up to developed-country productivity levels abound across key sectors.
In retail, emerging economies could double their productivity by 2025, largely by adopting modern store formats, such as supermarkets and hypermarkets, which are at least three times more productive than traditional small shops.
In Mexico, boosting the share of modern retailers by 10% would yield a 25% increase in the sector's total productivity.
Similarly, if China's huge automotive industry consolidated operations into a smaller number of larger plants operating close to capacity, the sector's productivity – which is well below the developed-country average – could rise by up to 50%.
And many countries can improve the efficiency of food value chains considerably, such as by mechanizing agriculture.
There is also enormous scope for productivity-enhancing innovation, particularly in health care, a sector that is just evolving in most emerging countries.
Digitization of health records enabled India's Bhorugram Rural Dispensary nearly to double the number of immunizations it provided in just four years.
Likewise, it allowed clerks at western Kenya's Mosoriot Rural Health Center to spend two-thirds less time interacting with other staff on administrative tasks, and almost twice as much time registering patients.
In terms of operational innovations, there is the example of India's Aravind Eye Care System, which, by applying principles of industrial engineering to its work flow, has become the world's largest eye-care provider. Aravind can carry out two-thirds the number of operations conducted by the United Kingdom's entire National Health Service at one-sixth the cost – and with a lower infection rate.
Governments can play an important role in promoting such innovation.
Brazil's deregulation of agriculture and encouragement of R&D enabled the Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation to pioneer more than 9,000 technology projects, including the design of a tropical soybean strain that can thrive in Brazil's climate.
Efficiency soared, placing Brazil's crop yields on par with those of developed economies.
The era of “easy" GDP growth driven by a massive army of young workers is ending.
Emerging economies must face the resulting growth challenge head-on, by pursuing sweeping changes in policies, incentives, and established practices to boost productivity.
Recognizing this imperative is the first step. Now the hard work must begin.

China’s New Global Leadership
NEW YORK – The biggest economic news of the year came almost without notice: China has overtaken the United States as the world’s largest economy, according to the scorekeepers at the International Monetary Fund.
And, while China’s geopolitical status is rising rapidly, alongside its economic might, the US continues to squander its global leadership, owing to the unchecked greed of its political and economic elites and the self-made trap of perpetual war in the Middle East.
According to the IMF, China’s GDP will be $17.6 trillion in 2014, outstripping US output of $17.4 trillion.
Of course, because China’s population is more than four times larger, its per capita GDP, at $12,900, is still less than a quarter of the $54,700 recorded in the US, which highlights America’s much higher living standards.
China’s rise is momentous, but it also signifies a return.
After all, China has been the world’s most populous country since it became a unified state more than 2,000 years ago, so it makes sense that it would also be the world’s largest economy.
And, indeed, the evidence suggests that China was larger (in terms of purchasing power parity) than any other economy in the world until around 1889, when the US eclipsed it.
Now, 125 years later, the rankings have reversed again, following decades of rapid economic development in China.
With rising economic power has come growing geopolitical clout.
Chinese leaders are feted around the world.
Many European countries are looking to China as the key to stronger domestic growth.
African leaders view China as their countries’ new indispensable growth partner, particularly in infrastructure and business development.
Similarly, economic strategists and business leaders in Latin America now look to China at least as much as they look to the US.
China and Japan seem to be taking steps toward better relations, after a period of high tensions.
Even Russia has recently “tilted” toward China, establishing stronger connections on many fronts, including energy and transport.
Like the US after World War II, China is putting real money on the table – a lot of it – to build strong economic and infrastructure links with countries around the world.
This will enable other countries to boost their own growth, while cementing China’s global economic and geopolitical leadership.
The number of Chinese initiatives is staggering.
In just the past year, China has launched four major projects that promise to give it a greatly expanded role in global trade and finance.
China joined Russia, Brazil, India, and South Africa in establishing the New Development Bank, to be based in Shanghai.
A new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to be based in Beijing, will help to fund infrastructure projects (roads, power, and rail, among others) throughout the region.
The New Silk Road land belt seeks to connect China with the economies of East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, and Europe through an expanded grid of rail, highways, power, fiber, and other networks.
And the new 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is aimed at boosting ocean-based trade in East Asia and the Indian Ocean.
All told, these various initiatives are likely to leverage hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over the coming decade, speeding growth in the counterpart countries while deepening their production, trade, and financial linkages with China.
There is no guarantee that all of this will succeed or proceed smoothly.
China faces huge internal challenges, including high and rising income inequality, massive air and water pollution, the need to move to a low-carbon economy, and the same risks of financial-market instabilities that bedevil the US and Europe.
And if China becomes too aggressive toward its neighbors – for example, by demanding rights to offshore oil or territory in disputed waters – it will generate a serious diplomatic backlash.
No one should assume smooth sailing for China (or for any other part of the world, for that matter) in the years ahead.
Still, it is striking that just as China is rising economically and geopolitically, the US seems to be doing everything possible to waste its own economic, technological, and geopolitical advantages.
The US political system has been captured by the greed of its wealthy elites, whose narrow goals are to cut corporate and personal tax rates, maximize their vast personal fortunes, and curtail constructive US leadership in global economic development.
They so scorn US foreign assistance that they have thrown open the doors to China’s new global leadership in development financing.
Even worse, as China flexes its geopolitical muscles, the only foreign policy that the US systematically pursues is unceasing and fruitless war in the Middle East.
The US endlessly drains its resources and energy in Syria and Iraq in the same way that it once did in Vietnam.
China, meanwhile, has avoided becoming enmeshed in overseas military debacles, emphasizing win-win economic initiatives instead.
China’s economic rise can contribute to global wellbeing if its leaders emphasize investment in infrastructure, clean energy, public health, and other international priorities.
Still, the world would be better off if the US also continued to lead constructively, alongside China.
The recent announcement by Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping of bilateral agreements on climate change and clean energy show the best of what’s possible.
America’s perpetual war-making in the Middle East shows the worst.

America’s Strategic Blindness
MADRID – The recriminations over US spying activities, triggered by the revelations of the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden, have now reached fever pitch.
Questions abound – about what President Barack Obama knew and when, about the legitimacy of eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders’ conversations, about the future of transatlantic relations, and even about the meaning of the term “ally.”
But the current firestorm, like other recent diplomatic crises for the United States, reflects a more fundamental problem: the lack of strategic vision in American foreign policy.
Until the US is able to establish an overarching, purpose-oriented framework through which it relates to the world, a reactive approach is inevitable, with high-intensity incidents such as we have seen this month continuing to be the norm.
For more than 40 years, the Cold War policy of containment of Soviet influence provided America its strategic framework.
Though US tactics were debated and shifted from administration to administration, the overarching approach remained consistent, because it was broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.
Of course, an overarching national-security strategy provided no guarantee against problems or even major disasters in countries like Vietnam and Nicaragua.
Nonetheless, in hindsight, containment infused an order and organization on US foreign policy that is absent today.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the necessity that had been driving containment disappeared.
The US, inebriated by victory, saw in the triumph over the Soviet bloc another sign of its exceptionalism, and found itself taken in by the mirage that its Cold War success was itself a strategy.
What followed was a decade of scattershot foreign policy marked by notable cases of inaction, together with individual initiatives taken largely without reference to a broader doctrine.
Unchallenged in the world’s unipolar moment, the US had the luxury of not knowing its strategic goals.
Shocked by the attacks of September 11, the US forced a new framework onto its still-unquestioned belief in the inexorable movement of history toward freedom.
Unfortunately, what emerged was a deeply flawed approach, not least because in declaring a “war on terror,” America positioned itself against a tactic, not an entity or an ideology.
Under Obama, the US has begun to depart from this approach.
The problem is that it remains a departure without any meaningful destination.
As in the 1990’s, the US has no organizing imperative, and the result is the same: a combination of inactivity and incoherent initiatives.
And, at a time of domestic political polarization, the lack of a global strategy denies a potential rallying point around which Democrats and Republicans can unite.
Two decades ago, geopolitical conditions limited blowback from America’s foreign-policy vacuum.
Today, the US remains the world’s essential power, but it is no longer the exclusive power.
It cannot solve problems that directly affect it by acting on its own, though its leadership remains indispensable.
That is all the more true given that the nature of such problems has also changed.
America, like the rest of us, is vulnerable to climate change, pandemics, and terrorism – challenges that require coordinated global solutions.
For the US, however, the utility of multilateralism is purely situational.
Above all, multilateralism is never preferable to a “good” bilateral solution – a view that has reinforced behavior that undermines, rather than strengthens, the capacity for effective international action.
Indeed, always ready to negotiate treaties but rarely prepared to sign – and even less likely to ratify – them, the US remains absent from such key global agreements as the Kyoto Protocol, the Mine Ban Treaty, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Its inspired creativity and support in building formal institutions like the United Nations and World Bank has given way to a predilection for weak, informal, and ad hoc groupings, such as the various G-somethings and “coalitions of the willing.”
Establishing effective multilateralism requires an emphasis on rules and institutions that facilitate coordination.
The recent decision by the US to sign the Arms Trade Treaty could be a good start – if only Congress could marshal the bipartisan support needed to ratify it.
But scattered moves in the right direction will not suffice.
What is really needed is a change in vision and mentality – a shift from viewing multilateralism as a tactic to embracing it as a strategic imperative.
The current spying scandal is the product of a rudderless US foreign policy focused on narrowly drawn tactical objectives that exist outside the conceptual funnel of a comprehensive vision.
The result in this case has been damage to the transatlantic relationship, with some in Europe even calling for a halt to the talks on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).
Suspending the trade talks would be folly, not just in terms of the regional impact, but also because the TTIP should be an exercise in rule-making that echoes globally.
The current diplomatic crisis, too, is an opportunity to ensure that transatlantic discussions about privacy and surveillance reverberate in a multilateral setting; seizing it would represent a small but significant contribution to the strategic vision that has been sorely lacking for the last quarter-century.

The Caudillo of the Kremlin
MOSCOW – Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown his regime’s real intentions.
By changing the constitution to allow him to remain in office until 2036 and incorporating conservative new language, it has cast off its teetering mask of democratic legitimacy.
But just as Putin has sought to entrench his rule, his regime is looking weaker than ever.
In the city of Khabarovsk, tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in recent weeks, chanting, “Putin resign!”
They are not alone.
While Putin’s approval rating may seem high, it is low by Russian standards.
In fact, his 59-60% approval rating in recent months is his lowest since October 1999, when he was prime minister.
And it is unlikely to improve significantly for a simple reason: Putin tried-and-tested methods to win support have lost their firepower.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Russia hard, in terms of both public health and economic fallout.
With oil exports, the mainstay of Russia’s economy, down sharply, the government’s budget revenues have cratered.
As a result, the Kremlin’s tacit pact with the public – we ensure your basic wellbeing, and you don’t complain – is unraveling.
Putin’s regime has long sought to divert public attention from domestic problems by touting its foreign-policy victories and its unrelenting battle against a domestic “fifth column.”
Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 embodied what have long been his most effective tactics for securing support: xenophobia, anti-Western hysteria, and the invocation of a glorious past.
His approval rating skyrocketed to more than 85%.
For Putin, however, the impression of broad public support is arguably more important than the support itself.
The July 1 plebiscite on the constitutional amendments meant little in practice.
The changes had been ratified by the Duma (parliament) and regional legislatures months before.
But the popular vote gave the Kremlin the opportunity to claim that nearly 78% of Russia’s citizens supported the changes.
And it could cite the 21% who, according to official figures, voted against the changes to refute the many accusations – including from the European Union – that the vote was rigged.
High voter turnout enhanced the façade.
But the fact that so many people participated under duress – they often had to report to their employers that they had voted – could end up hurting Putin in regional elections this year and in 2021, when federal parliamentary elections will also be held.
Unlike in a plebiscite, people will be able to cast protest votes.
The Kremlin’s heavy use of another favorite tactic – firing, arresting, or otherwise removing ideological opponents – could also backfire.
In early July, the authorities detained two activists – including Andrei Pivovarov, the executive director of exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Open Russia pro-democracy movement – who were campaigning against Putin’s plans to prolong his rule.
Four others had their homes searched.
Several journalists have also been targeted in recent weeks, including Svetlana Prokopyeva (fined for supposedly inciting terrorism) and Ivan Safronov (charged with treason).
Pyotr Verzilov, the publisher of Mediazona, a news site that chronicles abuse in Russia’s justice system, has had his home searched repeatedly.
Likewise, the historian Yuri Dmitriev, whose work exposing Stalin’s crimes has cast doubt on Kremlin hagiography, received a prison sentence for sexual violence against a minor.
And last month, celebrated theater director Kirill Serebrennikov was convicted of embezzlement – part of an effort to crack down on independent theater.
These are proven tactics, but they are also transparent.
And, though a loyal segment of society approves, others – including formerly loyal constituencies – are pushing back.
The Khabarovsk protests were triggered by the sudden arrest of the popular governor, Sergei Furgal, for his alleged involvement in murders dating back to 2004-05, when he worked in business.
Furgal is no liberal; he is a member of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, part of the “systemic opposition” in the Duma.
But he won his position in 2018 by defeating a Kremlin-backed candidate.
By arresting him, the Kremlin likely wanted to send a message to regional leaders who might try to capitalize on the national government’s failures during the COVID-19 crisis.
Instead, the arrest immediately tarnished the image of national unity that the plebiscite result was supposed to project.
To be sure, the Khabarovsk protests alone do not pose a threat to Putin’s rule.
Their effects will be felt nationwide only if they spread to other cities, especially Moscow.
But they should worry the Kremlin nonetheless.
In Khabarovsk, it is not just professionals who are protesting, as has usually been the case.
Мany protesters can hardly be considered politicized intelligentsia from Moscow or Saint Petersburg.
Those in the streets previously would have been part of Putin’s social base.
And they are setting an example for other regions.
Yet Putin’s sclerotic regime has little choice but to continue relying on the same approaches.
The line between those the Kremlin supports (the millions of law-enforcement and security officers, bureaucrats, and other state employees, not to mention loyal oligarchs) and those it doesn’t (virtually everyone else) is growing sharper.
Still, there is no clear political or social force in place that will hasten the regime’s erosion.
If a fatal blow comes, it will be dealt by an unlikely source.
As the Khabarovsk protests have shown, however, unexpected surges of resistance are hardly beyond the realm of possibility.
In any case, Putin’s strategy of preserving power by any means necessary will not solve Russia’s many problems.
And there remains the question of what will happen to the system after him.
What we are witnessing is a further “Francoization” of the Russian political regime: Putin is laying the groundwork to remain head of state for life, as Spain’s Francisco Franco did with the 1947 Law of Succession.
But as Europe grew wealthy in the postwar era, Spain atrophied decade after decade under Franco’s increasingly dozy regime.
Putin seems set on achieving the same level of inertia – in politics, the economy, and society.
But Franco at least had a successor in mind.
By having the monarchy restored on Franco’s death, King Juan Carlos could ascend the throne.
Putin, however, is leading Russia into a dead end.
After all, he cannot bring back the czar.
So he has simply postponed the problem of succession.
Après lui, le déluge.

The Fed's Wary Embrace of Digital Dollars
CAMBRIDGE – Many countries’ governments, most notably China’s, are continuing to experiment with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
Money 3.0 is moving full speed ahead, and with its recent white paper, entitled “The US Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation,” the US Federal Reserve, a conspicuous laggard, has finally started to weigh in, if only tepidly.
The Fed’s caution is understandable, but is it excessive?
The Fed sets an extremely high bar for introducing a retail digital dollar.
For starters, we are told that the new form of money must provide benefits more effectively than other methods, presumably meaning dollar-linked digital stablecoins and existing bank accounts.
For example, one purported benefit of a digital dollar is to provide “real time clearing” for small payments, which of course paper currency already achieves, and the Fed plans to introduce 24-hour electronic payments through banks soon.
The digital currency also must protect privacy (then again, the Chinese authorities say that, too) and must not facilitate criminal activity, which is ironic given the popularity of the $100 bill in the global underground economy.
Most challenging of all is the Fed’s requirement that the expected gains from introducing a digital dollar outweigh any risks it might create.
This is a very tough, but reasonable hurdle.
For all the flaws of the world’s existing financial infrastructure, its inner workings have remained largely intact for decades.
Imagine a nightmare scenario in which a poorly designed digital dollar left open a “back door” that allowed a hostile foreign power to shut down the entire dollar-based global financial system in one fell swoop.
Risks aside, it is not difficult to fathom why the Fed is especially resistant to any quantum change in the existing financial system.
After all, the dollar’s international dominance brings the United States myriad benefits.
It lowers the interest rates that American citizens and corporations have to pay, not to mention those for the world’s biggest borrower, the US government – what Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, then France’s finance minister, famously called America’s “exorbitant privilege.”
Dollar dominance also gives US authorities leverage over the global financial system’s plumbing, including privileged access to information on worldwide dollar transactions.
Moreover, it allows the US to impose significant financial sanctions. Russia has been subject to targeted financial sanctions since its 2014 annexation of Crimea, but President Joe Biden’s administration is now threatening much stronger steps in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
As other central banks lead the charge to introduce digital currencies, some worry that the Fed might find itself in the position of Eastman Kodak (which once made a fortune processing film) when digital photography arrived, or of Swiss mechanical watchmakers when digital timepieces became ubiquitous.
But there is another, more subtle reason for the Fed’s digital-dollar reluctance: The US is still fundamentally a democracy and a market economy.
Although the government has considerable regulatory and legal power to enforce adoption of its digital currency, this applies only up to a point.
The American public cannot be forced to accept a transition it does not want.
Remember when the Treasury tried to popularize $2 bills because it would save money on printing singles?
So, when the US does try to introduce a retail digital dollar – as I believe it eventually will – it may get only one bite at the apple.
At the moment, the range of technologies and options for CBDCs is almost limitless. (The Monetary Authority of Singapore recently held a contest to design the digital Singapore dollar, and the final round – for which I was one of the judges – had no fewer than 15 diverse entries.)
If the Chinese government decides it picked the wrong technology for its CBDC, it can pretty much tell everyone that it wants a do-over.
But if the Fed’s first try at a digital dollar fails, owing to a lack of public interest and political pushback, it might have to wait decades before trying again.
One issue conspicuously absent from the Fed’s white paper is how the Fed plans to regulate the decentralized financial technologies of Web 3.0, a domain where US authorities so far have too often been missing in action.
In particular, US regulators urgently need to do much more to guide and restrain the growth of private cryptocurrencies and their many derivatives.
As US Senator Elizabeth Warren has put it, “crypto is the new shadow bank.”
The common view that cryptocurrencies are basically just used for investment and not for transactions and capital flows – a view to which the Fed paper subscribes – is wishful thinking, as recent research has shown.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has argued that introducing a US CBDC will undercut demand for crypto. That is one of the Fed’s motivations for producing its white paper.
But a lot of the demand for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is from the global underground economy, whether for illegal drug purchases on the dark web, sanctions evasion by Russian oligarchs, capital flight, money laundering, or tax evasion.
There is no getting around the need for strict regulation of advanced economies’ cryptocurrency use now, and of other countries’ CBDCs as they come into international use.
The Fed’s reluctance to rush into launching a digital dollar is understandable, but that is no excuse for the slow pace of regulatory reform.

The Return of Public Investment
CAMBRIDGE – The idea that public investment in infrastructure – roads, dams, power plants, and so forth – is an indispensable driver of economic growth has always held powerful sway over the minds of policymakers in poor countries.
It also lay behind early development assistance programs following World War II, when the World Bank and bilateral donors funneled resources to newly independent countries to finance large-scale projects.
And it motivates the new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which aims to fill the region’s supposed $8 trillion infrastructure gap.
But this kind of public-investment-driven growth model – often derisively called “capital fundamentalism” – has long been out of fashion among development experts.
Since the 1970s, economists have been advising policymakers to de-emphasize the public sector, physical capital, and infrastructure, and to prioritize private markets, human capital (skills and training), and reforms in governance and institutions.
From all appearances, development strategies have been transformed wholesale as a result.
It may be time to reconsider that change.
If one looks at the countries that, despite strengthening global economic headwinds, are still growing very rapidly, one will find public investment is doing a lot of the work.
In Africa, Ethiopia is the most astounding success story of the last decade.
Its economy has grown at an average annual rate exceeding 10% since 2004, which has translated into significant poverty reduction and improved health outcomes.
The country is resource-poor and did not benefit from commodity booms, unlike many of its continental peers. Nor did economic liberalization and structural reforms of the type typically recommended by the World Bank and other donors play much of a role.
Rapid growth was the result, instead, of a massive increase in public investment, from 5% of GDP in the early 1990s to 19% in 2011 – the third highest rate in the world.
The Ethiopian government went on a spending spree, building roads, railways, power plants, and an agricultural extension system that significantly enhanced productivity in rural areas, where most of the poor reside.
Expenditures were financed partly by foreign aid and partly by heterodox policies (such as financial repression) that channeled private saving to the government.
In India, rapid growth is also underpinned by a substantial increase in investment, which now stands at around one-third of GDP.
Much of this increase has come from private sources, reflecting gradual relaxation of the shackles on the business sector since the early 1980s.
But the public sector continues to play an important role.
The government has had to step in as both private investment and total factor productivity growth have faltered in recent years.
These days, it is public infrastructure investment that helps maintain India’s growth momentum.
“I think two sectors holding back the economy are private investments and exports,” says the government’s chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian.
“That is why... public investment is going to fill in the gap.”
Turning to Latin America, Bolivia is one of the rare mineral exporters that has managed to avoid others’ fate in the current commodity-price downturn.
Annual GDP growth is expected to remain above 4% in 2015, in a region where overall output is shrinking (by 0.3%, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest projections).
Much of that has to do with public investment, which President Evo Morales regards as the engine of the Bolivian economy.
From 2005 to 2014, total public investment has more than doubled relative to national income, from 6% to 13%, and the government intends to push the ratio even higher in coming years.
We know that hikes in public investment, just like commodity booms, all too often end in tears.
The economic and social returns decline and money dries up, setting the stage for a debt crisis.
A recent IMF study finds that, after some early positive effects, most public-investment drives falter.
But much depends on local conditions.
Public investment can enhance an economy’s productivity for a substantial period of time, even a decade or more, as it clearly has done in Ethiopia.
It can also catalyze private investment, and there is some evidence that this has happened in India in recent years.
The potential benefits of public investment are not limited to developing countries.
In fact, today it may be the advanced economies of North America and Western Europe that stand to gain the most from ramping up domestic public investment.
In the aftermath of the great recession, there are many ways in which these economies could put additional public spending to good use: to increase demand and employment, restore crumbling infrastructure, and boost research and development, particularly in green technologies.
Such arguments are typically countered in policy debates by objections related to fiscal balance and macroeconomic stability.
But public investment is different from other types of official outlays, such as expenditures on public-sector wages or social transfers. Public investment serves to accumulate assets, rather than consume them.
So long as the return on those assets exceeds the cost of funds, public investment in fact strengthens the government’s balance sheet.
We do not know how the experiments in Ethiopia, India, or Bolivia will eventually turn out; so caution is warranted before one extrapolates from these to other cases.
Nonetheless, all three are examples that other countries, including developed ones, should watch closely as they search for viable growth strategies in an increasingly hostile global economic environment.

The Threat of Greek Debt Relief
BERLIN – With Greece’s economic crisis still raging, prominent voices, ranging from Nobel laureate economists like Paul Krugman to officials like US Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, are calling for more lenient bailout terms and debt relief.
Even the International Monetary Fund – which, along with other European lenders, has provided Greece with emergency financing – recently joined that call.
But could such an approach really be the proverbial silver bullet for Greece’s crisis?
The short answer is no.
While Greece’s public debt is undeniably high, and evidence abounds that high debt can hold back economic growth, the country faces even stronger drags on growth, including structural weaknesses and political brinkmanship, that must be addressed first.
In fact, Greece will likely depend on concessional funding from official sources in the years ahead – funding that is conditional on reforms, not debt ratios.
Greece’s nominal debt stock will matter only once the country re-enters the debt markets and becomes subject to market, not concessional, borrowing terms.
In the meantime, Greece must implement the structural reforms needed to restore the country’s long-term growth prospects and thus to strengthen its capacity to repay its creditors without a large nominal debt reduction.
But there is another critical reason why debt relief is not the answer, and it lies in the political architecture of the European Monetary Union.
Because the eurozone lacks a strong central governing body, crisis policies emerge from a political process in which each of the 19 member states has veto power.
For such a complex system to work, eurozone policymakers must be able to trust one another to behave in a particular way – and that requires a common framework of rules and standards.
A restructuring of Greece’s official debt, despite offering short-term benefits, would weaken that framework in the long run by setting a precedent for exceptions, with other eurozone countries, sooner or later, requesting the same concession.
In 2013, the extension of Greece’s loan maturities prompted Ireland and Portugal to demand – and receive – comparable extensions, despite their less obvious need.
Instead of offering concessions, which could create long-term instability in the eurozone, Europe’s leaders must remain committed to creating strong incentives for all member states to maintain prudent fiscal policies capable of reducing public-debt ratios and restoring fiscal buffers against asymmetric shocks to the currency union.
Only then will the eurozone have a chance of upholding the Lisbon Treaty’s “no bailout” clause.
Greece may account for less than 2% of eurozone GDP, but the pursuit of shortsighted ad hoc solutions to its problems may set precedents that could bring down the entire monetary union.
To prevent such an outcome, it is critical that any solution to the Greek crisis reinforces, rather than undermines, the eurozone’s cohesion.
It is true that Greece has had to undergo painful adjustments to address its deep structural weaknesses, unsustainable public finances, and lack of price competitiveness – adjustments that led to a drop in Greek output.
But high unemployment and a lack of investment cannot be blamed on the medicine prescribed; they are symptoms of the country’s failure to reform its public administration and to enhance the flexibility of its economy.
The international debate about how much austerity is appropriate to balance the interests of Greece and its creditors has distracted policymakers for too long.
It is time to focus on the real imperative: designing and implementing vital structural reforms, at the national and European levels.
To guide this process, the German Council of Economic Experts, which I chair, has developed a set of reforms – called “Maastricht 2.0” – that would reinforce the rules-based framework that is so essential to the eurozone’s long-term success.
For example, the banking union needs to be strengthened through an enhanced resolution regime and an integrated financial supervisor, and a sovereign insolvency mechanism should be introduced.
Underpinning the proposed reforms is the so-called “principle of unity of liability and control,” which demands that both the power to make decisions and liability for their consequences are kept at the same political level, be it national or supranational.
In other words, if countries want to make their own fiscal decisions independent of their eurozone partners, they cannot expect those partners to step in and save them later.
To be sure, in recent years, the European institutional framework has undergone major reforms that reflect the principles of “Maastricht 2.0,” such as the need to emphasize national responsibility for public finances and international competitiveness.
But the reform process remains far from complete.
There is no denying that short-term measures to address acute problems – such as debt relief for Greece – threaten the eurozone’s long-term stability.
If the European Monetary Union is to survive and ultimately thrive, its leaders must not be tempted by facile solutions.

Learning About Growth from Austerity
MILAN – In a recent set of studies, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff used a vast array of historical data to show that the accumulation of high levels of public (and private) debt relative to GDP has an extended negative effect on growth.
The size of the effect incited debate about errors in their calculations. Few, however, doubt the validity of the pattern.
This should not be surprising.
Accumulating excessive debt usually entails moving some part of domestic aggregate demand forward in time, so the exit from that debt must include more savings and diminished demand.
The negative shock adversely impacts the non-tradable sector, which is large (roughly two-thirds of an advanced economy) and wholly dependent on domestic demand.
As a result, growth and employment rates fall during the deleveraging period.
In an open economy, deleveraging does not necessarily impair the tradable sector so thoroughly.
But, even in such an economy, years of debt-fueled domestic demand may produce a loss of competitiveness and structural distortions.
And the crises that often divide the leveraging and deleveraging phases cause additional balance-sheet damage and prolong the healing process.
Thanks in part to research by Reinhart and Rogoff, we know that excessive leverage is unsustainable, and that restoring balance takes time.
As a result, questions and doubts remain about an eventual return to the pre-crisis trend line for GDP, and especially for employment.
What this line of research explicitly does not tell us is that deleveraging will restore growth by itself.
No one believes that fiscal balance is the whole growth model anywhere.
Consider southern Europe. From the standpoint of growth and employment, public and private debt masked an absence of productivity growth, declining competitiveness in the tradable sector, and a range of underlying structural shortcomings – including labor-market rigidities, deficiencies in education and skills training, and underinvestment in infrastructure.
Debt drove growth, creating aggregate demand that would not have existed otherwise.
(The same is true of the United States and Japan, though the details differ.)
Government is not the sole actor in this.
When the deleveraging cycle begins, the private sector starts to adjust structurally – a pattern clearly seen in the data on growth in the tradable side of the US economy.
Muted wage growth increases competitiveness, and underutilized labor and capital are redeployed.
How fast this happens partly depends on the private sector’s flexibility and dynamism.
But it also depends on the ability and willingness of government to provide a bridging function for the deficiency in aggregate demand, and to pursue reforms and investments that boost long-term growth prospects.
If public-sector deleveraging is not a complete growth policy – and it isn’t – why is there so much attention on fiscal austerity and so little action (as opposed to lip service) on growth and employment?
Several possibilities – not mutually exclusive – come to mind.
One is that some policymakers think that fiscal balance really is the main pillar in a growth strategy: Deleverage quickly and get on with it.
The belief that the fiscal multiplier is usually low may have contributed to underestimation of the short-run economic costs of austerity policies – and thus to persistently optimistic forecasts of growth and employment.
Recent research by the International Monetary Fund on the context-specific variability of fiscal multipliers has raised serious questions about the costs and effectiveness of rapid fiscal consolidation.
Estimates of the fiscal multiplier must be based on an assumption or a model that says what would have happened in the absence of government spending of some type.
If the assumption or the model is wrong, so is the estimate.
The counterfactual needs to be made explicit and assessed carefully and in context.
In some countries with high levels of debt and impaired growth, fiscal stimulus could raise the risk premium on sovereign debt and be counterproductive; others have more flexibility.
Countries vary widely in terms of household balance-sheet damage, which clearly affects the propensity to save – and hence the multiplier effect.
Uncertainty is a reality, and judgment is required.
Then there is the time dimension.
If infrastructure investment, for example, generates some growth and employment in the short to medium term and higher sustainable growth in the longer term, should we rule it out because some estimates of the multiplier are less than one?
Similarly, if fiscal stimulus has a muted effect because the recipients of the income are saving to restore damaged household balance sheets, it is not clear we want to discount the accelerated deleveraging benefit, even if it shows up in domestic demand only later.
Policymakers (and perhaps financial markets) may have believed that central banks would provide an adequate bridging function through aggressive unconventional monetary policy designed to hold down short- and long-term interest rates.
Certainly central banks have played a critical role.
But central banks have stated that they do not have the policy instruments to accelerate the pace of economic recovery.
Among the costs and risks of their low-interest-rate policies are a return to the leveraged growth pattern and growing uncertainty about the limits of a central bank’s balance-sheet expansion.
In other words, will the elevated asset values caused by low discount rates suddenly reset downward at some point?
No one knows.
Countries are subject to varying degrees of fiscal constraint, assuming (especially in the case of Europe) a limited appetite for unlimited, unconditional cross-border transfers.
Those that have some flexibility can and should use it to protect the unemployed and the young, accelerate deleveraging, and implement reforms designed to support growth and employment; others’ options – and thus their medium-term growth prospects – are more constrained.
All countries – and policymakers – face difficult choices concerning the timing of austerity, perceived sovereign-credit risk, growth-oriented reforms, and equitable sharing of the costs of restoring growth.
So far, the burden-sharing challenge, along with naive and incomplete growth models, may have contributed to gridlock and inaction.
Experience can be a harsh, though necessary, teacher.
Growth will not be restored easily or quickly.
Perhaps we needed the preoccupation with austerity to teach us the value of a balanced growth agenda.

China Must Restore Growth
BEIJING – China is having an eventful month, marked by proliferating power-supply disruptions and the debt crisis of the country’s second-largest property developer, Evergrande.
What does this mean for China’s post-pandemic economic recovery and growth prospects?
Begin with the energy crisis, which started when a rapid increase in exports – driven by the global recovery – fueled a sharp increase in demand for electricity.
China remains dependent on coal for 56.8% of its total electricity supply.
And yet, in an effort to meet mandatory targets for reducing energy consumption, local governments have shut down many coal mines in recent years.
At the same time, the government’s climate goals – to reach peak carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 – discourage investment in the coal industry.
Of course, these goals also encourage investment in renewables, which are a growing part of China’s energy mix.
But renewables are nowhere near where they need to be to cover the current shortfall.
As a result, when energy demand surged, so did coal prices.
But, because China’s government regulates electricity prices, energy providers – most of which are state-owned enterprises – could not pass the costs onto customers.
To limit the losses, they cut electricity supplies, thereby forcing some manufacturers to curtail production.
Not surprisingly, the government sprang into action. It ordered a rapid expansion of some coal mines, and the reopening of others.
It gave utility companies more leeway in setting electricity prices.
And it pushed manufacturers to boost energy efficiency and accelerate investment in renewable energy.
China will quickly overcome the power shortages, which already are becoming less acute.
But developing a more resilient, sustainable energy sector will take time.
And if each step of the development is not carefully planned and implemented, this transition could weigh on economic growth.
The Evergrande crisis, too, poses serious risks to growth.
Over the years, owing to defective corporate governance, the developer expanded at a frantic pace, not only through its real-estate investments, but also by diversifying into the electric-vehicle industry.
To fund its activities, it borrowed heavily from both commercial banks and capital markets, including issuing dollar bonds to foreign investors.
Ultimately, it racked up some CN¥800 billion ($124 billion) in debt.
Though Evergrande has more than CN¥1.85 trillion in assets, it has not been able to sell them fast enough.
Last month, when the company admitted that it is unlikely to be able to service its debts, rumors of an impending collapse – and a potential Chinese financial crisis – began to swirl.
Yet fears seem largely to be overblown.
To be sure, it would be unwise to predict Evergrande’s fate at this point.
But it is probably safe to assume that the debacle does not pose a systemic threat to China’s financial sector.
Pundits have been predicting since 2012 that a housing-market collapse would trigger a financial crisis in China.
But in Evergrande’s case, the problem is liquidity, not solvency, and any spillover effects can be contained, not least because, despite its issues, China’s banking system is basically healthy.
Real-estate developers and home buyers account for only about 30% of total bank loans, and that share is falling.
The share of new loans that are real estate-related is also on the decline, having dropped from 45% in 2016 to less than 24% in September 2020.
Moreover, in China, there are no subprime loans, and virtually no securitized mortgage loans.
More importantly, there are very few cases of delinquency, let alone mortgage defaults by households: most Chinese commercial banks’ non-performing loan ratio is less than 2%.
Even if there were a major financial event, the Chinese government has enough instruments to deal with it.
So, like China’s energy crisis, the Evergrande debacle does not pose an imminent systemic risk.
But that does not mean policymakers should be complacent.
The real-estate sector is a pillar of the Chinese economy, and an important link in the production chain.
And Evergrande’s collapse would severely disrupt it – not least because a few other large real-estate developers might follow in Evergrande’s footsteps.
Some non-bank financial institutions would also be in trouble.
And, of course, Evergrande’s suppliers would suffer enormously.
All of this would worsen China’s economic prospects.
To prepare for what may come, financial-system vulnerabilities, especially the corporate sector’s high leverage ratio, must be addressed.
But the first priority must be to end the persistent growth slowdown, which began in 2010.
This trend is at least as worrying as the short-term structural problems that have grabbed headlines lately.
China’s experience over the past 40 years shows that without decent growth, financial stability is difficult to achieve.
This pattern is borne out by recently released official statistics indicating that China’s annual growth rate was a lower-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter of this year, and it is widely feared that the growth rate in the fourth quarter may be even lower.
To counter that possibility, Chinese policymakers need to pursue bolder fiscal and monetary expansion, alongside structural reform and adjustment.

Houses in the Air
Over the past six months, attention and worry have shifted from America’s enormous trade deficit to its surging property markets and real-estate bubble.
At least two of the reasons for high – and rising – home prices in the United States are well understood.
What remains highly uncertain, however, is whether an obviously overheating market can be cooled without sending America, and its main trading partners around the world, into an economic tailspin.
The US housing boom is due, first, to low interest rates, which mean that large amounts of money can be borrowed for mortgages with moderate monthly payments.
Low interest rates strengthen the ability to pay, and thus boost demand.
And, with demand high and housing supply fixed – at least in the short run – prices go up.
Second, the 70-year period that began with the widespread diffusion of the automobile –during which one could get nearly anywhere in a typical metropolitan area in half an hour or less – is over.
Before there was widespread automobile ownership, land prices depended on location, and proximity to the central city or to the local railroad station carried a premium.
Now, with serious congestion slowing traffic in major cities to a crawl, the land gradient in housing prices is steep once again.
Perhaps this steepening of the location gradient could be delayed for a decade if we were willing to shift to denser residential patterns.
We could, for example, tear down San Francisco’s row houses and replace them with buildings more like those of New York’s Upper West Side.
But we aren’t willing to do that.
These two factors – low mortgage rates, and the fact that the country has filled up so much that our cars no longer marginalize location costs – go a long way toward explaining the surge in housing prices over the past decade or so.
But they don’t go all the way.
On top of these two powerful fundamental factors sits a bubble.
The bubble is filled by people with money who are buying extra houses because they think home prices will continue to rise, and by people without money who are buying $400,000 houses in less-fashionable neighborhoods with zero percent down and floating interest rates.
When the first group discovers that housing prices don’t always go up, they will try to dump their properties. And when the second group discovers that interest rates don’t always stay low, many of them will be unable to meet their higher mortgage payments and will likewise try to dump their properties.
The end of the American housing bubble might not turn out badly.
But if it does, it will probably be due to a sharp rise in interest rates.
This could happen for two reasons. First, investors, recognizing that the dollar is overvalued and that they are likely to suffer large losses when it returns to its fundamental value, could start selling their Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.
As the prices of these assets fall, their yields will rise.
At some point, the yields on bonds and mortgages will be high enough that investors’ appetite for yield will balance their fear of exchange-rate depreciation.
In the corridors around my office, all the economists agree that this factor should have pushed US interest rates up three years ago.
But so far it has not.
Does this mean that a hurricane could hit world financial markets at any moment?
Yes.
Or it could also mean that economists’ baseline model of the international economy – especially the assumption of “uncovered interest parity,” which holds that foreign interest income expressed in the domestic currency should equal the domestic interest rate – is simply wrong.
The second factor that could push US interest rates sharply upward is not fear of a decline in the future value of the dollar, but the fact of a past decline in its value.
The US imports the equivalent of 16% of its GDP.
A 40% fall in the value of the dollar – of which half passes through to increased dollar prices of imports – thus implies a 3.2% rise in the overall price level.
A Federal Reserve committed to effective price stability will likely raise interest rates rather than allow any year’s inflation rate to jump from 3% to 6%.
If there is a sharp spike in interest rates – caused either by capital flight in anticipation of a dollar decline or by tight monetary policy in reaction to a dollar decline comes to pass – we will see how good the Federal Reserve really is.
If interest rates rise too far, then the collapse in housing values will lead to large-scale foreclosures and a collapse in consumption spending as well.
This would mean a depression not just for the US, but for Asia and probably Europe as well, for the US can remain the world’s importer of last resort and guarantor of effective demand only as long as its domestic consumption is strong.
But if interest rates don’t rise far enough, the value of the dollar will spiral downward and US inflation will spiral upward like in the 1970’s, setting the stage for the type of extremely painful measures imposed by then Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
In these circumstances, straight is the gait and narrow is the path that the Federal Reserve will have to walk – hardly an enviable position.
And yet journalists – not very experienced reporters, to be sure – ask me who is likely to get the “plum job” of Fed Chair next year.

The Tabloid Syndrome
The world is a complex and intricate place.
So how are we to understand even just a piece of it, say, the United States government and its economic policies?
It is a big problem, for the standard sources that I was taught as a child to rely upon – newspapers and television news – are breaking down.
For example, in early February 2004, the then Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, N. Gregory Mankiw, spent some time trying to explain the issues surrounding “outsourcing” to America’s elite political news reporters.
Mankiw’s standard description of outsourcing is very much like mine – indeed, like that of all neoclassical and neoliberal economists – and goes something like this:
As with any change in technology that increases the volume of international trade in goods and services, the outsourcing of service-sector jobs creates winners and losers – but almost surely more and bigger winners than losers.
Big winners are workers in poor countries who get better jobs working for firms that can now export services to rich countries.
The major losers are those who previously held the now-outsourced service-sector jobs; they must now find new and different jobs and almost surely find that their skills are worth less.
But even in the US, losers’ losses are outweighed by winners’ gains.
Workers in certain industries find their skills in higher demand as foreigners spend their increased dollar earnings, consumers benefit from lower prices, and shareholders and managers see their companies’ profits increase.
However much we may worry about the distributional consequences of outsourcing, we should never overlook the fact that it increases the total size of the economic pie.
Mankiw made that argument, but he failed to be understood.
Indeed, on February 10, 2004, he woke up to an unpleasant news story in the Washington Post: ”President Bush’s top economist yesterday said the outsourcing of US service jobs to workers overseas is good for the nation’s economy....
Mankiw’s comments come as the president struggles to shore up support in manufacturing states that have lost millions of jobs....Mankiw’s conclusions may prove discordant during an election year...”
It happened again on February 11: “Democrats...lit into President Bush’s chief economist yesterday for his laudatory statements on the movement of U.S. jobs abroad....
Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.) called for the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw...”
Of course, the Washington Post’s journalists know, on some level, that they were being unfair to Mankiw.
They didn’t claim that what he said was inaccurate, or shortsighted, or analytically unsound.
The descriptive terms they used – “discordant,” “embarrassing,” “political liability” – suggest that they knew they were giving Mankiw a raw deal.
But was there any sign of the standard economic analysis of outsourcing in their stories?
Not one.
Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its “2004 Economic Report of the President.”
But the last thing the reporters wanted to do was to convey a thumbnail summary of Mankiw’s analysis of outsourcing.
That’s simply not the business they saw themselves as being in.
The problem is not that the Washington Post and papers like it hire people who are unintelligent or lazy.
The problem is that conveying accurate information about the economy is far down the list of priorities for normal news reporters.
Making a splash matters. So does keeping track of who is up politically and who is down.
So does pleasing your editors so that they’ll give your stories better placement, and pleasing your sources so that they’ll keep talking to you.
Compared to these imperatives, there is little to be gained from informing the public about how the economy really functions and about the dilemmas of economic policy.
Indeed, the economy is vastly inferior to Hollywood as a source of glitterati gossip, but much economic reporting makes the coverage of the birth of Brad Pitt’s and Angelina Jolie’s baby look profoundly serious.
Likewise, government is vastly inferior to the World Cup as a sporting spectacle, but much political reporting focuses on who played well and who played badly.
What can we do about this?
The answer is simple, and it is a matter of demand, not supply.
After all, few people go into journalism to deliberately mislead the public.
If we demand better economic and political journalism the way we demand excellent coverage of the World Cup, we’ll get it.

Empowering Bangladesh’s Female Garment Workers
DHAKA – For four decades, the garment industry has powered Bangladesh’s economy and put more people to work than any other sector.
Women in particular have benefited from this hiring boom, and today, a majority of the industry’s four million employees are female.
But while the textile trade has put money in women’s purses and challenged a patriarchal society to evolve, economic empowerment has not greatly improved gender equality and female wellbeing.
On the contrary, women with jobs in Bangladesh’s largest industry are now imperiled on two fronts – at home and at work.
While much has been written about exploitation in the garment industry, there is a paucity of data on the health and safety implications for women in this sector.
Our organization, icddr,b (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh), is working to change this.
In a series of recent studies, we explored the health and welfare issues – both physical and emotional – faced by women who produce clothing that they will never be able to afford.
The women we spoke with shared markedly similar stories.
Most were or had been married, are poorly educated, and migrated to cities from poverty-stricken households in Bangladesh to work and support their families.
Most interviewees reported working at least ten hours per day, every day.
Many work overtime to meet their daily production quota of 100 shirts per hour.
And, depending on their position, they spend the entirety of their shifts either standing (if they are quality inspectors), sitting (if they are machine operators), or moving (if they are factory-floor helpers).
But what makes our studies unique is the information we collected about what happens after work.
And here, the data are even more striking.
For starters, most married female workers’ workdays don’t end when their shift at the factory does.
Back at home, they are expected to cook, clean, and perform other household chores – work on top of work that leaves them exhausted and prone to illness.
Pregnant women in particular suffer significant health problems, such as hypertension, owing to their brutal schedules.
And yet most women, needing the income, continue working and hide their pregnancies as long as possible, out of fear that supervisors will fire them when they find out.
This also takes an emotional toll.
Working mothers from rural villages report experiencing high levels of guilt, anxiety, and stress caused by being away from the children whom they often have to leave in their home village, because they cannot afford – in terms of time or money – to care for them in Dhaka.
Two out of five workers show suicidal tendencies.
Yet the factory health-care systems that we have studied do not treat mental illness as a serious problem.
In fact, most factories do not have any mental-health-care provisions at all for their workers.
As a result, most women suffer in silence.
Finally, our research identified a disturbing correlation between employment in the garment industry and violence (physical, emotional, and sexual) against women.
A staggering 43% of respondents said they had been sexually assaulted by a spouse during the previous year.
To put this figure in perspective, the national average for this form of violence is 13%.
While we don’t have the data for a conclusive assessment of why rates of abuse are so high in the garment trade, the data are consistent with the prevailing popular view that women in this field are somehow associated with sex work and sexual promiscuity.
There is no doubt that women in Bangladesh have earned a degree of autonomy and financial independence from their participation in the garment industry.
But, as our data illustrate, these gains have come at a cost.
And, although activists and industry insiders recognize that attitudes and abusive practices toward female workers must change, there is currently no consensus about how to proceed.
We think it is time to change that, and a good place to start would be by pushing multinational firms to make gender equality a high priority.
Many of the global brands that rely on Bangladesh’s factories have committed to gender parity in their corporate offices.
They should do the same on the production side, where managerial positions are occupied almost exclusively by men, a disparity that reinforces the gender imbalance elsewhere in society.
But perhaps the most important change to be made is to engage men in a dialogue on gender.
In several African countries, gender-sensitization initiatives have reduced discrimination and violence against women.
One program in West Africa, for example, brings husbands and wives together for mediated “dialogue sessions” to improve women’s role in financial decision-making.
To make similar gains in Bangladesh, profound changes in policies and programs are needed.
The garment industry and men more broadly must commit to the goal of women’s empowerment.
After nearly 40 years on the job, women are the driving force behind Bangladesh’s most important industry.
But at the moment, they are paying too high a physical and emotional price.

Electrifying Africa’s Labor Market
NAIROBI/PARIS – Africa is on the verge of an unemployment crisis portending profound economic, political, and social ramifications.
But the crisis can be averted, and one of the solutions may be as simple as turning on the lights.
Every year, some 13 million young people look for work in Africa, but only about three million of them find jobs.
The continent’s youth population is projected to double by 2050, to 840 million, and yet Africa’s schools and universities are not producing enough graduates with the technical skills to succeed in the workplace of tomorrow.
Although the African Development Bank (AfDB) hopes to create 25 million new jobs within a decade through its Jobs for Youth in Africa initiative, it is not immediately clear where those opportunities will come from.
But one industry is poised to fill the jobs gap: the renewable energy industry.
This industry – and especially small-scale power generation like rooftop solar panels and green mini-grids – has the potential to power African employment growth.
In fact, we calculate that up to one-fifth of the AfDB’s jobs commitment could be met by economic activity linked to the off-grid solar industry alone – through direct and indirect employment.
Worldwide, job growth in the renewables industry is booming, while employment in traditional power generation is shrinking (primarily owing to the closure of coal plants).
African countries should expect a similar trend as they work to achieve universal electricity access.
To meet this goal, the AfDB estimates that roughly 40% of the continent’s new connections – 75 million households – will need to come from off-grid solutions.
While investment in decentralized renewables in Africa is increasing, more than 600 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity.
Connecting these customers, most of whom live in rural areas, will require a huge number of skilled workers and entrepreneurs.
Although off-grid energy demand has the potential to create more than 4.5 million jobs globally, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, only about 76,000 renewable-energy jobs have been created in all of Africa, less than 1% of the 10.3 million globally.
If managed and supported properly, Africa’s renewables revolution could create jobs far beyond the energy sector itself.
Once Africa’s consumers have access to electricity, they will want home appliances and other goods, which will generate demand for new services and create even more opportunities for skilled workers.
Moreover, electrification can help stimulate growth in small- and medium-sized enterprises, which suffer disproportionately when power is expensive or unreliable.
With half of all African businesses owning or sharing a generator and citing electricity as a major constraint, decentralized renewables could keep Africa’s SMEs productive and their workers employed.
Off-grid solutions would also enable the launch of new businesses, especially in agriculture, and shorten their path to profitability.
Expanded access to renewable energy would benefit African countries in many other ways, too, such as by reducing poverty, improving gender equality, enhancing sanitation, and limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
As former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon often said, affordable and clean energy “will be essential” to meeting nearly all of the objectives set by the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
But achieving universal access will require a trained workforce, and at the moment, Africa suffers from a dearth of capable human capital.
Energy companies like ours – M-KOPA has over 800 full-time employees, for example – are already finding it difficult to hire “job-ready” talent for the renewables sector.
In nearly every region, African countries have been slow to ensure that the next generation of energy workers is ready; capacity building has been an afterthought.
This must change, and quickly.
Africa’s clean-energy future will require many skilled technicians, and governments need to start training them now.
Public-private partnerships, like Schneider Electric’s Access to Energy program, have trained many electricians globally, but only a fraction have been in Africa.
Two years ago, Akinwumi A. Adesina, the AfDB’s president, lamented that many African countries were “essentially training our youths for the jobs of yesterday, not the jobs of the future.”
Now is the time to reverse this pattern.
With dedicated support from governments, industry, civil society, and multilateral agencies, decentralized renewables can do more than illuminate a continent; they can also put it to work.

Three Global Steps to a Biden Climate Initiative
NEW YORK – American voters, who represent about 4% of the world’s population, will soon elect a president whose climate policies will affect not only everyone on Earth today, but also future generations.
A victory for former Vice President Joe Biden would be good for the planet – but that alone will not be enough.
Most climate scientists believe that humanity will self-destruct if we continue adding greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere at the rate we have been doing over the last few decades.
In 2015, the international community reached a landmark accord in Paris that committed almost all countries to major reductions in GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual scenario.
The United States played a leadership role in getting other countries on board – especially China, which pledged to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions around 2030.
Without the commitments from large developing countries, the Paris agreement would not be as significant.
Scientists knew that the Paris agreement was by itself insufficient to bring humanity into a comfort zone, because it only delayed rather than averted the time when the world’s climate would reach a dangerous tipping point.
The hope then was that governments would build on the accord in a series of progressively more ambitious future agreements.
But US President Donald Trump, elected in 2016, openly opposed America’s participation in the Paris agreement and started the process of withdrawing from it.
(The withdrawal is due to take effect on November 4, one day after the election.)
Trump’s decision set back the global climate effort in two ways.
First, it tacitly allowed other countries that wanted to water down their climate actions to do so without much resistance.
Second, it stopped any serious multilateral negotiations to upgrade the commitments made in Paris, because such efforts are neither meaningful nor possible without US participation and leadership.
Trump opposes the Paris agreement not because he or his supporters do not understand the need for it, but for narrow reasons.
Over the next few decades, the brunt of the climate disaster will be felt by countries in or near the tropics that are not rich enough to undertake sufficient adaptation measures.
Over 70% of the country of the Maldives, for example, could be under water before the end of the century.
But such victims are too abstract or foreign for many US voters.
Because reducing GHG emissions involves costly investments in renewable energy and reduced dependence on shale gas and coal, which Americapossesses in abundance, a narrow calculation might make US participation in the Paris agreement seem less appealing to some voters.
In addition, while reducing GHG emissions will mainly benefit future generations, the costs of doing so start now.
Finally, although a sea-level rise caused by climate change can create havoc for New York, San Francisco, Miami, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, these cities are rich enough to find ways to adapt and cope.
And some other regions in the US and Japan could actually benefit.
So, richer countries may not feel the same urgency to tackle the climate threat that many poorer ones do.
Biden, by contrast, has pledged to return the US to the Paris agreement if he becomes president.
But a US leader who regards climate change as a national-security threat still will be insufficient for global mitigation.
China’s recent declaration that it will go beyond its Paris commitment and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 is an encouraging step.
But we need all countries to do more collectively.
Given the difficulty of the negotiations that produced the Paris accord, how do we encourage countries to step up their mitigation efforts?
Three new tools could help.
First, whereas Trump’s tariffs were both inequitable and inefficient (and his tariffs on Chinese goods are illegal according to a recent WTO ruling), it may be productive for climate-conscious governments to impose tariffs on imports from countries with high GHG emissions on either a per capita or per-unit-of-GDP basis. Such levies would narrow the gap between the true global cost of GHG emissions and the immediate (and much smaller) cost currently incurred by emitters.
Second, international financial institutions – including the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank – should consider conditioning loans and assistance to member countries on ambitious GHG emission reductions.
These lenders can also organize more technical assistance to help member states devise and implement cost-effective ways to reduce GHG emissions, including a tradable emission-permit system.
In addition, special grants to least-developed countries could offset part of the cost of switching to more renewable energy sources.
Third, parallel to a shift to renewable energy, more innovation is needed to reduce the cost of carbon capture.
This will allow for some fossil-fuel-based electricity generation while eliminating the resulting GHG emissions.
Because many countries do not want to give up fossil fuels completely, CO2 capture needs to be scaled up.
Integrated gasification combined cycle technology plus carbon capture is a promising but currently expensive option.
Innovations that reduce costs have an important positive spillover for the world, implying a need to reward technical progress more generously.
At a minimum, we need to encourage green industrial policies that subsidize innovations that will help all countries to reduce GHG emissions.
The climate-change crisis is the greatest threat to humanity’s long-term viability.
With more sensible US leadership, new policy tools that increase the cost of GHG emissions, and stronger incentives to make carbon capture cheaper and more effective, the world will have a fighting chance of survival.

Donald Trump’s North Korean Family Values
ATLANTA – With every new US president arriving in Washington, DC, come a handful of counselors and aides whose personal ties, built over years and forged in election campaigns, give them pride of place in the administration.
From the “Irish Brotherhood” that brought John F. Kennedy to office to the “Berlin Wall” that guarded Richard Nixon’s door, close friends and confidantes have often outdone the administration’s biggest names.
But no American president has ever brought to the White House an inner circle dominated by his family – until Donald Trump.
Judging by Trump’s business history and presidential campaign – which featured few, if any, intimates outside his family – his adult children will have a major hand in his administration’s decisions, despite their lack of experience in international and domestic affairs.
After hiring and firing personnel and shaping strategy during the election campaign, Trump’s children have remained front and center in his transition team.
His daughter, Ivanka, joined the president-elect’s tête-à-tête with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
His son, Donald, Jr., played a role in picking Congressman Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the Interior in the new administration.
Now, Trump is taking his dynasty to the White House.
Ivanka is set to take over the First Lady’s office there.
Her husband, the real-estate investor Jared Kushner, just might be suited, if only in the eyes of his father-in-law, to serve as a special envoy to broker peace in the Middle East.
Yes, Donald, Jr. and his brother, Eric, will remain in New York to run the Trump Organization, which oversees their father’s diverse businesses; but Trump’s claim that his sons will remain at arm’s length strains credulity.
All of this has spurred questions about the Trump children’s capacity to leverage their father’s presidency to benefit the family business, with many fixating on whether Trump is violating conflict-of-interest or anti-nepotism rules.
But Trump regards such questions as essentially moot.
That is not surprising.
Trump’s management model has long been underpinned by a hereditary inner circle.
His adult children have spent their lives being groomed and promoted, and have operated at the pinnacle of the Trump Organization for years.
They now occupy three of the company’s board seats, with Trump occupying a fourth.
Given their standing in the company, and their relationship with their father, their influence in his administration should not be in doubt.
The remaining top-level positions are filled by long-time family retainers who, on average, have 17 years on the job.
Several have spent three decades at Trump’s elbow.
Compared to public companies of comparable size, the Trump Organization’s dynastic C-Suite and the longevity of its consiglieri are striking.
The lesson for any administration appointee should be clear: only loyalty comes close to heredity in winning and holding an executive role.
The record of the modern US presidency sheds little light on whether Trump’s family-driven leadership style will work.
Yet Trump is unlikely to weigh the pros and cons of stacking his inner circle with family members, not least because of his own experience: ever since his father brought him into the family business, he has never worked anywhere else.
Moreover, Trump is far from the only corporate boss who prefers to keep leadership “all in the family.”
A 2016 study by the Boston Consulting Group found that one-third of American companies with annual revenue of $1 billion or more are family-owned.
Of those, 40% are family-run.
There is also plenty of precedent for family-based leadership in government, though not in developed democracies.
From Kazakhstan to Congo, blood binds together ruling elites who share the spoils, guard against usurpers, and ensure that their children succeed them in power.
While it may seem far-fetched to compare the Trumps to, say, the Kims of North Korea – the world’s longest-running family dictatorship – plenty of similarities are likely to emerge.
Some already have.
The first rule of family dictatorships is that loyalty matters above all else.
Like the histrionic pledges of support required from North Korean commissars and generals for their leader Kim Jong-un, the Trump White House is likely to demand unswerving fealty to the clan.
That message has already been received loud and clear by incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.
Both have repeatedly affirmed their admiration for Kushner and vowed that he will be deeply involved in decisions, despite his utter lack of experience.
Second, tasks beat titles.
Like Kim, who has ignored the pecking order of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea to give his sister and brother high-ranking positions, Trump is likely to entrust his offspring with key assignments.
While nepotism laws will probably rule out official presidential appointments for Trump’s children and their spouses, that won’t matter much in practice; their de facto clout, as well as Trump’s own priorities, will quickly become apparent.
Indeed, their influence in advancing Trump’s major goals could easily overwhelm that of cabinet-level appointees, who would be wise to accommodate them.
Third, there will be unexpected promotions and abrupt purges.
In North Korea, all of this dictated from the top.
In his reality television persona, Trump’s enthusiastic firings and occasional Cinderella-like promotions of low-level employees provide an obvious parallel.
Under Trump, as under Kim, sputtering or failed policies are likely to have personnel consequences, though only those outside the family will face them.
Two weeks before the election, one of the Trump campaign’s top employees, Brad Parscale, suggested how a Trump White House would function.
“My loyalty is to the family,” Parscale said.
No one in Kim’s family could put it more succinctly.

The Poverty Line’s Battle Lines
WASHINGTON, DC – For a long time, as a college professor and then as the chief economic adviser to the Indian government, I was a happy user of the World Bank’s data on global poverty, tracking trends and analyzing cross-country patterns.
I seldom paused to think about how those numbers were computed.
Then, three years ago, I joined the World Bank as its Chief Economist.
It was like a customer, happily ordering dinner in a favorite restaurant, suddenly being asked to go into the kitchen and prepare the meal.
Being in the business of measuring poverty is a challenge for the World Bank.
If poverty declines, critics accuse us of trying to showcase our success.
If it rises, they say we are ensuring that we stay in business.
And if it stays the same, they accuse us of trying to avoid these two charges.
Fortunately, there is something liberating in knowing that you will be criticized for any outcome.
Still, as our team set about defining the global poverty line this year (and thus the incidence of poverty), I was acutely aware of the note of caution from Angus Deaton, this year’s Nobel laureate in economics: “I am not sure it is wise for the World Bank to commit itself so much to this project.”
I could see his point: This year’s poverty calculation was particularly momentous.
In 2011, new purchasing power parities (or PPPs, which essentially estimate how much $1 dollar buys in different countries) had been computed, and the data became available in 2014.
This was one reason to take stock of how we would adjust the global poverty line, estimate new poverty numbers, and publish them in our Global Monitoring Report, which was released in October.
A second reason is that the UN has included the eradication of chronic poverty in its new Sustainable Development Goals.
This means that our decision on where to draw the poverty line probably will influence not just the World Bank’s mission but also the development agenda of the UN and all countries around the world.
Clearly, as we crunched the numbers, we had a special, and daunting, responsibility to fulfill.
Our first task was to see how the global poverty line had been determined earlier.
In 2005, when the previous round of purchasing power parities was estimated, the method used was to take the national poverty lines of the 15 poorest countries, compute their average, and treat that as the global line.
This led to a global poverty line of $1.25.
The idea was that a poor person was anyone whose PPP-adjusted daily consumption fell short of $1.25.
The validity of this method has been questioned – and I have had my own reservations.
But where the line is drawn in the initial year is in some sense not that important.
Because there is no unique definition of poverty, what matters is to draw a line at some reasonable place and then hold the line constant in real (inflation-adjusted) terms so that we can track the performance of the world and individual countries over time.
Some critics argue that the 2005 poverty line of $1.25 was too low.
But what should alarm them is that in 2011, some 14.5% of the world’s population – one in every seven people – lived below it.
Given that we are already committed to the goal of ending extreme, chronic poverty by 2030, our first decision was to hold the yardstick for measuring poverty constant.
Since there had been inflation between the two rounds of the PPP computation, in 2005 and 2011, we would obviously have to raise the nominal poverty line to keep the real line constant.
However, doing this for the world as a whole is far from easy.
Which countries’ inflation should we use?
We ran two experiments: one was to inflate the poverty lines of the 15 countries used in 2005, using their respective inflation rates and then taking an average; the other was to do the same for 101 countries for which we had the necessary data.
These two methods raised the line to $1.88 and $1.90, respectively.
However, a third approach was possible: to raise the poverty line with the new PPP indices so that the incidence of global poverty remained unchanged (because PPP arguably tells us about parity across countries and should not change the absolute level of global poverty).
This exercise – and it was beginning to look like a strange alignment of the stars – resulted in a poverty line just above $1.90.
In short, by keeping to one decimal place, all three methods led to $1.9.
And that is the line we adopted.
We will not always have the good fortune to be able to use different methods and still arrive at virtually the same line.
Furthermore, poverty can and should be measured by many metrics other than money: life expectancy, educational attainment, health, and various other measures of human “functionings and capabilities” (as Amartya Sen calls them) are all important.
To tackle these problems in the future and broaden the World Bank’s poverty research, we have established the 24-member Commission on Global Poverty – chaired by Sir Tony Atkinson of the London School of Economics and Nuffield College, Oxford – which will submit its report next spring.
Measuring poverty attracts attention from both politicians and academic researchers – and we had an ample amount of both.
We were attentive to the politics of poverty, but we resisted political lobbying.
We took account of the suggestions of researchers, but we used our judgment.
One researcher was adamant that the poverty line should be $1.9149.
I decided that those last three digits were a bit excessive.

European Universities’ Identity Crisis
MADRID – Higher education in Europe today finds itself in a state of profound uncertainty.
What should universities’ primary focus be – research, professional training, or social inclusion?
Should governments invest more in higher education to underpin long-term economic growth?
Should universities be left alone to compete and survive (or not) in a global education marketplace?
Amid the debates about their future role, Europe’s universities must not lose sight of their individual identity, their traditions, and their sense of social purpose.
This will not be easy.
University administrators face pressures from above – European institutions and national governments – and from their own researchers, teachers, and students.
Moreover, the parameters of the debate are becoming hazy.
On one hand, universities are abiding by long-standing agreements with government; on the other, they face zealous reformers who seek market-based solutions that stress competition among institutions, encourage staff and student mobility, and emphasize student-centered learning.
Obviously, these outlooks generate very different implications for universities’ future.
Traditionally, universities undertook research, provided a professional education, and offered a country’s young people a cultural foundation as they entered society.
Today, none of these aims appears secure.
Indeed, the gravest danger to Europe’s universities is a prolonged period of confusion about their ultimate aims.
Seeking truth through observation, experimentation, rational argument, and mutual criticism has always been a raison d’être of universities.
Reflecting this, some European institutions are encouraged by government to try to match the research excellence attained by top universities in the United States.
But not all of Europe’s universities regard themselves primarily as research institutions.
Many prefer to focus on preparing their students for the world of work.
However, the skills that are now required outside academia are changing so rapidly that universities may struggle to marry the generic cognitive skills taught in the classroom – such as critical thinking, analytical reasoning, problem solving, and writing – with the professional expertise that is increasingly acquired in the workplace.
And if years of schooling do not translate into greater cognitive skills, then much of the economic justification for investing in higher education falls apart.
Universities have also had a public-service mission: to provide students with a cultural foundation for life.
This purpose may seem increasingly controversial in pluralistic Western societies, but universities should at least provide their students with an understanding of the models, history, and philosophical fundamentals with which to debate these issues.
Without a reasonable awareness of their socio-cultural environment, students may view universities merely as a place to pursue private goals, make useful connections, enjoy student life, and perhaps pick up a superficial sense of diversity.
Whichever path Europe’s universities take, maintaining a distinct identity in the face of global change and education reform will become increasingly difficult.
Researchers are no longer confined within their ivory towers, but work as part of complex global networks alongside private-sector participants.
Tenured professors, once central to the life and image of a college, are being replaced by part-time teachers who lack a strong connection to their institution.
Likewise, in the emerging conception of universities – one that draws heavily from the corporate world – educational “managers,” applying “best practices” (and always ready to move on to the next posting) – retain the most cursory regard for the institution’s life and traditions.
And students, seen as mere consumers of a service, are invited to exercise choice regarding teachers, curricula, and location.
Some may find these changes exciting.
But their purpose will be lost if pursuing them weakens the very identity of Europe’s universities, many of which are used to functioning in a world of state patronage and strict regulation.
Policymakers must be aware of the educational and cultural damage that continuous reforms – all justified in the future-oriented jargon of the day – can wreak.
Universities must protect their institutional memories, local traditions, and commitment to each new generation of students.
A loyal and grateful alumni network can help to ensure this.
The alternative is a formulaic educational experience that not only lacks individual character, but that is also devoid of moral purpose.

How Europe Can Sustain Russia Sanctions
MADRID – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine is a dramatic wake-up call for Europe.
The European Union can no longer be a passive player in global affairs.
It must reinforce its own security structure within the broader context of NATO.
The COVID-19 crisis offers important lessons in this regard.
The intuition behind Europe’s response to the pandemic was that a common, symmetric, external shock to economic policymaking called for common, internally coherent, and consensual solutions.
This translated into a political agreement to create a centralized spending initiative financed with funds raised by the European Commission.
The new Recovery and Resilience Facility provided EU member states with the means – including through fiscal transfers – to respond to the health crisis and its economic consequences.
In the face of Putin’s blitz, Europe urgently needs a similar mechanism to finance investment in its long-term safety, and to help member states bear the economic cost of enacting meaningful sanctions against Russia.
The steps needed to secure Europe geopolitically will be costly, and they will go beyond simply supporting our aging military forces.
Part of the cost will stem from the effects of sanctions, and part from the need to adapt to the new geopolitical environment.
Not all EU members have enough fiscal capacity to absorb these costs.
Some (such as Italy) have much higher levels of public debt, and others (such as Germany) are more exposed to the rebound effects of sanctions.
Moreover, no EU member can feasibly pursue rapid and full diversification away from Russian gas.
As former Russian President Dmitri Medvedev has threatened, Europeans face the prospect of skyrocketing gas prices.
And with Ukraine and Russia together accounting for almost 30% of global wheat exports, food also will be affected worldwide – a problem compounded by an increase in the price of fertilizers, of which Russia is a major producer.
The downside risks to the economy will therefore include new inflationary pressures on top of those associated with the post-pandemic reopening.
Facing the specter of stagflation, the European Central Bank may feel more pressure to tighten monetary policy.
If so, the expectation of rate increases might in turn force some countries into fiscal tightening, which would render meaningful additional security spending all but impossible.
Nonetheless, a united Europe is needed now more than ever to maintain sufficiently severe sanctions against Russia, and to mitigate the short-term pain from Russian counter-sanctions.
With European gas storage facilities still 30% full, and with the possibility of receiving additional liquefied natural gas (LNG), Europe can survive the winter even with an interruption of all Russian gas flows.
But to manage this worst-case scenario, European countries will need to show solidarity by sharing scarce resources with those most in need, and by extending EU financial support to the most-affected countries.
After that, two more measures will be needed to ensure longer-term solidarity on energy issues.
First, EU countries must (finally) build the gas interconnections that are needed to make the EU energy market more flexible and resilient to shocks.
For example, pipelines connecting Spain and France would enable the rest of Europe to tap into Iberia’s large LNG infrastructure.
Second, EU countries must turn gas storage into a strategic asset.
The companies that own storage sites should be required to fill them up ahead of winter, and EU member states should consider developing a regional strategic gas storage system like the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Europe also needs to prepare itself to welcome war refugees.
A mechanism will be needed for distributing potentially millions of refugees within the Union, and for supporting host countries financially.
One possible blueprint is the EU’s Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) initiative, which was rolled out during the pandemic to reinforce national social-security systems.
Moreover, Western companies and financial institutions hit hard by the effects of the war and new sanctions must not suffer liquidity crises.
The Russian economy is likely to be abruptly disconnected from Western markets, and the Ukrainian economy will deteriorate fast.
Many Western companies will be exposed to these developments and will need time and support to refocus their assets and business plans.
Europe’s response here should include activating new state aid exceptions under articles 107(3) and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
But it must not stop there.
As in the COVID-19 crisis, a straightforward suspension of the state-aid framework could produce a scenario in which rich countries are able to shield their markets much more than poorer countries can, undermining competition in the internal market.
Europe therefore needs a facility to provide equal backing to all affected companies and financial institutions.
Finally, we cannot shy away from updating the aging European military infrastructure.
In the past, EU countries have benefited from joint military procurement on specific projects through the European Defence Agency.
This approach now needs to be scaled up substantially and backed by common resources, with guidelines that all assets purchased be used to reform and modernize the national units participating in EU-level defense through EU Battlegroup or NATO assignments.
The COVID-19 Recovery and Resilience Facility was successful because it accounted for different interests in the name of fighting a common problem.
It should now be augmented with a security facility to provide financial support for the difficult measures that will be needed to sustain a united front vis-à-vis Russia.
In addition to loans to deal with short-term issues such as illiquidity, there should be common spending to finance structural adaptation over the medium term, especially to support defense spending, refugee resettlement, and the energy transition.
Accordingly, the facility should be financed with EU bonds, which should be eligible for purchase by the ECB – thus also serving as a much-needed EU safe asset.
The Russia-Ukraine crisis will require rethinking how European countries allocate their budgets and govern key sectors, some of which are only loosely connected with defense and security.
This transition is not a choice, but rather a necessary response to dark times.

India’s Economic Hotspots
MUMBAI – India’s economy could soon be on the move again.
The new government is re-establishing fiscal discipline and energizing the bureaucracy, fueling optimism that rising business confidence will re-activate investment, particularly in infrastructure.
But India’s overall growth prospects conceal a patchwork of economic opportunities that exist within states, districts, cities, and even towns – opportunities that companies can uncover only with careful research.
India’s economic data are promising.
Annual average GDP growth is forecast to range from 6.4% to 7.7% until 2025.
This compares favorably with last year’s 4.7% rate, and is close to the 7.7% average recorded in the decade up to 2012.
Moreover, it contrasts sharply with the expectations of secular stagnation in the developed world.
This acceleration would place India among the world’s fastest-growing large economies and increase the number of Indian consumers who can afford discretionary items from 27 million in 2012 to 89 million in 2025.
But the potential is far from uniform.
According to a new report, more than half of India’s GDP growth between now and 2025 will come from just eight states (Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttarakhand), home to just 31% of the country’s population.
Along with four dynamic city-states (New Delhi, Goa, Chandigarh, and Pondicherry), these states will be home to 50 million consumers, or 57% of the country’s middle-class households.
Indeed, per capita GDP in India’s highest-performing regions could grow to twice the national level.
This reflects several factors, including rapid urbanization, sustained investment in skills and infrastructure, and a shift from agriculture to industries such as automotive components, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, financial, and IT-enabled services.
By 2025, the economies of these regions will resemble those of middle-income countries.
Maharashtra’s consumer market of 128 million will wield purchasing power similar to that now seen in Brazil.
New Delhi’s 22 million people will boast living standards similar to today’s Russia.
Slightly less dramatically, though still significant, per capita GDP in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, based on current trends, is forecast to reach 0.7-1.2 times the national average by 2025, swelling the number of middle-class consumers four-fold, to 16 million.
By contrast, the weakest-performing states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand, with per capita GDP of under 0.7 times India’s average, will struggle with low incomes and high population growth, unless they improve their governance and investment trajectory significantly.
But investors seeking the best growth opportunities will have to search beyond states’ headline figures and scrutinize India’s districts more closely, especially urban clusters and their hinterlands.
We have identified 49 such high-growth clusters, located in 183 districts nationwide.
In 2012, these areas accounted for half of India’s population, 70% of its GDP, and 71% of consumers.
They are also home to 250 of India’s 450 cities with populations above 100,000.
Interestingly, one-third of these clusters can be found in states that have delivered low to medium economic performance, or are located close to smaller, lesser-known towns in better-performing states.
The Nellore cluster in Andhra Pradesh, for example, has paddy, tobacco, groundnut, mango, and sugarcane farms.
The Bikaner cluster in Rajasthan is rich in oilseed and the quarrying and production of Makarana marble and limestone.
The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.
The location of these lesser-known clusters underscores the point that investors, seeking low-cost real estate and a skilled workforce, should look more carefully at India’s economic geography when deciding where to place their operations.
These locations could eventually become knowledge-based industry or services hubs, similar to those of large Indian cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune – only cheaper.
As they continue to develop, India’s dynamic economic clusters will themselves need to invest in modern sanitation and water systems, education and health, airports, railways, and road links.
As such, they offer investors opportunities in many sectors, including consumer goods, financial services, housing, and infrastructure.
Given their structural advantages – including proximity to large urban centers for some – these clusters could generate some of the best returns on investment anywhere in India.
Companies hoping to catch India’s next growth wave might want to consider areas that seldom feature on investment lists, but that might offer better value than marquee destinations.

Revolutionary Patience
MADRID – On December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi set himself alight in Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia.
Within weeks, the popular revolt triggered by Bouazizi’s act had spread far beyond Tunisia, engulfing much of the Arab world.
In Europe, Ukraine and other troubled countries, such as Bosnia, began their long and still incomplete transitions to democracy a quarter-century ago.
The Arab world, by contrast, has logged a mere three years of transition – the blink of an eye in historical terms.
Still, there have already been significant changes, and the region is advancing – though the destination remains unknown.
As in other parts of the world, Arab countries need time to attain the democracy and pluralism their peoples seek.
They will achieve their goals – but not in a mere three years.
In fact, events in today’s Middle East continue to be shaped by the radical changes brought about after World War I. Previously, most Arabs had been grouped together under various caliphates.
After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, two nation-states (Iran and Turkey) emerged, while the Arabs were distributed among 22 new countries, generally under British or French colonial domination.
Once the colonies had achieved independence – Saudi Arabia, today a Sunni regional power, was created in 1932 – a new attempt was made to unite the Arab nation by means of the political Islam that emerged in the 1920’s in response to the fall of the Ottoman Caliphate.
The phenomenon took many forms, including the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928.
At the same time, efforts at nation-building along secular lines were reflected in Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s pan-Arabism and the Syrian Baath Party, resulting in the establishment of the United Arab Republic, a union between Egypt and Syria that lasted from 1958 to 1961.
A half-century later, the simultaneous revolts in the Arab world were the result of neither political tendency, instead reflecting broad popular rejection of dysfunctional and corrupt authoritarian governments.
But, with Syria immersed in a brutal civil war that has claimed more than 130,000 lives already, Libya on the verge of collapse, and Egypt returning power to the army and proscribing the Muslim Brotherhood, Tunisia has been the only success.
Tunisia adopted its new constitution on January 27, thus clearing the way for what will be the most secular and fairest elections in any of the region’s countries.
The new constitution is the most modern in the Arab world, the fruit of a non-violent transition.
With a small, well-educated population, Tunisia has become the exception.
Egypt’s government, by banning the Muslim Brotherhood, has taken the country backward since the military coup that overthrew President Mohamed Morsi last July.
The Egyptian process, however, should not be considered merely a return to the pre-2011 status quo; rather, developments constitute what could be characterized as an ascending spiral that, while turning back on itself, nevertheless advances.
The generational split within Egypt is evident: social mobilization has given young Egyptians valuable political experience, and this represents a key difference from the three decades of former President Hosni Mubarak’s rule.
The same could be said of Syria, though the spiral there has been an unremittingly downward one, and any reversal remains blocked, particularly since the failure of the second round of peace negotiations in Geneva.
More generally, lack of pluralism and the inability to share power are holding back the transitions.
With the exception of Tunisia, this can be seen to varying degrees in all of the affected countries.
In Egypt, both the army – whether under Mubarak or Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi – and the Islamists have demonstrated that they want all power for themselves.
Political pluralism cannot be imposed.
Societies must demand it and build the lasting institutions needed to preserve it.
This process can take many years, making it crucial not to lose historical perspective.
The situation in each country was different when the revolts began.
Countries with homogenous societies, such as Tunisia, have suffered only minimal violence, unlike socially heterogonous countries, such as Syria.
Nor are there any consolidated regional structures to which the transition countries can adhere; and there are few local models – with the exception of Turkey, for example – that can be used to help democracy and pluralism take root.
Indeed, the context in which these transitions were set in motion was – and remains –unfavorable compared to those taking place in Europe.
Unlike the Arab countries, Eastern Europe and the Balkans benefited from a common starting point and a common path forward: all are part of a continent that has taken historic steps toward integration since World War II.
That has given them a common destination as well, both politically (accession to the European Union) and in terms of their security (through NATO).
But the situations in Bosnia and Ukraine are still very fluid.
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 23 years after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the post-communist transition is still incomplete.
We cannot expect results in the Middle East in three years that have not been achieved in Europe in a quarter-century.
Despite the backsliding in Egypt and the intolerable violence in Syria, the region is evolving at its own pace in a complex, changing, and unstable geopolitical context.
A patient strategy and an unwavering dedication to pluralism are fundamental, whether in Kyiv or Cairo.

US Democracy Under Concerted Attack
NEW YORK – The United States has been a constantly evolving democracy ever since it was founded in 1776, but its survival as a democracy is now gravely endangered.
A set of loosely interconnected developments at home and abroad is responsible for this crisis.
From abroad, the US is threatened by repressive regimes led by Xi Jinping in China and Vladimir Putin’s Russia who want to impose an autocratic form of government on the world.
But the threat to the US from the domestic enemies of democracy is even greater.
They include the current Supreme Court, which is dominated by far-right extremists, and Donald Trump’s Republican Party, which placed those extremists on the Court.
What qualifies the majority of the Court as extremists?
It is not merely their decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that recognized a woman’s right to choose whether to give birth.
What qualifies them as extremists is the arguments they used to justify their decision and the indications they gave of how far they might be willing to go in carrying out those arguments.
Justice Samuel Alito, the author of the majority opinion, based his ruling on the assertion that the Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights that were generally recognized in 1868, when the amendment was ratified.
But this argument endangers many other rights that have been recognized since then, among them the right to contraception, same-sex marriage, and LGBTQ rights.
Carried to its logical conclusion, this line of reasoning could even allow states to ban inter-racial marriage, as some did until 1967.
It is also clear that this Court intends to mount a frontal attack on the executive branch.
One of the most consequential rulings of the Court’s just-completed term denied the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations needed to combat climate change.
It doesn’t take long to find the common denominator in the Court’s recent decisions: support causes promoted by Trump’s Republican Party and weaken or outlaw causes favored by the Democratic Party.
Consider gun laws.
The Court’s radical wing listens closely to the pro-gun lobby.
So, though a recent epidemic of mass shootings created such a national outcry that even some Republicans supported a new federal gun law, the Court compensated the National Rifle Association for the loss by striking down a longstanding New York law that placed strict restrictions on carrying concealed handguns (New York State immediately passed new gun laws, that are likely to end up before the Supreme Court).
The Supreme Court used to be among the most highly respected institutions in the US.
Through its recent decisions, the extremist majority has driven its approval rating to a historic low, and disapproval of the Court to new highs.
The dissenting opinion in the case that overturned Roe flatly stated that the majority decision “undermines the court’s legitimacy.”
Unfortunately, the minority is likely to remain in the minority for a long time, because the extremists are younger and hold a 6-3 majority.
There is only one way to rein in the Supreme Court: throw the Republican Party out of office in a landslide.
That would allow Congress to protect through legislation the rights that had been entrusted to the protection of the Supreme Court.
It is now clear that doing so was a big mistake.
Congress must act, starting with protecting a woman’s right to choose.
If the filibuster must be amended to achieve that, so be it.
But when it comes to organizing a landslide victory against the radicalized Republicans, opponents face almost insuperable obstacles.
Republicans have not only stacked the Supreme Court and many lower courts with extremist judges.
In states such as Florida, Georgia, and Texas, they have enacted a raft of laws that make voting very difficult.
While these laws focus on disenfranchising African Americans, other minorities, and young voters generally, their ultimate goal is to help Republicans win elections.
As a Florida federal judge recently wrote in striking down one of these laws, they were enacted “with the intent to restructure Florida’s election system in ways that favor the Republican Party over the Democratic Party.”
These laws would be bad enough if they only targeted who can vote.
But Republicans are now going even further, by attacking the vote-counting and election-certification process.
From changing the law to make subversion of the electoral system easier, to recruiting believers in Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him to oversee the process, we are watching Republicans attack our system of democracy from every angle.
And here, too, the radical Supreme Court has done its part, gutting the federal Voting Rights Act and allowing naked partisan redistricting to weaken minority voting power.
Fortunately, I am not alone in claiming that the survival of democracy in the US is gravely endangered.
The American public has been aroused by the decision overturning Roe.
But people need to recognize that decision for what it is: part of a carefully laid plan to turn the US into a repressive regime, particularly targeting women regardless of the devastating consequences.
We must do everything we can to prevent that.
This fight ought to include many people who voted for Trump in the past.
I am a supporter of the Democratic Party, but this is not a partisan issue.
It is about reestablishing a functioning two-party political system which is at the core of American democracy.

Freeing German Democracy
BERLIN – The spectacle surrounding the recent talks to form a new coalition government in Germany is a bellwether of voter discontent.
The power games, pork barreling, and compromises that have been reached without public debate all underscore the disconnect between Germany’s mainstream parties and the electorate – driving voters directly into the hands of populists.
As a result, Germany’s political fringe is blossoming.
The far-right Alternative für Deutschland and the left-wing Die Linke hold a combined total of about a quarter of the Bundestag’s seats.
The emerging grand coalition – which includes the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD) – holds just over 50%, making it significantly less grand than in the previous two governments.
The AfD, in particular, can’t believe its luck.
The party – which is, at best, only partly loyal to democracy – appears set to become the largest opposition group in the Bundestag.
For a party that did not even qualify for parliamentary representation until last September’s election, such a prominent position was beyond their wildest dreams.
Should the grand coalition take the helm, as expected, the parliament of affluent and economically stable Germany would confront the same type of divisiveness that, by shifting power to the fringes and shrinking the political center, has weakened democracy in other countries.
This has already occurred in the United States, where the emergence of more extreme voices has undermined cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium.
This is not to say that the Bundestag will suddenly become as dysfunctional as today’s US Congress.
But the seeds of democratic paralysis are being planted.
In some ways, this situation has been a long time coming.
Under previous grand coalitions, the Bundestag has served less as a platform for open discussion of diverse views and preferred outcomes than as a machine for passing laws.
The emerging coalition’s 167-page agreement, which spells out in striking detail the future government’s agenda, indicates that the authorities’ focus during the next four years will, once again, be confined to enacting previously agreed policies, not on promoting deliberation and reflection on public issues.
This closed-door policy has deepened the divide between the political class and voters.
As for what is driving it, there are two culprits: the rise of coalition agreements and the changing party system.
A coalition agreement spelling out some of the main items for the upcoming legislative period was used first by the CDU and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the early 1960s. A coalition committee was established to ensure that the agreed measures made it through parliament.
Over time, however, such agreements became increasingly detailed and complex; what had been a road map became a contract.
The coalition committee, meanwhile, became increasingly powerful behind the scenes.
These developments, though controversial, were never fully challenged; on the contrary, they became de rigueur for legislative politics in Germany, causing the Bundestag to shift focus from conducting open debate to enacting previously agreed decisions.
Until a few years ago, this shift in focus for the Bundestag was not particularly problematic.
But the main political parties have lately been losing their foothold in local communities, with the CDU/CSU and the SPD now relying on significantly lower membership.
As a result, their decisions have become increasingly detached from the will of the people.
The CDU and CSU leadership, not bound by a party vote, have already signaled their acceptance of the coalition pact.
But one hopes that SPD members reject the agreement on which they are now voting (the postal ballot closes on March 2).
A failed agreement would probably bring greater political instability, but it would ultimately strengthen German democracy.
If the agreement fails, Germany might hold a fresh election – a risky option, to be sure, as recent polls indicate that the AfD could win an even larger share of the vote, while support for the CDU and the SPD could decline.
Alternatively, Chancellor Angela Merkel could lead a minority government – the first in the Federal Republic’s nearly 70-year history – which would have to submit every policy proposal for parliamentary debate, with the risk of being blocked.
Under a minority government, every debate could lead to the government’s fall.
Yet this could work well for many less controversial proposals, while creating a new tradition of shifting, rather than fixed, coalitions.
Over time, such an arrangement could bring significant advantages, even institutional innovations, with the potential to challenge the stifling practice of coalition agreements and closed-door committees to enforce them.
German democracy is being strangled by strict coalition contracts.
In order to allow it to breathe, while closing the gap between the political class and the electorate, Germans must focus on creating more open and flexible legislative agendas that require genuine debate, out in the open, in the Bundestag.

Responding to Ebola
NEW YORK – The horrific Ebola epidemic in at least four West African countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria) demands not only an emergency response to halt the outbreak; it also calls for re-thinking some basic assumptions of global public health.
We live in an age of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that can spread quickly through global networks.
We therefore need a global disease-control system commensurate with that reality.
Fortunately, such a system is within reach if we invest appropriately.
Ebola is the latest of many recent epidemics, also including AIDS, SARS, H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu, and others.
AIDS is the deadliest of these killers, claiming nearly 36 million lives since 1981.
Of course, even larger and more sudden epidemics are possible, such as the 1918 influenza during World War I, which claimed 50-100 million lives (far more than the war itself).
And, though the 2003 SARS outbreak was contained, causing fewer than 1,000 deaths, the disease was on the verge of deeply disrupting several East Asian economies including China’s.
There are four crucial facts to understand about Ebola and the other epidemics.
First, most emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, meaning that they start in animal populations, sometimes with a genetic mutation that enables the jump to humans.
Ebola may have been transmitted from bats; HIV/AIDS emerged from chimpanzees; SARS most likely came from civets traded in animal markets in southern China; and influenza strains such as H1N1 and H7N9 arose from genetic re-combinations of viruses among wild and farm animals.
New zoonotic diseases are inevitable as humanity pushes into new ecosystems (such as formerly remote forest regions); the food industry creates more conditions for genetic recombination; and climate change scrambles natural habitats and species interactions.
Second, once a new infectious disease appears, its spread through airlines, ships, megacities, and trade in animal products is likely to be extremely rapid.
These epidemic diseases are new markers of globalization, revealing through their chain of death how vulnerable the world has become from the pervasive movement of people and goods.
Third, the poor are the first to suffer and the worst affected.
The rural poor live closest to the infected animals that first transmit the disease.
They often hunt and eat bushmeat, leaving them vulnerable to infection.
Poor, often illiterate, individuals are generally unaware of how infectious diseases – especially unfamiliar diseases – are transmitted, making them much more likely to become infected and to infect others.
Moreover, given poor nutrition and lack of access to basic health services, their weakened immune systems are easily overcome by infections that better nourished and treated individuals can survive.
And “de-medicalized” conditions – with few if any professional health workers to ensure an appropriate public-health response to an epidemic (such as isolation of infected individuals, tracing of contacts, surveillance, and so forth) – make initial outbreaks more severe.
Finally, the required medical responses, including diagnostic tools and effective medications and vaccines, inevitably lag behind the emerging diseases.
In any event, such tools must be continually replenished.
This requires cutting-edge biotechnology, immunology, and ultimately bioengineering to create large-scale industrial responses (such as millions of doses of vaccines or medicines in the case of large epidemics).
The AIDS crisis, for example, called forth tens of billions of dollars for research and development – and similarly substantial commitments by the pharmaceutical industry – to produce lifesaving antiretroviral drugs at global scale.
Yet each breakthrough inevitably leads to the pathogen’s mutation, rendering previous treatments less effective.
There is no ultimate victory, only a constant arms race between humanity and disease-causing agents.
So, is the world ready for Ebola, a newly lethal influenza, a mutation of HIV that could speed the transfer of the disease, or the development of new multi-drug-resistant strains of malaria or other pathogens?
The answer is no.
Though investment in public health increased significantly after 2000, leading to notable successes in the fights against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, there has recently been a marked shortfall in global spending on public health relative to need.
Donor countries, failing to anticipate and respond adequately to new and ongoing challenges, have subjected the World Health Organization to a debilitating budget squeeze, while funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has fallen far short of the sums needed to win the war against these diseases.
Here is a shortlist of what urgently needs to be done.
First, the United States, the European Union, the Gulf countries, and East Asian states should establish a flexible fund under WHO leadership to combat the current Ebola epidemic, probably at an initial level of $50-$100 million, pending further developments.
This would allow a rapid public-health response that is commensurate to the immediate challenge.
Second, donor countries should quickly expand both the Global Fund’s budget and mandate, so that it becomes a global health fund for low-income countries.
The main goal would be to help the poorest countries establish basic health systems in every slum and rural community, a concept known as Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
The greatest urgency lies in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where health conditions and extreme poverty are worst, and preventable and controllable infectious diseases continue to rage.
In particular, these regions should train and deploy a new cadre of community health workers, trained to recognize disease symptoms, provide surveillance, and administer diagnoses and appropriate treatments.
At a cost of just $5 billion per year, it would be possible to ensure that well-trained health workers are present in every African community to provide lifesaving interventions and respond effectively to health emergencies like Ebola.
Finally, high-income countries must continue to invest adequately in global disease surveillance, the WHO’s outreach capacities, and life-saving biomedical research, which has consistently delivered massive benefits for humanity during the past century.
Despite tight national budgets, it would be reckless to put our very survival on the fiscal chopping block.

Financial Stars Behind Bars?
CHICAGO – Hardly a day goes by without a settlement between a bank and a US government agency or regulator.
The latest one is between Bank of America and the government-backed mortgage underwriter Fannie Mae: $3.55 billion in cash; $6.75 billion in repurchases of bad mortgages that Countrywide, later acquired by BoA, sold to Fannie; and an additional $1.3 billion in cash to resolve Fannie’s servicing issues with BoA.
And yet, as in most settlements, BoA did not admit any fault.
Was BoA tripped up by bad luck or sloppiness?
Or did it and other financial institutions behave with intent to defraud investors?
As a result of the settlement, we will never learn the truth (at least the version that is established beyond a reasonable doubt in open court).
In each settlement, the investigations are stopped, and whatever has been found is sealed.
Fortunately, academic research may be able to shed some light on this important matter.
In a recent paper, the economists Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru, and James Witkin compare the characteristics of securitized mortgages as they were disclosed to investors at the time of sale with these loans’ characteristics as they were recorded in the banks’ proprietary databases.
The data cover non-agency residential mortgages, which are not the same as those targeted by the settlement, and the data come from a pool of banks, so we do not know which banks were present.
But their data are similar enough to enable us to learn a lot about what was going on.
If the massive wave of defaults on securitized mortgages was purely the result of bad luck, we would expect that the characteristics reported to investors would not differ from those recorded in the banks’ databases.
This is especially true of characteristics that are relevant to default risk, such as whether the borrower was an owner or an investor, or whether there was a second lien on the property.
In fact, the authors find that more than 6% of mortgage loans misreport the borrower’s occupancy status, while 7% do not disclose second liens.
Of course, any database contains errors.
Are these errors large enough to be worrisome?
And how can we be sure that the banks knowingly misrepresented this information, rather than that they merely were sloppy in reporting it?
The authors provide some interesting evidence in this context.
They show, for example, that the misrepresentation is correlated with higher defaults down the line: delinquent payments on misreported loans are more than 60% higher than on loans that are otherwise similar.
Thus, the errors do not seem to be random, but purposeful.
What the authors do not find is also interesting.
The degree of misrepresentation seems to be unrelated to the incentives provided to the top management and to the quality of risk-management practices inside these firms.
In fact, all reputable intermediaries in their sample exhibit a significant degree of misrepresentation.
Thus, the problem does not seem to be limited to a few bad apples, but is pervasive.
This makes a solution more difficult to achieve.
After all, if the financial industry’s leaders are misleading investors, it is the culture of the entire industry that needs to be changed.
Unfortunately, these giant settlements are unlikely to make a difference.
They are paid by shareholders and taxpayers (most of these settlements are tax-deductible), leaving the people who were ultimately responsible not only to walk away, but to walk away very rich.
For example, Angelo Mozilo received almost $470 million during his tenure as CEO of Countrywide Financial.
As far as I know, he paid nothing of BoA’s $11.6 billion settlement cost.
Mozilo did settle with the SEC, but on different charges (insider trading).
And he paid only $47.5 million of the $67.5 million settlement, owing to a $20 million indemnification agreement that was part of his employment contract.
Why have Mozilo and others been allowed to pay a relative pittance and avoid criminal proceedings?
A few prominent criminal convictions have sent a powerful signal in the fight against insider trading.
If the target is an industry-wide culture of deception, shouldn’t the criminal justice system be mobilized against banks’ mortgage fraud as well?

The Ideology Trap
LOS ANGELES – President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency at the southern border of the United States – where there is no emergency at all – in order to access funding to build the wall that he promised his supporters during his 2016 election campaign.
It is yet another example of the enduring – and dangerous – tension between reason and ideology in policymaking.
Evidence-based policies, whatever their limitations, always stand a better chance of succeeding than ideologically-driven policies, because they allow for adaptation to changing conditions and new data.
Policies born from rigid principles, by contrast, may not be in line with reality at all.
History is littered with the disastrous consequences of choosing ideology over reality.
Notably, Adolf Hitler did not believe that science could satisfy the German Volk; Germany needed to conquer a vast Lebensraum, which required turning Wagnerian myths of Teutonic supremacy into policies aimed at imperial domination.
Joseph Stalin, the head of another ideologically-based regime, prevailed over the Nazis precisely because he departed from absolute imperatives and based his war objectives on cold, rational self-interest.
As for the US, Trump is hardly the first president to choose faith over reason.
Like Trump, President George W. Bush believed that his presidency was part of a divine plan and launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of what he himself called a “crusade.”
Bush’s 2002 national security strategy was explicitly guided by America’s principles, rather than its interests.
Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, took that to heart: in 2003, he rejected Iran’s “grand bargain” proposal – which would have ended its nuclear program and subversive foreign policy – on the grounds that the US would not “negotiate with evil.”
The Trump administration and, more broadly, the US Republican Party, is upholding this tradition.
No amount of evidence showing that immigrants have been central to America’s success will satisfy Trump’s nativist base.
Circumventing the US Constitution to build an expensive, ecologically disastrous, and wholly unnecessary wall might.
Likewise, many Republicans, including Trump, continue to deny the threat posed by climate change, rejecting the near-universal scientific consensus.
In the past, Trump has even indulged the growing anti-vaccine movement, having tweeted repeatedly about a potential link between vaccines and autism, despite there being zero evidence of such a connection.
And Republicans argue that the US, despite being the world’s richest country, cannot afford to ensure universal access to affordable health care, which in any case would amount to a socialist assault on personal freedom.
US Republicans use similar arguments to oppose making higher education more affordable.
Student debt, at $1.5 trillion, is now second only to mortgage debt as America’s largest consumer debt category, and yet subsidizing tuition the way mortgages are subsidized is anathema.
The same goes for tax policy, with Republicans consistently advocating lower taxes for the highest earners, despite clear evidence that the benefits do not “trickle down” to the rest of the economy.
The US is not alone.
In the United Kingdom, the entire Brexit drama has been driven by zealots.
Clinging to an anachronistic view of Britain as a major global power, the Brexiteers argue that the European Union is holding the UK back.
New trade arrangements with the Commonwealth – which, in their view, is still essentially the British empire – and emerging powers like China would, they argue, allow the UK to reclaim, independently, its rightful place on the world stage.
As ideological zealots are wont to do, the Brexiteers have consistently disregarded the facts.
None of them has been able to put forward a coherent or feasible plan for realizing their vision of a full break with the EU.
Yet many, such as the Conservative Michael Gove, blithely deride “experts,” as if knowledge and experience were not worth bringing to bear on the issue.
Arguably, Brexit fanaticism among Conservatives – and even the Labour Party’s lack of a strong stance on the issue – stems partly from the UK’s legacy of disengagement from Europe in the 1930s.
At that time, many British politicians focused on the threat posed to the UK by the Nazis’ apparent determination to alter the international balance of power.
Today, Europe poses no such threat.
Yet the British philosopher John Gray, for example, has portrayed Brexit as the UK’s best defense against a reenactment of Europe’s “dark” dictatorial past.
A total collapse of the EU is inevitable, many Brexiteers believe.
Leaving Europe to be ruled by some type of Russian-Eurasian empire would be worth it, as long as Britannia were again ruling the seas.
A similar combination of haughty detachment and anachronistic fantasy is displayed by Catalan secessionists toward Spain. Catalans believe themselves to be far more industrious and inventive than – and even racially superior to – the supposedly lazy and unproductive Spaniards.
Moreover, they argue, Spaniards are more prone to authoritarianism. And in terms of its commitment to stifling Catalonia’s creativity and entrepreneurship, Spain’s democratic government is little different from Francisco Franco’s regime.
Catalans pride themselves on their seny – ancestral wisdom and level-headedness – and the British on their common sense.
But Catalan secessionists and Brexiteers have locked themselves – and their fellow citizens – in an ideological straitjacket.
Ideology is a powerful tool for packaging a broad political agenda, swaying public opinion, and assessing alternative goals.
But faith-based fixations almost invariably lead to bad policies, especially at a time of rapid economic change and deepening geopolitical uncertainty.
As the American psychologist Abraham Maslow famously put it, “it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”
That, as Trump might say with a straight face, is how walls get built.

The UK’s Hard Brexit Choices Have Arrived
LONDON – Since the United Kingdom left the European Union, relations with its continental neighbors have gone from bad to worse.
On both sides, a toxic blend of distrust and nationalism increasingly infuses almost every contentious issue.
On the EU side, both the European Commission and several member states have woefully mishandled the rollout of the bloc’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
The EU has directed its threats of vaccine protectionism principally at the UK, whose vaccination campaign has so far gone well, while individual European governments have damagingly criticized the efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.
The complaints about the vaccine, developed by world-renowned experts at the University of Oxford, fly in the face of objective scientific evidence, thus inevitably raising suspicions of anti-British sentiment.
Moreover, they have made some Europeans reluctant to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and stirred up anti-vaccine sentiment more generally, thereby all but guaranteeing further avoidable COVID-19 deaths.
Many European governments took too long to come to their senses and restart their rollout of the vaccine with the full backing of health regulators.
The UK government, for its part, has again deliberately breached the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU that Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed early last year.
The UK has chosen to be outside the EU’s customs union and single market, while the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) remains in both.
So, the only way to avoid re-establishing a border between the Republic and Northern Ireland (which would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the UK province) is for Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union with a border of some sort between it and the British mainland.
Johnson signed up for this – something that his predecessor, Theresa May, refused to do – and then denied that there would be such a border.
Now, his European minister, David Frost (who is to diplomacy what a chainsaw is to origami), has announced that the UK will ignore the Withdrawal Agreement until it gets what it wants.
This stance confounds patient efforts to find ways to ease the inevitable problems that will arise from having a border in the Irish Sea.
So, what should have been a quiet period of nurturing post-Brexit UK-EU relations has turned into a barroom brawl.
Meanwhile, Johnson’s government recently spelled out how the UK will use its supposed freedom outside the Union in a policy document that attempts to flesh out the concept of “Global Britain” – as if the country had not had global interests and influence for centuries.
It is an elegantly written essay, shot through with well-known Johnsonian traits.
For example, it faithfully reflects his predilection for attempting to have his cake and eat it – and thus avoid hard choices.
But with almost all serious economists and business leaders expecting slower economic growth for the foreseeable future (as a result of Britain having left its main export market), hard choices will not avoid the UK.
It is not surprising that the government has not released an official projection of Brexit’s economic impact; if the figures were good, they would be published in bold.
Although few think that the UK economy will fall off a cliff, goods exports to the EU declined by 40% in January – immediately after new trading rules between the UK and the bloc came into force.
Obviously, some of this decrease was due to the pandemic, teething problems with new UK-EU border controls, and end-of-year stockpiling.
But no one will be surprised if the trend continues.
While ministers hunt for excuses, businesses face higher costs, more red tape, and delayed supplies.
“Global Britain” will apparently get around such problems by finding new markets in Asia.
Johnson’s policy paper suggests that the UK is shifting its trade and security focus eastward.
Having spent a significant part of my life working in Asia and on relationships with Asian countries – notably India, China, and Japan – I am well disposed to the idea in principle.
But what does it mean in practice?
New business in Asia cannot possibly replace all the business the UK currently risks losing in Europe.
There is no tunnel between Folkestone and New Delhi, and there are not 10,000 goods trucks a day shuttling between Dover and Shanghai.
Despite spectacular improvements in technology, countries invariably trade more with their close neighbors than with faraway friends.
Moreover, EU membership did not stop the UK from doing business with Asia in the past.
But whereas Germany’s goods exports to China in 2019 totaled €96 billion ($115 billion), the UK’s amounted to just £25.1 billion ($35 billion).
And while UK exports to China have increased by an annual average of 3.7% in real terms since 1980, China’s exports to Britain have grown by over 9% per year in the same period, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Stronger UK-China trade ties would present Johnson with another hard choice.
Will Britain continue to stand with other liberal democracies like the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan in trying to contain the threat that China poses to its region and the international rule of law?
Or will it kowtow whenever President Xi Jinping’s regime stamps its feet?
Those of us urging the UK to make a choice in this regard are not calling for a cold war with China, as Johnson suggests, but rather for stewardship of our relationships with all those who want to constrain China’s cruel, brutish, and untrustworthy behavior.
Besides cake-ism, the government’s policy review reflects another characteristic Johnsonian feature: a chasm between aspirations and reality that cannot be bridged by make-believe and mendacity.
The paper calls for the UK to become a global leader in science and technology, for example.
But on the same day that the government announced this goal, British universities expressed deep concern about possible cuts in research funding, not least in science, owing partly to Brexit, which forced these institutions to leave EU research programs.
So, the UK’s tough choices accumulate, and the problems lurking around the corner look menacing.
Britain will have to make the best of Brexit.
But it will be a long, hard struggle, all the more so with an evasive fabulist in charge.

The Missing Link in Europe's AI Strategy
BRUSSELS – The European Commission’s strategy for artificial intelligence focuses on the need to establish “trust” and “excellence.”
Recently proposed AI regulation, the Commission argues, will create trust in this new technology by addressing its risks, while excellence will follow from EU member states investing and innovating.
With these two factors accounted for, Europe’s AI uptake supposedly will accelerate.
Unfortunately, protecting EU citizens’ fundamental rights, which should be the AI regulation’s core objective, appears to be a secondary consideration; and protections for workers’ rights don’t seem to have been considered at all.
AI is a flagship component of Europe’s digital agenda, and the Commission’s legislative package is fundamental to the proposed single market for data.
The draft regulation establishes rules concerning the introduction, implementation, and use of AI systems.
It adopts a risk-based approach, with unacceptable, high-risk, limited, and low-risk uses.
Under the proposal, AI systems deemed “high-risk” – posing significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons – are subject to an ex ante conformity assessment to be carried out by the provider, without prior validation by a competent external authority.
Requirements include high-quality data sets, sound data governance and management practices, extensive record-keeping, adequate risk management, detailed technical documentation, transparent user instructions, appropriate human oversight, explainable results, and a high level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.
The Commission says that its definition of AI, as well as the risk-based approach underpinning the draft regulation, are based on public consultation.
But the fact that industrial and tech firms constituted an overwhelming majority of the respondents to its 2020 AI White Paper suggests an exercise that is far from democratic.
These businesses, while pretending to promote knowledge, science, and technology, steered the regulatory process in a direction that serves their interests.
The voice of society, in particular trade unions, was drowned out.
The regulation has several shortcomings.
Among them are the Commission’s narrow risk-based approach, the absence of a redress mechanism, the failure to address the issue of liability for damage involving AI systems, and a reliance on regulatory sandboxes for providing “safe” environments in which to test new business models.
The draft also fails to deliver from a worker-protection perspective.
To address this shortcoming, an ad hoc directive that focuses on AI in the context of employment, which would protect workers (including those in the platform economy) and enable them to exercise their rights and freedoms on an individual or collective basis, would be a possible way forward.
Such a directive should address several key issues.
For starters, it should set employers’ responsibilities in preventing AI risks, in the same way that they are obliged to assess occupational health and safety hazards.
AI risks extend further, because they include possible abuses of managerial power stemming from the nature of the employment relationship, as well as other risks to workers’ privacy, fundamental rights, data protection, and overall health.
Safeguarding worker privacy and data protection is equally vital, because AI is hungry for data and workers are an important source of them.
The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a powerful tool that, in theory, applies to workers’ data in an employment context, including when these are used by an AI system.
But in practice, it is almost impossible for workers to exercise their GDPR rights vis-à-vis an employer.
The EU should introduce additional provisions to ensure they can.
Making the purpose of AI algorithms explainable is important, too.
Here, firms’ workplace transparency provisions will not protect workers.
Instead, employers, as users of algorithms, need to account for the possible harm their deployment can do in a workplace.
The use of biased values or variables can lead to the profiling of workers, target specific individuals, and categorize them according to their estimated “risk level.”
Another priority is ensuring that workers can exercise their “right to explanation.”
The implication, here, is that employers would be obliged to consult employees before implementing algorithms, rather than informing them after the fact.
Moreover, the information provided must enable workers to understand the consequences of an automated decision.
The new ad hoc directive should also guarantee that the “human-in-command” principle is respected in all human-machine interactions at work.
This involves giving humans the last word and explaining which data sources are responsible for final decisions when humans and machines act together.
Trade unions should be considered as part of the “human” component and play an active role alongside managers, IT support teams, and external consultants.
Furthermore, EU lawmakers must prohibit algorithmic worker surveillance.
Currently, worker monitoring is regulated by national laws that often predate GDPR and do not cover advanced, intrusive people analytics.
AI-powered tools such as biometrics, machine learning, semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and emotion-sensing technology can measure people’s biology, behavior, concentration, and emotions.
Such algorithmic surveillance does not passively scan workers but rather “scrapes” their personal lives, actively builds an image, and then makes decisions.
Lastly, workers need to be able to exercise agency by becoming AI-literate.
Teaching them technical digital skills so that they can operate a particular system is not enough.
Understanding AI’s role and its effect on their work environment requires workers to be informed, educated, and critically engaged with the technology.
Regulating AI systems, in particular those deemed high-risk, should not be based on their providers’ self-assessment.
Europe can become a global leader in the field, and foster genuine public trust in and acceptance of this emerging technology; but only if it effectively protects and involves its citizens and workers.
No “human-centric” AI will ever exist if workers and their representatives are unable to flag up the technology’s specific employment-related risks.
In that regard, the Commission’s draft regulation leaves much to be desired.
The European Parliament and EU member states must now act and, in particular, integrate worker protection in the final version of this key regulation.

Will China Confront a Revolution of Rising Expectations?
ZURICH – For over a decade, China has accounted for a quarter or more of global economic growth.
With its economy currently navigating a rough patch, the question is whether this impressive performance will persist.
Cassandras pointing to the possibility of a Chinese growth slowdown regularly invoke the specter of a middle-income trap.
Now that China is no longer poor, they warn, growth rates will fall, just as they have in all but a handful countries that have reached the same income level.
Growth is harder, they observe, when it can no longer be based on brute-force capital accumulation.
Now, it must be based on innovation, which is difficult to bring about in an economy that is still centrally directed.
Then there is the corporate sector’s heavy debt load.
A decline in earnings could render many of these debts unsustainable.
Whether the upshot is cascading defaults or a flurry of bailouts that shift the burden to the government, the result would weaken the country’s finances and sap investor confidence.
On top of this is the country’s aging population, which requires shifting investment from industrial capacity to social services.
This will imply slower growth insofar as productivity chronically lags in the service sector.
Finally, there is the possibility of a full-blown trade war with the United States.
We currently hear much talk of a “phase one” deal between the US and China.
But if we know one thing about US President Donald President Trump, it is that he is a “tariff man.”
Now facing an intensifying impeachment inquiry, he will seek to deflect attention.
Like any autocrat meeting resistance at home, he will marshal support by focusing on a foreign opponent.
This means that any “phase one” agreement will be at best temporary.
Missing from this line-up of usual suspects, however, is the most worrying scenario of all: popular unrest.
Skeptics contend that widespread protest against the regime and its policies is unlikely.
The Politburo continues to deliver improvements in living standards – and its security apparatus is formidable.
But consider events elsewhere.
In France, the Yellow Vests have been protesting most immediately against higher fuel prices but more broadly against a perceived lack of economic opportunity.
In Ecuador, anti-austerity protests reflect, more fundamentally, opposition to President Lenín Moreno’s government, which students, unions, and indigenous people criticize as out of touch with the public.
Protests in Chile were triggered by an increase in metro fares but have also focused on inequality, the education system, and pension problems.
Closest to home, of course, is Hong Kong, where political meddling by mainland China fueled protests that now target the city’s prohibitively high housing costs.
These movements are revolutions of rising expectations.
They are protests not so much over a deteriorating quality of life as over government’s failure to deliver everything that was promised.
Such protests are spontaneous, sparked by small matters, like a hike in fuel prices or metro fares.
But, because those small matters are indicative of the government’s disregard and even ignorance of popular concerns, they morph into larger movements.
These movements are leaderless, relying as they do on social media, which makes them hard to behead, but also causes them to evolve in unpredictable, even violent, ways.
Mainland Chinese are following developments in Hong Kong closely, at least insofar as state media and Internet censorship permit.
While some see events there as an affront to their national pride, others appear to be drawing different conclusions.
One recent study shows that those exposed to events in Hong Kong as a result of having visited during demonstrations are more likely to engage in online discussions of politically contentious issues.
And it is not as if Chinese people lack grievances.
They complain about regional inequality, especially if they live in the impoverished west.
If they farm on land abutting urban development, they are concerned about property rights.
Members of the “Ant Tribe” – recent university graduates who can’t find jobs matching their academic credentials and are reduced to living in subterranean hovels – are understandably concerned about social mobility.
On top of this are broader concerns about housing prices, especially in China’s first-tier cities.
Hong Kong has an extraordinarily high house-price-to-income ratio of 49.
But China, with a ratio of 30, is not far behind: it ranks fifth among 95 countries for which data are available.
People similarly have concerns about the quality of health care and other social services.
While China is moving rapidly up the global per capita income league tables, its ranking for infant mortality, at 122nd, remains shockingly low.
If unrest does, in fact, break out at some point in the future, foreign investors will be quick to withdraw.
As capital flees to safer havens, the authorities will have to tighten capital controls.
They will be forced to put their plans for financial opening and their dream of renminbi internationalization on hold.
Above all, unrest would cause GDP growth to suffer.
A weakened economy would leave more expectations unmet – and raise further questions about popular support for the regime.

Abusing Churchill
NEW YORK – A bronze bust of Winston Churchill, displayed in the White House since the 1960s, has been the object of a continuing right-wing canard in Washington.
The story goes that when President Barack Obama moved in, he returned the bust to the British Embassy, supposedly signifying his hatred of Britain.
In fact, Obama did no such thing.
The bust still stands in the White House Residence, where it always did, except for a short time under President George W. Bush when it was being repaired.
But Obama might have done well to remove the bust.
The cult of Churchill has not been an altogether beneficial one for the United States.
Too many US presidents fancy themselves Churchill’s true heirs.
Bush had a copy of Churchill’s bust, lent to him by Tony Blair, in the Oval Office.
He liked to portray himself as a “war president,” a “decider,” and a “great leader,” like Churchill.
He had a taste for battle dress.
And he got his country into a very foolish war.
Donald Trump’s British crony, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, suggested that Trump should put the bronze bust back in the Oval Office.
Trump thought this was a splendid idea.
Trump is the least appropriate figure to cast himself in Churchill’s mold.
Insofar as he has a coherent position on anything, he is hostile to most of the things that Churchill stood for.
His “America first” posture, standing aloof from Western allies, is exactly the kind of attitude against which Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt struggled in order to successfully resist Hitler’s Third Reich.
The summer before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 75 years ago this month, Churchill and Roosevelt met in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, to set out their ideals for a postwar world.
The resulting Atlantic Charter included everything Trump seems to be against: lower trade barriers, economic cooperation, and the advancement of social welfare.
Once Hitler was defeated, Churchill was also a proponent of European unification, even if he remained ambivalent about Britain’s role in the future union.
Farage’s campaign for Brexit, often pilfering Churchill’s own wartime rhetoric about Britain’s finest hour in defending freedom against tyranny, was aimed at dismantling the very project Churchill favored.
The “special relationship” between the US and Britain, established during WWII, was never as substantial as Churchill and others liked to believe.
The US, as the dominant postwar power, pursued its own interests, whether the British liked it or not.
And British pride in standing alone against Nazi Germany, and the self-aggrandizing notion of being America’s special partner, has prevented the United Kingdom from playing to its full strength as a major power inside the EU.
American leaders sometimes pay lip service to the special relationship, to flatter visiting British prime ministers or get the UK onside in dubious military adventures.
There is talk of giving the relationship a new lease of life in the age of Trump and Brexit.
Whereas Obama warned that Britain outside the EU would be at the back of the queue for special trade deals, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan recently stated that the US should quickly make a new deal with Britain to show “solidarity” with an “indispensable ally.”
A special US tenderness for Brexit Britain – Trump oddly referred to himself as “Mr. Brexit” – rather suggests the solidarity of two countries embarking on their own forms of economic nationalism.
Again, this is precisely the route that Churchill and Roosevelt sought to avoid; after all, economic nationalism was one of the reasons why Europeans almost succeeded in destroying their continent.
Of course, Trump’s love of Brexit may be just a question of words, like so much else about the great showman.
It is hard to imagine the US jeopardizing its economic interests by favoring Britain at the expense of far bigger stakes in the rest of Europe.
But words do matter, as Churchill knew well.
Again, the rhetoric of Trump and his supporters, and of the Brexiteers, could not be further removed from the spirit of the Atlantic Charter.
Talk of sinister international bankers and other “citizens of nowhere” (British Prime Minister Theresa May’s phrase) undermining, in league with rootless liberal elites, “ordinary,” “real,” and “decent” people (Farage) smacks of the anti-Semitic propaganda that swirled around Europe in the 1930s.
And Churchill’s response to the flirtations of Trump and the European far right with Vladimir Putin’s Russia can easily be imagined.
None of this means that Churchill was always right, let alone a figure to emulate.
He was the right man in 1940 to raise British morale, when morale was about the only thing the British had going for them.
But he is not a good model for politicians in less perilous times.
His views of colonial rule were already out of date before the war, and became a racist anachronism after it.
His romantic ideas about the moral superiority of the English-speaking peoples were old-fashioned during his lifetime, and are an arrogant absurdity now.
But Churchill was neither petty nor provincial.
His vision, at least as far as the Western world is concerned, may have been romantic, but it had a certain nobility.
The same cannot be said of the next occupant of the White House.
The idea of Trump, advised by Farage, using Churchill’s bronze head as a totem would have filled the old man with horror.

Equality or Estrangement
TOKYO – Those whom the gods would destroy, they grant their wishes.
Will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan?
For a half-century, the US, which wrote Japan’s postwar “peace” constitution, has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability.
But now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees, the US is getting nervous, with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “unpredictable.”
These strains in the US-Japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of Asian stability – first became noticeable in December, when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which houses the “souls” of (among others) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War.
The US has always criticized Japanese officials’ visits to the shrine, but through diplomatic channels.
This time, America voiced its displeasure openly.
The US is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on Japan’s relations with its neighbors, particularly China and South Korea.
But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe’s government who question Obama’s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America’s defense commitment.
Such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone, which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory.
The US tried to have it both ways: though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China’s move, it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities.
Likewise, US acquiescence in China’s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal (a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea) raised questions in Japan about the two countries’ supposed harmony of interests.
In fact, although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan, successive American presidents have been vague about the details.
Ultimately, the idea always seemed to be that Japan would pay more for defense, but the US would set the partnership’s objectives.
Abe’s conception of the US-Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality.
After all, a society like Japan, trying to escape two decades of economic malaise, cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy, even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US.
Far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism, Abe’s national-security strategy reflects, above all, a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese.
His bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape.
Strangely, it is all but forgotten – particularly by the Chinese – that for two decades Japan has watched China’s rise quietly from the sidelines (even supportively, to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy).
Indeed, Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self-confidence – a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago.
But the fact remains that one of Abe’s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan’s long economic stagnation.
Those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern: economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure Japan’s position as a leading Asian power.
The US, however, regards Abe’s worries about Japan’s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific.
For example, the US views the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it, Japan, and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade.
But, for Abe, the TPP’s value for Japan’s sense of identity – that it is now a more outward-looking nation – is just as important.
In Abe’s view, Japan needs to regain, wherever possible, the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by China.
This does not mean that Abe’s Japan will become an ally like France under Jacques Chirac, spurning US leadership for the sake of it; instead, Abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the US that reflects the alliance's voluntary nature.
He believes that, given the new balance of power in Asia, the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice, and the wherewithal, to act autonomously or with regional allies.
Fortunately, Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different.
Both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach.
And both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place.
But even here, there is a difference.
The US, convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy, believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power, a structure of peace will follow naturally.
Abe, by contrast, believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon, and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance.
Although Abe has lifted Japan’s sights and self-confidence, he recognizes that Japan faces real limits.
The US, too, should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally.
Some wishes really are better left unfulfilled.

The Humanities Crisis
NEW YORK – A striking symmetry is emerging in debates about the future of higher education around the world.
On the one hand, there is growing concern that the United States and many European countries are failing to prepare enough university graduates in the fields driving the twenty-first century “knowledge economy,” such as engineering and information technology.
This fear has led to the narrowing of the concept of education to mean the acquisition of practical skills.
On the other hand, the worry in some parts of Asia is that young people entering the work force with strong technical training lack sufficient experience “thinking outside the box.”
This fear is manifesting itself in an incipient effort to expand education to include the cultivation of feeling and imagination.
Both movements are rooted in economic concerns.
In the US, where most undergraduates bear at least part of the cost of their university education, political pressure is mounting to provide incentives like tuition discounts or loan forgiveness to students of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (the so-called STEM fields).
Cost-cutting measures, such as compressing traditional four-year degree programs into three years – thereby reducing or eliminating elective courses in “impractical” subjects like literature, philosophy, and fine arts – are also being discussed.
Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China, there are calls for extending university programs so that students can obtain a broad, liberal education, in the hope that graduates will be more inclined to experiment and innovate.
Hong Kong University, for example, has extended its undergraduate programs from three years to four.
But such a narrow, economics-based view fails to account for the larger questions of value that societies worldwide are facing.
To be sure, progress in any field, from commerce and communications to health and environmental science, will become increasingly dependent on technological innovation, and thus on the high-order skills – acquired through intensive technical training – that drive it.
It is also true, however, that such training does not provide an adequate foundation for addressing the more abstract, but profoundly important, questions that ultimately must guide global policy and decision-making.
For example:
· How can the imperative of economic development be reconciled with the need to limit climate change?
· What does national sovereignty mean in a world where diseases, pollutants, and terrorists cross national borders at will?
· Are there universal human rights that transcend conflicting claims of particular cultural traditions?
· How should limited resources be distributed in order to provide opportunity and hope to young people, while treating the elderly with dignity and respect?
· What are a country’s obligations to refugees fleeing from persecution, poverty, or strife elsewhere?
· How should we balance individual liberty and collective security?
In answering such questions, advances in science and technology (for example, new methods of energy production, surveillance, or online learning) will have a key role to play.
But moral and ethical questions never yield fully to technical solutions; they also require an understanding of humanity’s social and cultural heritage.
Science can help us to attain the life we want, but it cannot teach us what kind of life is worth wanting.
In short, each side in the current education debate is half right.
As human affairs become increasingly complex and morally exigent, future generations will need both scientific and humanistic learning – and they will need them more than ever.
Fortunately, promising new models for making education more coherent and capacious are emerging.
Yale University and the National University of Singapore have worked together to establish Yale-NUS, Singapore’s first liberal arts college.
Led by a literary scholar and an astronomer, this new residential college aims to break down interdisciplinary boundaries and enable students to learn from one another.
Likewise, Quest University in Canada encourages students to bring both scientific and humanistic knowledge to bear on today’s most pressing problems.
Similar efforts have been underway for years in the US.
For example, North Carolina State University’s Benjamin Franklin Scholars program – a collaboration between the College of Engineering and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences – aims “to produce well-rounded professionals who are analytical problem-solvers, ethical decision-makers, and effective communicators.”
Unfortunately, such programs largely lack the visibility and influence needed to shape educational reform.
It is time to abandon the “either/or” discourse that pits science against humanities – which the British chemist and novelist C.P. Snow identified more than a half-century ago as an obstacle to human progress.
It is time to seek out best practices that bridge this putative divide, and scale them up.
In the important work of adapting educational institutions for the future, we must not lose sight of their core mission as articulated in the past.
No one has expressed that mission better than Benjamin Franklin, a man of letters and a scientific innovator, who defined education as the quest for “true merit.”
“True merit,” Franklin wrote, consists in “an inclination joined with an ability to serve mankind, one’s country, friends, and family; which ability is…to be acquired or greatly increased by true learning; and should, indeed, be the great aim and end of all learning.”
This is an aspiration that should be renewed for every generation.

Money for Nothing
MUNICH – A monetary-policy regime centered on quantitative easing (QE) and zero or even negative interest rates has created an extraordinarily permissive environment for politicians of a certain disposition.
Those who are willing to exploit current conditions to boost their own popularity can expect clear sailing ahead – at least for now.
Throughout almost all of the advanced economies, monetary and fiscal policymaking are interacting in a new and unique way.
Consider, for example, that the German government just issued 30-year bonds with a negative yield. That means it can borrow for free, and, in theory, do anything it wants – at no cost.
And Germany is hardly alone, which is why it is not surprising to hear a growing chorus of voices calling for greater fiscal activism at the first sign of a growth slowdown.
Obviously, the current situation could have far-reaching monetary and distributive consequences, given that governments are gradually expropriating from the traditional rentiers. But that is just the start.
Politics itself has always been about managing tradeoffs. Money spent in one area cannot be spent somewhere else.
If nurses and doctors are paid more, teachers, police, or firefighters will be paid relatively less.
Governments must choose between cutting taxes and building new high-speed rail links, aircraft carriers, or roads and bridges.
But now, unconventional monetary policy has given rise to an unconventional politics.
In Europe, populist governments in Central and Eastern Europe have been especially good at playing the new game.
They can buy off different political factions, raise child benefits, increase pensions, reduce the retirement age, build infrastructure, and cut taxes all at the same time.
If the opposition pushes new spending proposals, the government can simply adopt those ideas as its own, ensuring its hold on power.
This new blurring of monetary economics and fiscal policy will inevitably lead to dysfunction.
In the 1990s, when Europeans were considering whether to adopt the euro, the single currency was sold both as a disciplining instrument and as a means of sugarcoating the bitter tradeoffs of conventional politics.
Joining the eurozone meant sacrificing some degree of sovereignty over fiscal policy; but membership would bring lower interest rates, thereby reducing the costs of government debt and freeing up resources for other uses.
Under the new dispensation, the increased temptation to spend is still there.
But it comes with a new, peculiar limitation: the sugar fairy only sprinkles her magic dust on countries that pledge to remain within the circle.
The moment the prospect of leaving is raised, the spell is broken, which is why even Euroskeptic politicians in Italy and France no longer entertain that option.
Of course, the euro does not magically turn member-state governments into models of economic rectitude.
On the contrary, they are now effectively rewarded for acting irresponsibly and unpredictably, while forcing monetary authorities into a more accommodating position.
The most obvious example of this gambit is in the United States, where President Donald Trump’s trade war and Twitter threats are fueling economic uncertainty and putting wind in the sails of doves on the Federal Open Market Committee.
The Fed is now cutting interest rates to head off a growth slowdown.
It is only a matter of time before European populists – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and Matteo Salvini (whose ambition remains to become the Italian prime minister) double down on the same strategy.
Compounding the dysfunction, populists have latched onto new intellectual arguments, and are increasingly presenting themselves as serious, innovative thinkers.
Their first task is to persuade voters that what they are doing is not dangerous. But this hasn’t been too difficult, given that voices celebrating the demise of the old liberal order are now heard across the political spectrum.
Throughout the advanced economies, there is a widespread perception that since the 2008 financial crisis, the old rules have no longer applied.
The new narrative that has emerged is ideal for populists.
It holds that the financial crisis discredited traditional economics, and that “neoliberalism” was a dangerous illusion.
The neoliberal insight that came in for the greatest criticism after the crisis was that fiscal restraint is a virtue and rewards adherents with lower interest rates, cheaper credit, and enhanced consumer spending.
According to the critics, government spending is not only free, but also an unalloyed good.
In this brave new economy, no one seems to be able to say authoritatively how much debt is dangerous.
But that doesn’t mean there isn’t some level of debt that could trigger a dramatic reversal.
If depositors and investors become nervous, debt could become expensive again, making the existing debt stock unsustainable.
Only then will the populist magic stop working.
Those who want to restore conventional politics and the old rules find themselves in an unenviable position.
Although they do not wish for an end to prosperity, they sound like they do when standing next to populists.
Nobody wants to vote for Cassandra when Pollyanna is on the ballot. By the time Cassandra’s warnings are borne out, it is always already too late.

Central Asia’s Diverse COVID-19 Responses
BISHKEK – COVID-19’s impact on my country, Kyrgyzstan, first hit home for me on March 19, when my son arrived at Bishkek’s international airport from a “highly infected” European country.
I was unable to see him because, along with several dozen others who arrived on the flight with him, he was immediately subjected to a 14-day quarantine at a former American military base that the United States donated to the country in 2014.
But it was a quarantine in name only.
The former base was chaotic and disorganized.
Instead of being strictly isolated from one another, arriving passengers were confined to a completely unprepared and tightly fenced area, where they moved and interacted freely.
Moreover, hygiene was practically non-existent, with few toilets, washbasins, or showers for more than a hundred people.
So, this attempt to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country was in fact creating ideal conditions for infection to spread among new arrivals.
Five days later, and without any explanation, all of the isolated passengers were released into “home quarantine.”
I heard later that at least one of them had tested positive for COVID-19, but even today, nobody knows whether the passengers have infected anyone else.
This and numerous other episodes demonstrate how completely unprepared Kyrgyzstan and, it seems, our Central Asian neighbors were for the virus.
The government has tacitly admitted as much.
A few days after the quarantined passengers were released, the country’s chief sanitary officer left his post.
And on April 1, both the deputy prime minister and the health minister were fired.
This muddled response to the COVID-19 threat seems incongruous, because the Kyrgyz authorities had initially taken appropriate, timely decisions.
On January 27, the State Security Council recommended that the government “prevent the entry of coronavirus infection into the country.”
But, despite acknowledging the problem a month and a half before Kyrgyzstan reported its first case of COVID-19, the authorities then did virtually nothing.
For example, the government was well aware that many Kyrgyz citizens were making the obligatory Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca earlier this year.
They returned to Kyrgyzstan on March 12, and some of them subsequently were among the first citizens to be diagnosed with COVID-19.
And yet the government seemed paralyzed.
It failed to purchase enough reagents, testing kits, protective suits, and other necessary equipment, and did not prepare observation and quarantine facilities.
The returnees from Mecca were not tested until March 18, by which time they could have infected others.
And following the positive tests, the Kyrgyz authorities did not carry out any contact tracing.
Kyrgyzstan was not alone among Central Asian countries in its relatively slow response to the pandemic.
Kazakhstan reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 13 and Uzbekistan two days later.
And after weeks of denials, Tajikistan finally confirmed its first case only on April 30, perhaps not coincidentally just a few hours before the arrival of a World Health Organization mission in the country.
Turkmenistan remains the only Central Asian country, and one of the very few in the world, that has reported no COVID-19 cases to date (its government recently declined to invite a WHO mission to visit the country).
As of May 19, the other four Central Asian countries had reported a relatively modest combined total of 12,525 cases, or about 169 per million inhabitants, and in total a quite modest 106 deaths.
The numbers from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan can perhaps be trusted.
These countries’ governments provide a few updates about the pandemic each day, while the situation is actively discussed in independent media (including foreign outlets) and on social-media platforms.
Non-governmental organizations also have a critical monitoring role to play, which is why the Kyrgyz government’s ongoing attempts to restrict these groups’ activities are particularly worrying.
The Turkmen and Tajik authorities are traditionally less open with the media.
But Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which has sources in both countries, recently reported that the Turkmen authorities had transferred more than 400 people from a quarantine zone in Turkmenabad, the country’s second-largest city, to small provincial hospitals.
This followed other media reports alleging that the authorities were trying to hide coronavirus cases from the WHO.
But the situation in Tajikistan is currently causing the greatest concern, with the World Bank recently warning of up to 230,500 severe COVID-19 infections and as many as 21,000 deaths (the country’s population is about 9.3 million).
The Tajik authorities are apparently beginning to recognize the danger.
On May 1, the Asia-Plus news agency reported that Rustam Emomali, the mayor of the capital, Dushanbe, had addressed residents and urged them not to panic, assuring them that the state had enough resources to combat the pandemic.
Finally, COVID-19 has also created a serious problem for the estimated 4-5 million Central Asian migrants who live and work in Russia.
Most of them are from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, and are a major source of remittances.
Indeed, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan received remittances totaling about 30% of their GDP in 2019, and are among the world leaders in remittances per capita.
But many of these migrants have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, and border closures are preventing them from returning home.
Although the Russian government’s decision to pay the migrants unemployment benefits will help, this is only a temporary solution.
Their incomes and remittances will fall sharply, which will dramatically affect Central Asian economies.
Having recognized the COVID-19 threat early on, some of Central Asia’s governments were slow to prepare for the coronavirus’s eventual arrival.
And with the pandemic’s biggest, mainly economic challenges still to come to the region, the real problems may lie ahead.

The Dilemma of Central Banking
BEIJING – Low interest rates – both nominal and real – have been a persistent feature of advanced economies since the 1980s.
How long, many now wonder, can the trend last?
In 2015, the “Geneva Report” on the topic by the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies and the Center for Economic Policy Research argued that interest rates would stay low for long, but most likely not indefinitely.
But with more than $13 trillion worth of negative-yielding bonds outstanding in the world economy, many more scholars and investors have started to think that rates could stay low forever.
If so, central bankers will face a critical dilemma: in the event of a growth slowdown, should they keep their limited powder dry, or use it preemptively?
The answer lies outside monetary policy and beyond national borders.
To see why, it is useful to revisit the basic concept of interest, which has always been a source of controversy in economic theory.
As the Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk pointed out in his 1890 book, Capital and Interest, “the theory [of interest] exhibits a motley collection of the most conflicting opinions, no one of them strong enough to conquer, and no one of them willing to admit defeat.” The situation today is not much different.
Explanations for the current era of low interest rates come from either of two seemingly contradictory schools of thoughts: neoclassical theory and Keynesian theory.
Neoclassical thinkers in the tradition of Alfred Marshall, Knut Wicksell, and Irving Fisher believe that real interest rates are determined by real economic forces.
Money (or monetary policy) is neutral, and the rate of interest is that which equilibrates saving and investment, as determined by time preference and returns, respectively.
(Hence, the title of Fisher’s 1930 book on the topic is: The Theory of Interest, as Determined by Impatience to Spend Income and Opportunity to Invest It.)
Using the neoclassical framework, one can identify a range of structural factors – from demographic changes driving up savings to slower technological progress reducing demand – to explain the secular decline in interest rates.
By contrast, according to John Maynard Keynes’s “Liquidity Preference Theory,” interest is best understood as a reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period of time.
As such, it is not about saving in general, but about the saving of money in particular.
The interest rate, then, is determined jointly by the supply of liquidity and economic agents’ preference for money.
In normal times, these two schools of thought run in parallel and can coexist.
Keynes focused on the nominal rate, while Fisher focused on the real rate; Keynes emphasized the short term, and Fisher the long run. Keynes’s principle of monetary non-neutrality in the short run does not directly conflict with Fisher’s principle of neutrality in the long run.
Usually, when central banks act in a Keynesian manner by cutting nominal rates, real rates will fall, owing to the sticky-price effect.
Yet, with interest rates now stuck near or at the zero-lower bound (ZLB), these two views might collide: a nominal-rate cut will elicit an immediate one-for-one reduction in inflation expectations, leaving the real rate unchanged.
Some economists refer to this change in expectations as the “neo-Fisherian effect,” because the traditional Fisher effect – whereby inflation tracks the nominal rate by a factor of one to one – is supposed to happen only in the long run.
A Fisherian effect will not happen if inflation expectations remain well anchored.
But once rates are trapped at or near the ZLB, inflation expectations begin to fall; the usual Keynesian effect comes to be dominated by the neo-Fisherian effect.
Hence, a distinct feature of the ZLB is that it is where Fisher crowds out Keynes.
Central banks can cut nominal rates to zero or into negative territory all they want, but real rates will remain unchanged.
The more Keynesian a central bank acts (by trying to stimulate demand through rate cuts), the more Fisherian the economy becomes, at least in terms of inflation expectations.
And when this happens, monetary policy becomes not just impotent but potentially harmful.
To be sure, the neo-Fisherian perspective is controversial in academic circles.
But even if there is no perverse Fisherian effect, interest-rate pegging or a situation in which rates are involuntary trapped at the ZLB could still amplify shocks.
For central banks, avoiding these conditions can pose a dilemma.
Should they cut rates when necessary, even if doing so might bring on a Fisherian trap?
An overdose of monetary policy may create conditions of monetary “non-neutrality” by pushing down the equilibrium real rate.
This can happen through at least two channels.
The first is the financial boom-bust cycle.
Persistently low interest rates encourage risk-seeking, and can result in financial imbalances and debt build-ups.
When the music stops, central banks must reduce rates even further to counter the inevitable bust.
The second channel is resource misallocation, which can happen when too much liquidity inhibits Schumpeterian “creative destruction” by offering a lifeline to uncompetitive firms.
Resolving the dilemma will require a fundamental change in the design and implementation of economic policy. We need far better policy coordination at the national and international levels.
At the country level, monetary policy cannot be the “only game in town.”
Not only should fiscal policy and structural reforms play a larger role, but macroprudential policy should be made a top priority, in order to contain financial boom-bust cycles.
At the international level, a well-integrated financial safety net would help reduce the need for self-insurance through safe assets.
One good way to pool resources would be to enhance the International Monetary Fund’s firepower through quota reforms.
A new and improved international monetary system won’t be built in a day, but we have to start somewhere.

Engineering a More Responsible Digital Future
ZURICH – The world is being battered by technological disruption, as innovations such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual reality change how societies and economies work.
Individually, each of these technologies has the potential to transform established products, services, and associated support networks.
Taken together, they will upend old business models and institutions, heralding a new era of economic, social, and political history.
How will we respond?
Major economic transformations typically produce far-reaching change.
During the first Industrial Revolution, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, new manufacturing processes eventually led to huge improvements in human wellbeing.
As productivity increased, salaries and living standards rose.
But, early in the process, mechanization brought negative consequences, like unemployment, child labor, and environmental degradation.
The social and political impact of the digital revolution could be even more dramatic.
Wars and revolutions may erupt, and values like human rights and civil liberties could be undermined.
As my colleagues and I noted in a recent article in Scientific American, the more computers know about us, “the less likely our choices are to be free and not predetermined by others” – as long as informational self-determination is impossible.
Fortunately, the loss of individual autonomy is not inevitable.
It is possible to engineer a more responsible digital future.
But we must start doing so immediately.
Success requires public discourse, digital enlightenment and emancipation, and broader awareness of technology’s risks.
In other words, the transition we are facing is bigger than any one country or organization can manage alone.
We all have something at stake: our future.
There are obvious dangers in letting technological progress alone drive this change.
In 2008, Wired editor Chris Anderson suggested that big data would eventually reveal all truth, without requiring science or theory.
Clearly, that hasn’t happened.
With more data at their disposal, scientists find more patterns to study; it takes science to judge which are meaningful and which are misleading.
The expectation that AI would overcome human weaknesses such as bias has also fallen short.
Today, many AI systems discriminate against people, and can even be manipulated.
Other predictions of the new “digital society” were equally off-base.
So-called smart cities – in which urban life is automated – have so far failed to live up to expectations.
That’s because cities are not simply giant supply chains; they are also spaces for experimentation, creativity, innovation, learning, and interaction.
Finally, while the “platform economy,” and its reliance on the Internet, computation, and data, has given rise to some of the most valuable companies in the world, it has also turned many citizens into passive consumers.
The irony of hyper-connectivity is that people are less discerning not only about the products they buy, but also with the information they consume.
It is, after all, this “attention economy” that spawned “fake news.”
Simply put, our digital utopia will not arrive unaided.
We need a more ethical approach to engineering technology, one that integrates constitutional, cultural, and moral norms and values into artificial and autonomous systems.
An “ethically aligned,” “value-sensitive” design approach is needed in every aspect of technological development – from smart devices to the software that supports our governments and markets.
For example, if democracy is to remain a viable political model, the information systems that democratic governments use must be designed to support human rights, dignity, self-determination, pluralism, division of responsibility, transparency, fairness, and justice.
To achieve this democratic digital future, the world needs to change how it thinks about technology.
We need to build open, participatory information ecosystems that empower anyone in the global economy to contribute ideas, talent, and resources.
In a networked world, where everything we do affects others, we must learn to think beyond ourselves, and pursue cooperation, co-creation, co-evolution, and collective intelligence.
If we progress accordingly, the Fourth Industrial Revolution can be more inclusive than the first; that is the future that my colleagues and I are working toward.
For example, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, we are engineering socially responsible communication networks and urban governance systems, while the FuturICT initiative, an international network of researchers, is applying a multidisciplinary approach to technology development.
The goal of both research efforts is to facilitate a more equitable digital future.
We have the ability to engineer technology that serves us, rather than enslaves us.
But building that future demands a new digital zeitgeist, whereby social, cultural, environmental, and ethical values become part of the design process.
Innovations and revolutions are often upsetting and tumultuous, but in the digital age, they can also be responsible.

Bush’s Gambling Debts
George W. Bush’s economic policies have been based on an extraordinarily reckless gamble that reflects a political coalition of two major forces: the super-rich and evangelical Christians.
As those policies fail, global financial markets are reacting negatively, adding uncertainty to the world economy, and there is little relief in sight, because America is entering a period of prolonged political infighting and stalemate.
The super-rich had one over-riding objective in joining the Bush coalition: tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest households.
Evangelicals were brought in on the basis of so-called “family values,” meaning opposition to abortion and gay marriage, and promises of active government support for religious activities, including direct payments to religious groups for social services that they provide locally and internationally.
The Bush team believed that they would eventually balance the tax cuts for the rich with reductions in government spending, but they never explained this to the public.
Instead, for four years they pretended that budget deficits were of little concern.
Only after being re-elected did they begin to explain that large budget deficits, caused mainly by lower tax revenues, would require sharp cuts in social security, health care spending, and other areas.
But the majority of Americans, having supported the tax cuts in Bush’s first term because it gave them a little extra cash, do not support the attack on basic government services that has followed.
This opposition extends to Christian evangelicals voters, who tend to live in working-class and middle-class households that depend on many kinds of government social services.
Despite the avowedly “free-market” beliefs of many Christian fundamentalists, as voters they support government-financed pensions, health care, and other public services.
Bush’s tax cutting was irresponsible from the start, but became much more so after September 11, 2001.
The Bush administration raised military spending sharply as it went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, and as it increased spending on national security at home, without ever explaining to the American people how this would be financed.
The military-plus-security budget soared by more than 2% of GNP, while tax revenues fell by much more.
At the same time, Bush supported expenditure increases for popular items like education and prescription drug benefits, but paid for these services by borrowing the money rather than ensuring sufficient tax revenues.
No sooner did this strategy pay off with a narrow re-election victory – one that strengthened Republican control of Congress – than the dark realities of Bush’s fiscal recklessness started to be recognized.
The annual US budget deficit reached 5% of GNP, with an enormous part of the gap financed each year by Asian central banks, which now hold about $2 trillion in claims against America.
The problem is that Bush’s reckless gamble has now built up considerable political momentum.
As soon as he was re-elected, Bush started to propose cuts in popular government programs, but his own party is rejecting those cuts.
With the Republican-controlled Congress seeking to make the tax cuts for the rich permanent, the world is beginning to realize that America’s budget deficits are now entrenched, with no end in sight.
Because America’s economy is so large, and the dollar so central to global finance, chronic US budget deficits mean huge global repercussions.
The dollar is weakening, as financial markets understand that the US will need to borrow huge sums from abroad for years to come.
More ominously, the willingness of foreign central banks to lend to the US also looks likely to end.
After all, why should the central banks of China, Japan, South Korea, and other Asian countries accumulate vast holdings of US Treasury bills if the dollar is likely to lose value in the years ahead?
In a bizarre, but not unexpected way, America is lashing out at others for its problems.
Huge tax cuts and rising military spending have fueled an enormous rise in imports, and therefore a yawning trade deficit now accompanies America’s weak fiscal position.
But US politicians are blaming China and other countries for “unfair trade,” even threatening them with sanctions.
This response to homegrown problems plays well with voters, but it is ridiculous and ignorant, especially since the US has been depending on China to help finance the fiscal deficits.
In essence, the US is lashing out at its own banker, even as it asks the banker for yet more loans!
When Bush asked for spending cuts at the beginning of the year – including a social security reform that includes cuts in future benefits – world financiers expected that Bush would get his way, or most of it.
Little did they appreciate that American voters, having never actually supported spending cuts, would resist.
As that reality sinks in, economic prospects darken.
Foreigners will become less enthusiastic about continued lending to the US, weakening the dollar further, forcing up US interest rates, and threatening to undermine America’s stock market and consumer spending.
But as the storm clouds gather in the coming year, the political coalition that put Bush in power will stifle progress in undoing the fiscal mess.
Bush’s gamble was a loser from the start, generating costly results – mainly for the US, but for the rest of the world, too – for years to come.

Navigating the Energy Revolution
RIYADH/LONDON – For decades, the international energy landscape has been relatively stable, with producers like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Algeria selling oil and gas to consumers in the United States and Europe.
In a few years, however, the energy terrain is likely to be unrecognizable, as dramatic technological, economic, and geopolitical changes reshape commercial relationships worldwide.
What is needed is a new governance structure, one that moves beyond traditional bilateral relationships between producers and consumers.
In a rapidly evolving world, guaranteeing energy security will require the careful management of multiple, interlocking relationships.
Only an inclusive international forum, in which complex ideas can be shared and debated, is likely to prove adequate to the task of navigating the new era of energy use, production, and consumption.
The ongoing changes are profound.
In many energy-exporting countries, domestic consumption is rising steeply.
Historically, these countries have treated energy as a cheap resource.
Today, they are increasingly taking steps to remove subsidies, introduce market prices, and increase efficiency – policies that are more typically associated with energy-importing countries.
BP predicts that in the Middle East, with its extensive fossil-fuel reserves, primary energy consumption will grow 77% by 2035.
At the same time, some traditional importers are tapping new sources of energy and becoming producers, changing the direction of energy flows.
The shale-energy revolution in the US is perhaps the best-known example of this shift, but it is not the only one.
The rapidly growing renewable-energy industry is another factor disrupting traditional relationships between producers and consumers.
In the first half of 2014, 13% of electricity in Germany came from wind energy alone.
Denmark, a country that in the 1970s was almost entirely dependent on energy imports, is now the European Union’s only net energy exporter, often generating more than 100% of its electricity needs from wind power.
Meanwhile, advances in energy efficiency are also reducing demand for traditional producers’ exports.
Highly efficient buildings often can be easily heated with locally produced renewable electricity and supplied with hot water from solar collectors.
The introduction of the Near Zero Energy Buildings standard for new buildings in the EU is set to reduce drastically dependence on gas for heating.
The risk is that these rapid changes will combine with destabilizing geopolitics to trigger a retreat from global energy markets.
If countries began to define energy security as energy independence and try to supply all their own needs, the result could be expensive overcapacity, massive price distortions, slower technological progress, and weaker economic growth.
With the need to maintain trust in the competitive, politically charged, and often unpredictable energy sector both greater than ever and more difficult than ever to meet, an international forum dedicated to addressing concerns and easing tensions could be a powerful tool.
But it must have the right focus.
For example, it should not aim at producing legally binding decisions.
Plenty of bodies, such as the World Trade Organization, the Energy Charter, and the Energy Community, already do an excellent job of developing rules or enforcing compliance in the energy sector.
Moreover, though such a body should be inclusive, it need not have global ambitions; it would be impractical to try to bring everybody to the table.
And while its founders should take care that it not be led or dominated by a single country or bloc of countries, there is no harm if it starts small, with only a few countries, before beginning to expand.
Indeed, the European Commission, which is working toward creating an energy union, is well placed to initiate an open dialogue with non-EU countries on long-term energy policies.
The EU is the largest energy importer in the world, and it would be well served to join the discussion of its energy strategy to a conversation with the world’s main exporters.
As the EU revises both its energy and foreign affairs policies, it should not miss the chance to integrate an open energy policy dialogue into its planning.
In this context, one of the commission’s traditional weaknesses – that foreign and energy policies are usually decided by individual member states – could serve as an important advantage.
The commission will be seen as a facilitator of the discussion, rather than a leader or a dominant player.
Given a proper forum for ironing out disagreements, the rapidly changing energy landscape could be a source of new prosperity.
The alternative is a world at risk of tensions and misunderstandings – ones that could easily jump out of the realm of energy policy into international relations and security.

Education Cannot Wait
LONDON – “Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to him.”
These words, spoken by Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, should be taken as a test of our sincerity, and as a challenge to our complacency, when considering the fate of the 30 million children displaced from their homes by civil wars and natural disasters.
More boys and girls have been uprooted by crisis than at any time since 1945.
They are likely to spend their school-age years without entering a classroom, their talents undeveloped and their potential unlocked.
There are now 75 million young people whose education has been interrupted by conflict and crisis.
Yet urgency – and international law, which mandates the education of all displaced children – fails to inspire action.
Displaced children are more likely to become the youngest laborers in the factory, the youngest brides at the altar, and the youngest soldiers in the trench.
Without opportunity, children are vulnerable to extremists and radicalization.
Every year, close to a half-million girls are trafficked and vanish.
The fate of these dispossessed is tethered to the thinnest of lifelines.
When disaster strikes, what can only be described as a begging bowl is handed around the world’s donor community.
Voluntary contributions are then administered by refugee agencies, charities, and NGOs, which heroically help refugees scrape by with the bare essentials – food, water, shelter, and protection.
In such circumstances, the right to education becomes an unaffordable “luxury.”
While UN Peacekeepers are funded by assessed contributions levied on member countries, the millions of children displaced by crises have no guarantee that anyone will fund their schooling.
Indeed, less than 2% of humanitarian aid reaches education.
Syria’s civil war, now entering its sixth year, and the first anniversary of Nepal’s devastating earthquake – two disasters that have forced millions more children into the streets – serve as painful reminders that we lack the means to return children to the classroom in the wake of such tragedies.
A permanent fund securing education for children in emergency situations is long overdue.
Instead of wasting months begging for aid, such a reserve fund would be capable of delivering it immediately.
At the onset of an emergency, the fund would swiftly assess where dispossessed children are, develop a strategy, and put in place a plan to provide education for them.
Now, for the first time, we are in a position to deliver on this promise.
Under the leadership of UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, Chair of the Global Partnership for Education Julia Gillard, and World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim – and with the support of the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon – an unprecedented humanitarian fund for education in emergencies is about to be established.
The new “Education Cannot Wait” fund will respond to new realities and requirements.
Most child refugees are likely to spend more than a decade out of their own countries, so their plight cannot be considered temporary.
The breakthrough fund will support the education of refugees for up to five years, instead of the mere months of patchwork provisions that are presently on offer.
No longer will humanitarian, security, and development needs be split into silos with their own addresses and agendas.
A single fund will now meet these needs at once.
After all, when refugee children find a place in school, they are more secure, their parents are more hopeful, and their states are more stable.
The fund will not be bound by old World Bank rules that, until recently, excluded the education of refugee children in middle-income countries from concessional loans.
The initiative will be the first official humanitarian fund for education.
And a parallel UN-led fund will have distinct windows through which businesses, foundations, and individuals can contribute.
To be sure, delivering an education to displaced children demands a departure from pure voluntarism: a shift toward assessed contributions collected by levies from wealthy countries.
But, until this shift occurs, we will ask individual philanthropists, corporations and charities – as well as new and old aid donors – to come together to catalyze the venture.
Our sense of urgency, coupled with the requisite funds, promises to have a significant impact.
When it comes to securing schooling, no price tag is too steep.
The fund will harness today’s passions and key innovations.
We want technology firms to play a central role in providing new ideas and disruptive thinking.
We want firms that already offer refugees an online education, internet access and IT hardware to drive the provision of education to displaced and isolated girls and boys.
In establishing this fund, we are ending the era of the formulaic crisis response.
It was Gandhi’s belief that reflection could motivate action by recalibrating our moral compass.
What makes this fund unique is not the series of new benchmarks it sets.
Rather, it signals a change in how we meet the challenges of an emergency.
Going beyond present demands, the fund is based on the needs of the future.
In providing resources to deliver education, the fund is a bold affirmation of a better tomorrow – an unwavering promise to unlock talent, develop potential, and secure futures for all children, wherever they are.
By establishing “Education Cannot Wait”, we are sending a message to the downcast and dispossessed everywhere.
Education, at its best, offers something that food, shelter, and healthcare can never themselves provide: hope, the chance to plan, and to prepare for the future.

The Fiscal Cliff and US Foreign Policy
PRINCETON – The world should be worried.
The possibility that US President Barack Obama and the Republicans in Congress will fail to reach a compromise before mandatory deep spending cuts and tax increases take effect on January 1 is very real.
Global markets are well aware of the danger of the United States falling over the “fiscal cliff,” and are watching nervously.
They know that this outcome could well throw the US – and the world – back into recession.
Foreign ministries around the world should be equally nervous.
Unless the US can get its fiscal house in order, it will be forced to abdicate leadership on a wide range of critical global issues.
In the short term, Syria and its neighbors are already paying the price of America’s inability to focus on anything other than domestic politics since Obama’s re-election.
In my view, the Syrian crisis is at a tipping point: while it is now apparent that the opposition will eventually win and President Bashar al-Assad will fall, the endgame’s duration will be a key element determining who actually comes into power and on what terms.
Syria’s implosion, and the chaos and extremism that are likely to breed there, will threaten the entire Middle East: the stability of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia hangs in the balance.
But we do not even know who will succeed Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State when Obama’s second term formally begins in January, or who will be on the White House security team.
In the medium term, the world abounds with tensions and potential crises that US leadership is likely to be indispensable to resolving.
As events over the past two weeks in Egypt have demonstrated all too vividly, the Arab awakening is still only in its first act in many countries.
Indeed, democracy is fragile, at best, across North Africa; and, in the Middle East, Jordan, the Palestinian territories, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia have only begun to feel the ripples of the tidal wave sweeping the region.
Bahrain remains a flashpoint; Iraq is deeply unstable; and the simmering conflict between Iran and Israel could flare up at any time.
Even when the US is not on the front lines, it has played a vital role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy, nudging wary rivals closer to one another to create a united opposition, and working with regional leaders like Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia to broker deals.
In Asia, the US has been playing a similar role in pushing for multilateral resolution of dangerous bilateral disputes between China and its many neighbors over territories in the East and South China Seas, while at the same time restraining US allies who might otherwise provoke crises.
And, on big global issues like climate change, organized crime, trade, and prevention of atrocities, the absence of the US as a policy catalyst and active negotiator will be quickly and keenly felt.
Avoiding this fate requires the US to “rebuild itself at home,” as the Obama administration’s 2010 National Security Strategy promises.
But, if US politicians spend the next two years the way they have spent the last two – patching together temporary policy fixes while avoiding the hard issues that voters and markets expect them to face – America’s voice will grow fainter, and weaker, in international institutions and affairs.
Equally worrisome is the prospect of deep, across-the-board cuts in the US defense budget at a time when many rising powers are increasing their defense spending.
As much as many countries may dislike the US military, the availability and extraordinary capabilities of America’s soldiers, ships, aircraft, and intelligence assets often function as a global insurance policy.
In the long term, the challenge is more vague, but deeper.
The longer the US obsesses over its own political dysfunction and attendant economic stagnation, the less likely it is to bear the mantle of global responsibility and leadership.
Openly isolationist political forces, such as the Tea Party and libertarians like Ron Paul, will grow stronger.
A retreating US will, in turn, guarantee the emergence of what foreign-policy analyst Ian Bremmer describes as a “G-Zero world,” in which no country will take the lead and marshal the necessary economic and political coalitions to solve collective problems.
Individual presidents and secretaries of state will certainly try.
But, without Congressional support, they will bring fewer and fewer resources to the table and will suffer from an increasing credibility gap when they seek to negotiate with other countries.
Global leaders can do more than stand by and watch.
Why not remind US politicians of their global responsibilities?
The G-7 or G-8 leaders could issue a statement, for instance, urging the US to get its fiscal house in order.
NATO allies could make a similar statement.
Indeed, other regional organizations, such as the African Union or the Arab League, could weigh in.
Even G-20 members, were they so moved, could make a statement.
Of course, when we think about the G-20, we immediately wonder who, other than the US, could organize the issuance of such a statement.
That is precisely the problem, and it could get much worse.

Hungary’s Disease Dictator
BUDAPEST – What critics justifiably call the “enabling act” that the Hungarian parliament passed on March 30 allows Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree for an unlimited period, supposedly to help the government fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
In fact, the new law endangers the lives of many Hungarians by empowering the government to limit drastically information about the management of the virus.
The deadly consequences of such an approach are well known from Wuhan, China, where the authorities initially suppressed information about the outbreak of a novel coronavirus.
Orbán’s enabling act neutralizes the few remaining channels of democratic accountability left in Hungary.
It will bring about an extreme centralization of control over the flow of information about the pandemic and its management.
And Orbán, in power since 2010, desperately needs to control the pandemic narrative, given his governments’ severe underinvestment in the country’s health-care system over the last decade.
The new law gives him that power.
For example, it makes spreading “false” information about the virus punishable by up to five years in prison – a real sword hanging over the head of doctors and journalists alike.
The justification contained in the relevant provision, together with the punishment, is nearly indistinguishable from a similar measure in Saudi Arabia.
In effect, the enabling act minimizes the remaining room for Hungary’s independent media.
The Orbán government’s draconian measures in this regard are exceptional among European Union member states.
Other EU countries generally are fighting fake news and misinformation about COVID-19 through soft means, such as promoting links to official information on the government’s or the World Health Organization’s websites, or working with fact-checkers.
That approach is working: the countries that have best managed the pandemic so far are those where information continues to flow freely and trusted medical experts play a prominent role in public debates.
By contrast, US President Donald Trump initially dismissed the COVID-19 threat, while the United Kingdom’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, treated it as a joke before becoming infected and ending up in intensive care.
Both countries are now suffering from COVID-19 outbreaks more severe than China’s.
In a highly uncertain situation, the uninhibited flow of information enables the collection of dispersed data, comparison of the effects of different strategies for managing the crisis, and greater government accountability.
It is also crucial for combating misinformation, rumors, and fake news, whether these come from political leaders or citizens.
The accountability that a free media brings has forced even the most self-serving and narcissistic leaders, like Trump, to abandon denial and take a more realistic approach to fighting the pandemic.
Moreover, during a public-health crisis, the free flow of information helps governments and citizens to synchronize their actions.
The more that citizens trust that governmental sources of information are subject to independent scrutiny, the more likely they will be to obey official instructions and help to manage the crisis effectively.
The South Korean government, for example, has so far managed to control the spread of COVID-19 without implementing a strict physical lockdown – in part because the authorities have collected and published extensive information about infected citizens, including their ages, movements, and districts of residence.
This was possible because the public trusted the government to be able to design policies to handle the pandemic.
Truthful information entering from outside could save lives in authoritarian countries.
Following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union, news broadcasts by Radio Free Europe helped inform ordinary Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarussians of the scale of the disaster.
Despite all the levers of state control, public pressure forced the Soviet authorities to open up about the crisis, and to accept Western help in fighting it.
This time, however, the information required for public control over the crisis is dispersed within the country.
During the first days of the pandemic, Orbán, like Trump, dismissed the threat, blaming the spread of the coronavirus (as with all other problems) on foreigners.
But reports of Hungarian parents’ uncoordinated efforts to bar their children from going to school subsequently convinced the government to take the pandemic more seriously.
Moreover, as Hungary’s political opposition – and, more importantly, doctors and other health-care workers – began to speak out, older members of Orbán’s Fidesz party became fearful and put pressure on the government to act.
But, by giving Orbán the power to rule by decree, the enabling act has rendered ineffective the country’s remaining key mechanisms of political accountability.
Orbán is not alone in seeing the pandemic as an opportunity to invoke emergency powers and seize near-dictatorial authority.
But the enabling act represents merely his latest step along the autocratic path he embarked on a decade ago.
Intoxicated by the vast powers he had already accumulated, Orbán decided to face the pandemic with the help of a law that supposedly will “guarantee the security of life and health and the personal and material security of citizens and businesses.”
The new legislation will do nothing of the sort, which is one reason why the EU must urgently implement a standardized system for member states to report on the pandemic, along with initiatives to support a free press.
Such measures can save lives.

Brexit In Reverse?
LONDON – Economic reality is beginning to catch up with the false hopes of many Britons.
One year ago, when a slim majority voted for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, they believed the promises of the popular press, and of the politicians who backed the Leave campaign, that Brexit would not reduce their living standards.
Indeed, in the year since, they have managed to maintain those standards by running up household debt.
This worked for a while, because the increase in household consumption stimulated the economy.
But the moment of truth for the UK economy is fast approaching.
As the latest figures published by the Bank of England show, wage growth in Britain is not keeping up with inflation, so real incomes have begun to fall.
As this trend continues in the coming months, households will soon realize that their living standards are falling, and they will have to adjust their spending habits.
To make matters worse, they will also realize that they have become over-indebted and will have to deleverage, thus further reducing the household consumption that has sustained the economy.
Moreover, the BoE has made the same mistake as the average household: it underestimated the impact of inflation and will now be catching up by raising interest rates in a pro-cyclical manner.
These higher rates will make household debt even harder to pay off.
The British are fast approaching the tipping point that characterizes all unsustainable economic trends.
I refer to such a tipping point as “reflexivity” – when both cause and effect shape each other.
Economic reality is reinforced by political reality.
The fact is that Brexit is a lose-lose proposition, harmful both to Britain and the EU.
The Brexit referendum cannot be undone, but people can change their minds.
Apparently, this is happening.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s attempt to strengthen her negotiating position by holding a snap election badly misfired: she lost her parliamentary majority and created a hung parliament (no single party has a majority).
The primary cause of May’s defeat was her fatal misstep in proposing that elderly people pay for a substantial portion of their social care out of their own resources, usually the value of the homes that they have lived in all of their lives.
This “dementia tax,” as it became widely known, deeply offended the core constituency, the elderly, of May’s Conservative Party.
Many either did not vote, or supported other parties.
The increased participation of young people was also an important contributing factor in May’s defeat.
Many of them voted for Labour in protest, not because they wanted to join a trade union or because they support Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (although he gave an unexpectedly impressive performance throughout the campaign).
The attitude of Britain’s young people to the single market is diametrically opposed to that of May and supporters of a “hard” Brexit.
Young people are eager to find well-paying jobs, whether in Britain or elsewhere in Europe.
In that respect, their interests correspond with the interests of the City of London, where some of those jobs are to be found.
If May wants to remain in power, she must change her approach to the Brexit negotiations.
And there are signs that she is prepared to do so.
By approaching the negotiations that will start on June 19 in a conciliatory spirit, May could reach an understanding with the EU on the agenda and agree to continue as a member of the single market for a period long enough to carry out all the legal work that will be needed.
This would be a great relief to the EU, because it would postpone the evil day when Britain’s absence would create an enormous hole in the EU’s budget.
That would be a win-win arrangement.
Only by taking this path can May hope to persuade Parliament to pass all the laws that need to be in place once the Brexit talks are completed and Britain withdraws from the Union.
She may have to abandon her ill-considered alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party in Ulster and side more emphatically with the Tories of Scotland, who are keen on a softer version of Brexit.
May will also need to atone for the sins of the Tories in the London borough of Kensington with regard to last week’s Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 30 people, and perhaps many more, lost their lives.
If May embraces such a platform, she could then carry on leading a minority government, because nobody else would want to take her place.
Brexit would still take at least five years to complete, during which time new elections would take place.
If all went well, the two parties might want to remarry even before they have divorced.

The Cruelty of Chance
MOSCOW – In Russia, somewhere behind every event lurks the question: Who is to blame?
In the tragedy that claimed the lives of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 other Polish leaders, we can answer that question with certainty in at least one respect: history is to blame.
The event is so hideous that it seems like a bad joke, or an evil KGB plot, a mad conspiracy out of James Bond – or some combination of all three.
Yet the crash that has sent all of Poland into mourning was none of these things.
A tragedy that defies any logical explanation confirms only one thing: the cruelty of chance.
What if no fog prevented the safe landing at Smolensk airport?
What if the plane was not a 20-year-old, Russian-made Tupolev-154, but a newer and safer model?
What if the Polish pilot had obeyed the Russian air traffic controller who tried to divert the plane to Moscow or Minsk?
Unfortunately, the cruelty of chance also lies at the heart of the centuries of mistrust between Poland and Russia.
The irony (if there is an irony at all) is that this tragedy came at a time when mistrust seemed, at long last, to be giving way to better, more businesslike relations and greater understanding between the two countries.
After 70 years of denial, Russia’s leadership (if not yet ordinary Russians) were ready to admit that Joseph Stalin’s NKVD (precursor to the KGB) slaughtered more than 20,000 Polish officers, intellectuals, and clergy in the nearby Katyn forest in 1940.
Indeed, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer himself, invited his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk, to commemorate that tragedy together.
But Kaczynski, a member of Solidarity in the 1980’s who was eager to overthrow the communist regime, was more mistrustful of the Russians than Tusk.
He put together his own delegation to visit Katyn, and wondered aloud if the Russians would give him a visa.
Certainly, no Russians were invited.
When the pilot of the presidential plane (ironically, again, Soviet made) was advised not to land in the thick fog, either he, or perhaps even the president himself, may have mistrusted the Russians’ willingness to give honest advice.
Indeed, they may well have wondered if the cunning ex-KGB men around Putin simply wanted to make Kaczynski’s Katyn commemoration a mockery?
Russian-Polish suspicions and disagreements date back to the sixteenth century, when Poland was the far greater power; indeed, the Grand Duchy of Moscow was a backwater.
Across the centuries, there have been wars, started by both sides, and partitions of Poland executed by the Russians, followed by attempts at “Russification,” with the Russian Christian Orthodox Empire trying to control the “silver-tongued,” “deceptive,” West European-oriented Catholic Poland.
Then there was the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which the Poles refused to join, and Marshal Jozef Pilsudski’s miraculous victory over the Red Army at the gates of Warsaw in 1920.
Throughout the interwar years, Poland and the nascent Soviet regime were at daggers drawn almost without interruption.
When Stalin signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Nazi Germany in 1939, it gave him an opportunity to invade Poland.
The Katyn massacre was a direct result, with Stalin ordering the mass murder of Poland’s elite in order to decapitate Polish society and thus make it more pliable.
Katyn was also the occasion for the Soviets to break off relations with Poland’s wartime government-in-exile in London.
Because the Polish leaders refused to exonerate the Russians, Stalin accused the Poles of collaborating with the Germans in trying to shift the blame for Nazi crimes onto Russians.
Soon after, the idea of establishing a puppet regime in Warsaw took root.
Although the Nazi-Soviet Pact did not last long – Germany invaded Russia in 1941 – for Poland there was no way out.
With Hitler’s defeat, it once again became part of the Russian sphere, this time of Soviet Russia.
But Poland never stopped striding – and striking – for independence.
The rise of Solidarity in the 1980’s was the earliest and most severe blow to the stagnating Soviet system.
The Polish-born Pope John Paul II crystallized the anti-communist “threat” that Poland now posed to the Soviet Union.
The Pope’s call for religious freedom around the world, including in the socialist countries, rubbed the atheistic Soviets – and Orthodox Russians – the wrong way.
Indeed, throughout the twentieth century, animosity between Poland and Russia remained at fever pitch, manifested not only in politics but also culturally.
This, of course, continued an old pattern, too.
Alexander Pushkin, Nicolai Gogol, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were all suspicious of the Poles, calling them “cold,” “distant,” and “manipulative,” and seeing Poland as always on the side of the West, rather than standing with its Slavic brothers. Indeed, Pushkin’s friendship with Adam Mickiewicz ended in acrimony over the 1830 Polish insurrection against Tsarist rule.
In fact, the animosity ran so deep that when both countries were no longer communist, and Russia was looking to replace its November 7 Bolshevik Revolution holiday, it came up with November 4, the anniversary of the Russian boyars’ victory in 1612 over Polish King Sigismund’s short-lived occupation of Moscow.
Now there is talk, in both Warsaw and Moscow, that the second tragedy of Katyn might usher in a new era in bilateral relations.
Perhaps so, but as the Polish essayist Stanislaw Jerzy Lec said: “You can close your eyes to reality, but not to memories.”

Erdoğan the Peacemaker?
ISTANBUL – Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has taken on a daunting challenge.
After participating in the nuclear-security summit in South Korea at the end of March, he went to Tehran to urge Iran’s leaders to make a deal during the next round of nuclear talks between Iran and the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members (Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States) plus Germany.
And Erdoğan will host those talks in Istanbul in mid-April.
Erdoğan last traveled to Tehran in May 2010 to finalize an agreement that he had negotiated under which Iran was to send large quantities of its low-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for nuclear fuel for Iran’s research reactor.
The deal, mediated by Turkey and Brazil, was presented to the rest of the world as a groundbreaking confidence-building initiative.
But the US and its allies quickly rejected the agreement as an Iranian ploy designed to halt the growing momentum for additional sanctions.
Turkey’s insistence on pressing ahead with the deal caused tension with the US and fueled criticism at home and abroad that Erdoğan’s government was shifting away from its long-standing alliance with the West.
The memory of this short-lived crisis with the US is still fresh in Turkish government circles.
So why, despite having burned his fingers two years ago, is Erdoğan taking up the issue again?
What did he hope to accomplish in Tehran?
Much has changed in the Middle East during the past two years, and not to Turkey’s advantage.
As a result, Turkey is now seeking to contain a rapidly deteriorating regional security situation.
Events in Syria are forcing Turkish authorities to accept the harsh reality of the Assad regime’s resilience – and now its hostility towards Turkey.
Iraq, another of Turkey’s neighbors, faces the risk of a protracted sectarian power struggle following withdrawal of US troops.
Given this, Turkey’s main objective now is to prevent a military intervention against Iran.
From Turkey’s perspective, an Israeli or American strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities would destabilize the region further, as Iran would undoubtedly retaliate by fueling sectarian tensions and undermining the prospects of a settlement in both Syria and Iraq.
As a result, Turkey wants to prolong, at all costs, the time available for diplomacy.
But Erdoğan’s specific objective was more modest this time than it was in 2010, because Turkey does not want to play the role of mediator and will not seek to negotiate the details of an agreement.
Instead, Erdoğan emphasized to his Iranian counterparts the international community’s resolve to bring transparency to Iran’s nuclear program, and insisted on the importance of concrete progress in the next round of the nuclear talks.
He warned that Iranian intransigence would doom the talks to failure, raising the prospects of yet another military confrontation in the Middle East.
In particular, Erdoğan stressed the need for Iran to offer a gesture of goodwill about its nuclear program.
The Iranian regime should, at the very least, commit itself to halt uranium enrichment at 20%, a figure short of the threshold needed to produce weapons.
Having had direct meetings with both Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Erdoğan was in a unique position, as a prime minister of a NATO country, to convey these critical messages to a regime whose top-level decision-making processes remain as opaque as ever to the West.
Paradoxically, however, Erdoğan’s task, while more modest than in 2010, is also more difficult, owing to the prospect of new sanctions on Iran, including a ban on oil exports, that are to enter into force in July.
Advocates of sanctions argue that they are having a crippling effect on the Iranian economy.
The value of the Iranian rial has fallen by 50% against the US dollar since the beginning of the year, and the country is suffering from a severe shortage of foreign exchange. So now is not the time to pull back.
Moreover, US President Barack Obama, facing an election in November, does not wish to be accused of being soft on Iran, making it difficult for the West to reciprocate potential Iranian overtures.
Yet Erdoğan’s best ally in his risky gambit may be the US consumer.
Faced with rising gasoline prices as a result of the ongoing crisis with Iran, Americans’ concerns about the cost of driving have contributed to Obama’s shaky popularity ratings.
Thus, the Obama administration may find it more politically expedient to seek a deal with Iran.
If Iran displays a real willingness to compromise, the West should hold off on the new sanctions.
It will soon become clear whether Erdoğan’s visit succeeds.
If Iran decides to engage the international community with concrete confidence-building measures at the next round of multilateral talks, Erdoğan will take much of the credit for giving diplomacy a last chance – and quite possibly for averting a disastrous military confrontation in the Middle East.

Forget the Vaccine Patent Waiver
NEW HAVEN – The surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India shows that the pandemic is far from over.
While most developing countries in Asia and Africa managed to keep their death tolls low over the past year, it is only a matter of time before the new, more contagious variants that have emerged in India and elsewhere spread to countries that seemed to have their infections under control.
Absent a miracle – such as a mutation that renders the virus less lethal – only universal vaccination can end this cycle of misery.
With that goal in mind, a global movement has emerged to demand a World Trade Organization waiver of patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines (as well as treatments and diagnostics).
But patent protections are not the primary cause of the vaccine-supply bottleneck.
If anything, a waiver might divert scarce materials from vaccine production facilities that are already up and running, not to mention discourage investments in pharmaceuticals to ward off future pandemics.
Intellectual-property protection for pharmaceuticals has a long, uncomfortable history, especially in developing countries.
When the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) was signed in 1995, an overwhelming majority of economists – including those strongly in favor of free trade – condemned it.
They objected to an agreement that obliges all WTO member states to recognize and enforce patents in all fields of technology, including pharmaceuticals.
While the case for general patent protection has a strong foundation in economic principles, there is no rationale for harmonizing patent protection across rich and poor countries.
As I argued in 2010, the pharmaceutical industry at the time was losing only a tiny sliver of its profits from patent infringements in developing countries.
And worse, IP enforcement could result in lost or delayed access to life-saving medicines in countries that would no longer be able to produce or import generic versions of patented drugs.
Against this historical backdrop, the demand for a COVID-19 patent waiver is understandable.
The problem is that the underlying issues have changed fundamentally.
As a recent World Bank working paper by Ruchir Agarwal and Tristan Reed finds, “production capacity for vaccines does not appear to be the binding constraint” in global procurement.
After all, there are now at least ten COVID-19 vaccines with a demonstrated efficacy above 50% (the threshold set by the US Federal Drug Administration in its June 30, 2020, “guidance for industry”).
Though efficacy varies across vaccines and variants tested, all of the vaccines being administered provide significant protection against hospitalization and death.
Moreover, the ten companies producing them have production targets for 2021 that would be sufficient to vaccinate 93% of the world population.
What’s the issue, then?
According to Agarwal and Reed, it is that companies are reluctant to activate their existing production capacity without pre-purchase commitments.
There is currently a large gap between the number of doses that could be produced and the number that have been pre-ordered.
And, as one would expect, this gap is unevenly distributed.
High-income countries have ordered more doses than they need and thus will end up with a surplus, whereas lower-income countries are far behind in pre-purchasing vaccines.
Under these circumstances, efforts to increase capacity by relaxing patent protections would do nothing to accelerate vaccinations in lower-income countries.
A far more promising strategy is to help lower-income countries purchase vaccines, while channeling surplus doses from richer countries to wherever they are needed most.
To a large extent, this strategy is already being implemented, thanks to the efforts of the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment facility, together with concessional loans by multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, and regional initiatives such as the one being led by the African Union.
Remarkably, Agarwal and Reed show that the COVAX AMC facility and the AU initiative already have ensured that most African countries have ordered enough vaccines to cover at least 50% of their populations.
Still, three critical challenges remain.
First, closing the pre-purchase gap of 350 million vaccines will requires an additional $4 billion – a trivial cost relative to the potential benefit of achieving worldwide immunity.
Providing this support, either through additional funding for the COVAX AMC facility or by sending surplus vaccines to developing countries as soon as possible, should not be too difficult or costly for high-income countries to manage.
Second, the World Bank needs to relax its conditions for extending loans for vaccine pre-purchases.
Currently, such loans can be used only for vaccines approved by three stringent regulatory authorities (SRAs) in three different regions.
Among these are Japan and certain Western countries, which naturally prioritize approval of vaccines intended for their own populations.
They have little incentive to grant emergency-use authorization to alternative vaccines that have shown high efficacy in Phase 3 clinical trials, such as Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin (India), and Gamaleya’s Sputnik V (Russia), and Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac (China).
Extending the list of national regulators classified as SRAs would go a long way toward increasing lending for vaccine purchases.
Finally, existing vaccine manufacturers will be unable to meet their production targets if vaccine nationalism gives rise to export restrictions on critical inputs and raw materials.
We saw such behavior early in the pandemic with respect to personal protective equipment, but the resulting export restrictions proved short-lived.
One hopes the same will be true for vaccines.
International cooperation and coordination will be crucial in the coming months.
There are many ways for advanced economies to assist poorer countries in vaccinating their populations as soon as possible.
But relaxing patent protections – however appealing the idea may be in other contexts – is not one of them.
The focus should be on providing additional funding and less restrictive lending for pre-ordering vaccines, and on funneling surpluses from high-income countries to the rest of the world.

Balancing the State and the Market
BERLIN – The financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2008 will, in retrospect, be regarded as a transformative moment, because it raised fundamental questions about the future shape of our economic systems. These questions are not so much about the end of capitalism – as some perceive or even desire – but rather about the different ways in which capitalism is understood in different countries.
What we are witnessing today is a reversal of the debates of the 1980’s. Back then, Ronald Reagan used to joke: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government and I’m here to help!”
Now that governments have spent trillions of dollars, euros, yen, and pounds on stabilizing financial markets and the economy in general, those words seem far less terrifying.
In fact, faith in the market has been dented, while trust in government and regulation is increasing.
After decades of consensus that the state should set the rules and otherwise leave the private sector alone, the state is now widely seen as a beneficial force that should play an active role in the economy.
This is happening despite the lack of a clear indication of the superiority of the state.
On the contrary, the US government’s heavy intervention in the American housing market is probably the most pertinent example of the state’s shortcomings, one that no doubt contributed significantly to the crisis.
I sense a growing willingness to forego the benefits of innovation – not least financial innovation – in exchange for a slower pace of change, which is assumed to be more controllable.
This shift will not only impede future growth, but could bring other dangers as well.
The fiscal balances of the G-20 economies will deteriorate dramatically as a result of the crisis. Deficits will improve somewhat as economies recover and support measures are withdrawn.
Most governments have used their stimulus packages to serve vested interests as well. The accumulated debt will constitute a lasting burden on public finances.
Moreover, we must remember that budgets were already strained before the crisis, and that governments’ balances do not reflect all aspects of reality.
In Germany, for example, overall debt jumps from the current 65% of GDP to 250% when pension liabilities are included.
Interest payments account for an ever-larger share of budgets – and will continue to grow when interest rates start to rise again.
In the absence of strong political commitment and credible plans for gradual fiscal consolidation, there is a distinct risk that at some point sovereign yields will rise markedly – with negative implications for the economy and politics.
The second danger is that governments will continue to see it as their duty to decide which firms to save and which to let fail.
A line must be drawn between a time of crisis, when emergency measures are needed to avert economic collapse, and normal circumstances, in which the full force of market mechanisms applies.
The instinct of governments, however, may be to revert to the idea of protecting national champions or reasserting national sovereignty in some sectors.
But instinct is not necessarily a sound basis for decision-making. And in times of globalization, distinguishing between “national” and “foreign” is neither appropriate nor feasible.
In order to preserve the state’s ability to act while avoiding competitive distortions between and within industries, we should establish criteria to guide future decisions in this area.
As a matter of principle, companies that were in trouble prior to a severe economic crisis should not be eligible for state assistance of the type that the world recently witnessed. Moreover, aid must be limited, lest firms become addicted to it.
Governments should also be aware of the long-term costs: large-scale state interference in market processes will produce its own set of corporate winners and losers.
Structural change may be delayed, depriving us of the opportunities offered by the crisis to build more competitive and dynamic industries – and accelerating the relative global decline of mature economies.
Indeed, the third danger is that greater state intervention in the economy entails a shift away from globalization, paving the way for various forms of national protectionism.
We can see this in the financial industry, where increased state ownership has led to a distinct danger of re-nationalization and re-fragmentation of financial markets.
Many financial institutions that received government funds have concentrated on their respective home markets and scaled back their activities abroad.
Similarly, there is a risk that new regulation may, either deliberately or as an unintended side effect, lead to re-nationalization of markets.
It is understandable that governments seek solace in the presumed safety of national markets. But the shelter that national markets provide is illusory: the only way to increase the resilience of financial markets and to ensure that recurrence of this kind of crisis becomes less likely is to build a regulatory framework that is commensurate with integrated markets.
We need global (or at least European) rules, and we need strong institutional structures to enforce these rules – a requirement that is not necessarily limited to the financial markets.
We must resist the temptation to believe that a meddling, paternalistic state is the way of the future. Not only business, but also society as a whole, would lose out if we moved in that direction.
Or, as has been said by many: “A government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have.”
This text is an abridgment of a keynote address given at a Berlin conference on post-crisis economic policies, hosted by the Center on Capitalism and Society, Columbia University, 11-12 December 2009.

Why We Need Political Islam
MADRID – US President Donald Trump has put on the back burner an executive order that would designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group.
He should leave it there permanently.
Inclusive governments that are seen to represent the overwhelmingly devout Muslim societies of the Arab world are a vital antidote to global jihadism.
To be sure, the Muslim Brotherhood has not always fully embodied democratic values.
In Egypt, for example, President Mohamed Morsi’s government treated democracy as a winner-take-all proposition – and was ousted after little more than a year.
But addressing such shortcomings by ostracizing legitimate religious-political options merely reinforces jihadist recruiters’ argument that violence is the only way to secure reform.
That’s what happened when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi – Morsi’s successor after the 2013 coup d’état – adopted a zero-sum approach to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Where Islamist parties have been given space for political action, they have shown a capacity to take advantage of it, often advocating political participation as a superior alternative to violence.
And, indeed, Islamist parties, including the Muslim Brotherhood, are engaged in legitimate political activities in several countries – activities that have often driven them to moderate their views.
Politics, unlike religion, is a realm not of eternal truths, but of rational calculations.
To govern effectively, one must build alliances and coalitions, including with secular and liberal parties.
Given this, political engagement naturally tends to pull parties toward moderation, a phenomenon we have seen time and again in the Arab world.
In Morocco, when the Justice and Development Party (PJD) entered politics in 1997, “Islamization” was at the heart of its electoral platform.
Likewise, Tunisia’s Ennahda (Renaissance) party was originally shaped by the legacy of the Iranian revolution and the thinking of radical Islamist critics of Western values, such as Sayyid Qutb, a leading Muslim Brotherhood theorist in the 1950s.
But both the PJD and Ennahda – which came to power in their respective countries in 2011 – have for years been edging toward moderation, even secularization.
They have deemphasized some of their radical principles to accommodate key tenets of secular democracy, such as cultural pluralism and freedom of expression.
In 2003, in response to a terror attack in Casablanca, the PJD created a clear division between the political party and the religious movement that created it, and unconditionally renounced violence.
Unlike a jihadist group, which would have happily taken credit for such an attack, the PJD wanted to make it clear that it neither inspired nor condoned such actions.
In 2015, Ennahda, too, separated the movement that promotes religious values from the party that adheres to the secular logic of the political game.
Critics who argue that these parties were merely maneuvering tactically are not entirely wrong.
But such tactical moves can lead to strategic and even ideological shifts.
Indeed, once separated from the constraints of religious dogma, the political branches of both parties distanced themselves from their fundamentalist Islamist roots.
Involvement in politics also had a moderating impact on Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood.
While Morsi was president, he respected Egypt’s peace agreement with Israel and even played a key role in brokering a ceasefire in the 2012 conflict between Israel and Hamas.
Those decisions demonstrated his resolve to uphold Egypt’s role as a force for regional stability, which implied refusing to allow his ideology to drive him toward a radical foreign policy.
Algeria’s Islamists took a slightly different route, moderating their politics after their defeat in the devastating civil war of the 1990s.
While the memory of that civil war is now fading, the example of the conflicts in Syria and Libya – together with the political engagement of Islamist parties, such as the Movement for the Society of Peace – is enough to drive most young Algerians away from jihadism.
Just as political participation can encourage moderation, political exclusion can reinforce radicalism.
Consider the case of Hamas, which is not a global jihadist movement, but rather a nationalist Islamist organization whose iron-fisted rule in Gaza brooks no dissent.
One might argue that the international community’s refusal to recognize Hamas’s victory when it came to power in an election in 2006 stymied the movement’s potential for moderation.
After all, in contrast to global jihadist groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, Hamas has often flirted, however obliquely, with a more conciliatory approach toward Israel.
Even without political recognition, Hamas has reportedly decided to publish a new charter without the rampant anti-Semitism found in the current one.
There is also reason to believe that Hamas would accept a two-state solution, and declare its independence from the Muslim Brotherhood, in order to facilitate its reconciliation with Egypt and other leading Arab states.
If Hamas does prove itself to be moving toward greater political pragmatism, it should be encouraged.
In particular, Israel should treat Gaza as if it were an independent state and promote its stability.
This means ending Israel’s blockade – which has served only to fuel more extremism and war – and granting Gazans control over their own seaport for trade and travel.
Creating space for benign expressions of Islam in the public sphere is essential to defeat global jihadism.
Only when the war against jihadism shifts from the battlefield to the political arena can Arab societies move toward a more secure and prosperous future.

The Ransom Dilemma
PRINCETON – Anyone who does not share the ideology of the so-called “Islamic State” in Iraq and Syria is likely to agree that it is wrong for the group’s adherents to behead some of those they have held hostage.
Much more controversial, however, are the secret decisions by European governments to pay such groups ransoms for the release of their nationals.
Although the Islamic State’s hostages have come from several countries, so far it has beheaded only those from the United States and the United Kingdom.
The only European hostage reported to have been executed directly by the Islamic State appears to have been a Russian, Sergey Gorbunov, but little is known about him.
No friend or relative has come forward, and no video of his death has been released.
Russian officials have publicly doubted that he was a Russian citizen.
On the other hand, the Islamic State has released 15 hostages, including citizens of Italy, France, Switzerland, Denmark, and Spain.
Rukmini Callimachi, reporting for the New York Times, has explained the difference in treatment.
The US and UK governments have a long-standing policy of refusing to pay ransoms to terrorist organizations.
Moreover, when Michael Foley, brother of James Foley, one of the hostages, received a ransom demand, the FBI warned him that under US law, to pay money to terrorists is a crime.
Foley was later executed.
By contrast, for more than a decade several European governments have been willing to pay terrorists millions of euros for the release of their captive citizens, or have facilitated the payment of ransoms by relatives and friends of hostages.
This is notwithstanding the United Nations Security Council’s unanimous adoption in January of a resolution opposing payment of such ransoms, and a similar declaration at last year’s G-8 summit – which was signed by some of the governments that have continued to pay.
France has, according to Callimachi, paid more ransom money than any other country – a total of $58 million since 2008, including a single payment of $40 million in 2013 for four French citizens captured in Mali.
But French policy may be changing.
After France participated in airstrikes against the Islamic State in September 2014, an Algerian jihadist group captured Hervé Gourdel, a French tourist, and threatened to execute him unless France renounced its participation in the operations.
This time France stood firm, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying that to retreat one inch would be to hand victory to the militants.
Gourdel was beheaded.
The pressure on governments to pay ransoms, or at least facilitate the payment of ransoms by families desperate to save their loved ones’ lives, is understandable.
It is an application of the so-called “Rule of Rescue”: our perceived duty to spend almost any amount to save an identifiable victim, such as a trapped miner, an injured mountain climber, or an extremely premature baby.
We are far less willing to invest in saving lives when the victims cannot be identified in advance, even when the number of lives saved would be higher – for example, by providing better road safety or education in preventive health measures.
The Rule of Rescue should be understood as a rule about human psychology, not about morality.
Applying it can seem justifiable if we put ourselves in the position of a captive, or imagine that our child, parent, or spouse has been captured by terrorists who make a credible offer to release our loved one for a ransom.
But this argument trades on our inability to put ourselves in the position of any of the larger number of people killed by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
They have become victims only because the estimated $125 million in ransom money paid to such groups over the past six years has enabled them to arm more militants to carry out lethal attacks.
We ought to use our resources to save the most lives; and, overall, paying ransoms is likely to lead to more lives being lost.
Moreover, the additional military strength that terrorists gain from ransom revenue is not the only harm caused by paying ransoms.
Ransoming one Western hostage creates an incentive for militants to capture another.
Graeme Wood, a journalist who spent four years working in the Middle East, notes that journalists in dangerous areas were always at risk of being kidnapped or killed for ideological reasons; but it does not help that a Western journalist could be worth millions of dollars, a sum he calls “universally motivating.”
General John Allen, a former US commander in Afghanistan and now President Barack Obama’s special envoy to the international coalition fighting the Islamic State, argues that we cannot know how many Americans have not been kidnapped because the group knows that it will not receive ransoms for them.
He points out that “the fact that there are Americans in the region who were never taken because [the Islamic State and its allies] knew there was no advantage to doing so needs to be factored in.”
Governments that pay ransoms are saving the lives of some of their citizens, but putting the remainder of their citizens – and others – at greater risk.
The refusal to pay ransoms to terrorists can seem callous, but in truth it is the only ethical policy.
Every government should adhere to it.

The Ghost of Appeasement
PRAGUE – One of the fundamental pillars of Europe’s political architecture is a strong and enduring belief in the universal validity of equal, universal, and inalienable human rights.
At the core of this is a belief in the rights of human beings to a life of freedom and the protection of their dignity.
In the years after World War II, this humanist ideal became the basis of Europe’s spiritual and political identity and hence it is contained in the founding documents of the European Union.
Of course, this does not mean that the EU could or would want to conquer the rest of the world in the name of imposing its values, rules and culture on the rest of humanity.
Far from it. What Europe’s devotion to humanism does mean, however, is a determination, no matter the circumstances, to stand firm and not abandon the fundamentals of European civilization and European unification.
As a result, Europe places a primary emphasis on the universality of human rights and freedoms.
To be sure, there are many places around the globe where human rights and civil liberties continue to be trampled underfoot: North Korea, Iran, Burma, Tibet, Zimbabwe, and many others.
This week, a meeting of the EU’s General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will discuss once more relations between the EU and Cuba.
Despite repeated reminders from the EU, the Cuban government has done none of the things that the Union has been urging it to do for many years – above all, to release all political prisoners and stop the persecution of independent civil-society groups and the regime’s political opponents.
On the contrary, the Cuban government continues to detain prisoners of conscience and to criminalize demands for a society-wide dialogue.
This year, the peoples of Europe are marking the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain that once divided Europe in two.
That 20 years after this epochal event an iron curtain remains around Cuba makes this anniversary poignant.
Of course, the tourists who crowd Cuba’s beaches are not aware of this iron curtain.
But, regardless of this ignorance and of its economic interests, the EU should insist on the release of political prisoners and use all international institutions to bring pressure to bear on the Cuban government to respect the human and civil rights of Cuba’s people.
During any negotiations with Cuba’s leaders, European politicians and diplomats should remind their Cuban partners of their obligations. They should also be in contact with Cuban civil society to express their solidarity with the families of the political prisoners.
From its own experiences in the twentieth century, Europe knows what catastrophes can result when concessions are made to evil.
The history of the twentieth century is an object lesson in this.
Time and again, Europe paid a high price for policies of compromises with evil that were dictated by economic interests or the illusion that evil can be appeased and will disappear of its own accord.
The EU should not and must not repeat this error.

Bush’s Road Map to Failure in the Middle East
Six long years of failed Middle East policies have finally brought President George W. Bush to recognize that the alliance of moderates in the region that he covets can only be forged through an Arab-Israeli peace.
Indeed, only by effectively addressing the Israeli-Arab dispute can he possibly salvage America’s standing in the region.
But the round of peacemaking that America has recently embarked upon not only comes too late in the political life of a lame-duck president who has been defeated at home and abroad; it is also ill-conceived and unconvincing.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s adamant resistance to engage the Syrians is not exactly wise policy.
The stakes for a peaceful regional order are too high for Israel and the United States to persist in refusing to put Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s current peace offensive to the test.
The bones of contention that wrecked previous attempts to reach an Israeli-Syrian peace have realistic solutions, as was shown by the back-channel peace talks recently held between an Israeli ex-official and a Syrian with close connections to the regime.
Nor is Rice’s insistence on sticking to the failed “road map” for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement promising.
Susceptible to procrastination and evasion by both sides, the road map was stillborn.
Almost four years after it was first launched, neither of the parties has managed to muster the political will necessary to implement its primary provisions.
Not even the bizarre idea, reserved for the second stage, of a Palestinian state with “temporary borders” is enticing for the Palestinians.
This Gordian knot needs to be cut, not untied.
The concept of interim agreements has now become utterly obsolete, if only because the parties are incapable of paying the political price inherent in an open-ended, piecemeal process.
Instead, what is called for is a sweeping solution to all the core issues.
We now stand at the end of the peace process as we have known it.
From now on, our options will be a violent and unilateral disengagement, such as the one that ushered in the current war in Gaza, and a comprehensive peace plan that will have to be annexed to the road map and validated by an international peace conference.
Only such “reverse engineering,” starting at the end and working backward – and legitimized and monitored by strict international mechanisms – might yet save the prospects for an Israeli/Palestinian peace from ruin.
As the launch of the peace process at the 1991 Madrid International Peace Conference demonstrated, the prospects for peace in the Middle East always needed a concerted international push to exploit windows of opportunity.
Wars in the Middle East, especially those , such as Israel’s recent war against Hezbollah, that ended inconclusively, have almost invariably created the conditions for major political breakthroughs, because they taught the warring parties the limits of power.
Trapped in a momentous struggle between the forces of peaceful change and those committed to Doomsday, the Middle East is once again calling for a major international effort at peacemaking.
The initiators of the 2002 Arab peace initiative likewise understood that a strictly bilateral approach might be inadequate, and instead called to regionalize the solution to the conflict.
Loss of mutual trust between the parties, and their total incapacity to take even the smallest step towards each other, let alone to observe their commitments without prodding by third parties, made (and still makes) an international framework for peace the only way out of the dangerous impasse.
The end of bilateralism stems also from the dysfunctional political systems of both Palestine and Israel.
Today, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is gasping for political air under the smothering control of Hamas.
On her recent trip to Israel, Rice had to listen to four different peace plans from the prime minister, the foreign minister, the minister for strategic threats, and the defense minister.
For both Israelis and Palestinians, achieving internal peace might prove as formidable a challenge as establishing peace with each other.
Any reformed peace process is doomed if it is guided by a road map within which, on the core issues, the parties have diametrically opposed views.
But there is no need to reinvent the wheel, because the solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is embodied in the main peace plans that are already on the table: the Clinton peace parameters, and the all-Arab peace initiative.
Fifteen years after the Madrid Conference began a formal peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, the parties are wiser as to what is inevitable if this tortuous process is to lead to a permanent settlement.
In 1991, they convened on a platform of “land for peace.”
But the Israelis never believed they would have to give back all the land, while the Arabs did not think they might have to offer “all the peace.”
Today, at long last, everyone knows what is meant by “land,” and everyone knows what is meant by “peace.”

The Fed Does Not Deserve All the Inflation Blame
CAMBRIDGE – A growing crescendo of commentary places the blame for the current surge in US inflation squarely on the Federal Reserve. But much of the criticism is stupefyingly naive about the political pressures that the Fed and other central banks around the world have had to navigate in recent years.
In the United States, pressures on the Fed reached a peak when the Democrats, eager to put progressive ideas into practice, took control of the White House and Congress in January 2021.
Yes, the Fed has significant independence in many dimensions, but it does not enjoy nearly the same institutional independence as, say, the European Central Bank.
Instead, the Fed is a creature of Congress that can, in theory, be radically transformed at short notice.
Importantly, the term of the Fed’s chair always expires one year into a new president’s term, and President Joe Biden’s administration was able to make several other Fed appointments as well.
Although the idea of “Fed packing” (adding new positions to tilt the central bank’s voting majority) never gained traction, Fed officials surely noticed the Biden administration’s discussion of whether to counter the US Supreme Court’s conservative majority by increasing the number of justices.
Given Biden’s attempt to administer massive fiscal stimulus, how realistic was it to think that the Fed could have started hiking interest rates in the first half of 2021 as inflation started to rise?
Most economists did not yet view inflation as a major macroeconomic concern.
Let’s remember that when my Harvard colleague Lawrence Summers started gently warning about inflation back in February 2021, many economists did not yet take a durable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for granted.
Moreover, progressives were enthralled by the idea that US federal debt could rise substantially without triggering a significant increase in inflation or interest rates. Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT, an extreme version of this idea that called for the Fed to buy up debt as the Treasury issued it, had many influential adherents in politics and the media.
As recently as February 2022, with annual US inflation running at 7.9%, the New York Times published an admiring profile of leading MMT advocate Stephanie Kelton.
Had the Fed started raising the federal fund rate in the first half of 2021, by even a quarter or half a percentage point, the Biden administration would have made sure that the central bank owned any downturn that followed. And MMT proponents would have said that their experiment was never given a chance.
This would have been a highly effective critique of the Fed, given how long inflation had been dormant. Prior to the pandemic, except for a few extreme cases such as Argentina and Venezuela, inflation seemed to have disappeared.
At the same time, low prevailing interest rates meant that many governments felt emboldened to run much bigger fiscal deficits.
Respected centrist economists such as Olivier Blanchard had argued prominently that governments should be much less concerned about debt than in the past because interest rates would remain very low relative to GDP growth rates.
Others emphasized that governments should allow debt to increase in recessions and crises, but not worry too much about actively bringing it down during booms.
Inflation, it seemed, was not a big concern.
Indeed, so-called “helicopter money,” or the financing by central banks of fiscal deficits, was being widely promoted as a way to stimulate economies when monetary policymakers found themselves unable to cut interest rates that were already near zero.
Although some of us argued forcefully that MMT and even its softer variants were deeply misguided, it was a seductive idea, and, until inflation actually got out of control, its flaws were difficult to demonstrate decisively.
In a way, the Biden administration’s experiment with hyper-stimulus in a growing economy was one that was demanding to be tried, and progressives would have taken aim at the Fed had it stood in the way.
But while that might explain why the Fed refrained from hiking rates initially, why did it still refuse to act when price growth accelerated in late 2021?
Part of the explanation may be that Fed economists really thought inflationary pressures were temporary.
But Biden’s decision to hold back his reappointment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell until late November also played an influential role. Had the Fed begun increasing rates in the second half of 2021, the president would likely have replaced Powell with someone more dovish, and markets would immediately have discounted the hikes.
Is there any way the Fed can better insulate itself from such pressures in the future?
I do fault the Fed for not taking seriously in 2019 the idea of a deep negative interest-rate policy as a way of cushioning against deflation.
To be fair, the economics profession has badly lagged in that regard as well.
Much of the intellectual resistance to deeply negative interest rates is curiously superficial and needs to be addressed the next time the Fed reviews its monetary framework.
If the Fed had a more powerful tool for fighting deflation, it would likely have been braver about raising interest rates sooner as inflation picked up.
The full effect of monetary policy on inflation typically takes a few quarters to appear, and the Fed needs the confidence to be more agile.
In sum, the Fed certainly bears its share of blame for the great inflation of the 2020s. But powerful political pressures from the left and overly-optimistic analyses of open-ended debt policy, not to mention genuine uncertainties about inflation and real interest rates, also played a very large role.

Japan’s Vote for Bold Reform
TOKYO – With the powerful mandate of the Japanese people, demonstrated by their overwhelming vote of support in our country’s December 14 election, my government’s ability to act decisively has been strengthened immeasurably.
Indeed, we now not only have the authority to act, but a clear and definitive message from the electorate that we must do so.
In particular, we now have a mandate to launch what has become known around the world as the “third arrow” of so-called Abenomics: structural reform.
And it is structural reform that will unleash the competitiveness, and long-pent-up dynamism, of Japan’s firms and people.
By calling in November for a snap general election, my aim was to consolidate the government’s political capital – not in order to hoard it, but to spend it on the reforms that were first promised two years ago.
Now, with our renewed mandate, that is what we will do.
First, we intend to subject Japan’s tax regime to a fundamental review.
This entails not only an increase in the consumption-tax rate, the second round of which we have postponed, but also making the necessary adjustments so that our tax system no longer impairs investment incentives.
Some of the agro-business organizations – the epitome of vested interests – must change, and we will push them to do so.
Second, we must adapt Japan’s labor regulations to the norms of modern life almost everywhere, which means allowing every individual to strike a beneficial balance between life and work.
We Japanese will always work hard – I have no doubt about that.
But we also need to enable and encourage more Japanese women to participate in the workforce, whether at the beginning of their careers, or after choosing to have and raise children.
Moreover, it is not just bold domestic reforms that must be embraced.
Japan also needs to change how its economy interacts with the world.
Consider the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement.
Completion of both trade and investment deals are among the most urgent tasks we face, because Japan’s economy needs powerful external catalysts to spur change in how we compete at home and for export markets.
Japan has no alternative other than to do everything necessary and feasible to enhance its labor productivity.
We now have the Japanese public’s support to make all of these changes happen.
That support is based on explicit statements of the government’s intentions.
For example, it is now well understood – and approved – by voters that, come April 2017, my government will raise the consumption tax.
Until then, we will no longer be bogged down in debating the merits of this decision.
But we also know that the political space that we have secured is too precious to be squandered.
We must use it single-mindedly to implement reforms that enhance Japan’s long-term growth potential.
Our country’s global standing depends on it.
Over the last two years, I have traveled 354,200 miles, visited a total of 62 countries, and conducted 246 one-on-one meetings with heads of state and other national leaders.
These experiences have convinced me that there is an enormous amount of trust in the world about the path that postwar Japan has taken.
In particular, there is no doubt about the norms and principles that our people and our government have long upheld, such as popular sovereignty, respect for human rights, and peace – all pillars of the Japanese constitution.
Japan has also gained international credibility for the fact that, for seven decades, its diplomacy has not once sought to coerce or intimidate any other country with threats of military force.
Most significant, global trust in Japan reflects the modesty and decorum that countless Japanese have exemplified as they worked to make our economy one of the world’s three largest.
The faith that the world has placed in Japan and its people has been Japanese diplomacy’s most valuable asset.
Our mandate from the Japanese people is to ensure that this tradition continues, undiminished, into the future.
That is the oath I will be making as I assume leadership of Japan for the coming electoral term.
For me and my government, the main task ahead – working even harder to restore Japan’s economy – is inseparable from safeguarding our country’s position in the global vanguard of peace, progress, and prosperity.
