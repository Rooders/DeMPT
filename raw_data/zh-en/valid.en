When Leninists Overreach
MOSCOW – Ongoing street protests in Hong Kong and Moscow have no doubt spooked the authoritarian duo of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Moscow protests, the largest in many years, must be keeping Putin up at night, or they wouldn’t be dispersed with such unabated brutality.
Yet rather than hold a dialogue with the people, Putin has been demonstrating that he is in control, even preening for photos in a tight leather outfit with his favorite motorcycle gang.
Nonetheless, the demonstrations have become a poignant sign of Putin’s declining popularity, including among Russian elites, whose views matter in ways that other forms of public opinion do not.
For two decades, the Russian elite’s rival factions have generally seen Putin as the ultimate guarantor of their interests – particularly their financial interests.
But as Russia’s economy has sunk into sanctions-induced stagnation, Putin’s leadership has started to look like more of a roadblock than a guardrail.
Fewer and fewer Russians still accept that “Putin is Russia and Russia is Putin,” a mantra that one heard regularly just five years ago, following the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea.
Moreover, Putin’s hope that US President Donald Trump would improve relations with Russia has begun to look short-sighted, if not downright delusional.
Although Trump has weakened American institutions and undermined Western alliances, which has played into Putin’s hands, the White House has also rendered US foreign policy utterly unpredictable.
Worse, the Trump administration is now systematically unwinding the arms-control accords that long brought some degree of certainty to nuclear affairs.
Russian elites know that their country is as ill-prepared to win a nuclear-arms race with the United States now as the Soviet Union was in previous decades.
The recent explosion of a nuclear-missile engine at a test site on Russia’s northern Arctic coast is a grim reminder of a deep-seated incompetence.
And unlike Putin, Russian elites are deeply worried that alienating the US will make Russia a de facto vassal state vis-à-vis China.
The protests in Hong Kong, which show no sign of abating, are likewise the product of authoritarian overreach.
They began with a proposed law that would allow Hong Kong citizens and residents to be extradited to the Chinese mainland.
Given how clumsily the legislation was presented by Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, it is possible that the Chinese leadership was only dimly aware of it and its potential political impact.
Nonetheless, the Chinese government’s response to the protests has been increasingly self-defeating.
For starters, the People’s Liberation Army has been openly threatening to intervene to shut down the protests against Lam’s government.
And in cases where pro-government “triad” thugs, most likely based on the mainland, have shown up to assail protesters, the police have been conveniently absent.
As everyone in Hong Kong knows, these extrajudicial beatings had to have been sanctioned by Xi’s government.
More ominously, Xi may have already decided that the time for “one country, two systems” has passed.
China, he might argue, can no longer tolerate a functioning quasi-democracy within its territory, despite the agreement it accepted as a condition of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Concerned about Taiwan and its political drift ever further from the mainland, Xi may be thinking that a harsh Hong Kong policy will scare the Taiwanese into line.
If so, he has forgotten that bullying Taiwan has only ever yielded the opposite of what China intended.
Then again, Xi may be contemplating something even worse.
If he has concluded that Trump’s “America First” administration would do nothing to protect Taiwan, he could be considering a lightning military strike on the island to bring it back under the mainland’s control.
But this, too, would be a mistake.
Given the broader context of Sino-American relations, even the Trump administration would likely respond to Chinese military adventurism in Taiwan.
Besides, the US need not engage in an open military confrontation with China to make aggression toward Taiwan more trouble than it is worth.
The US Navy still has the capacity to cut off the sea lanes supplying energy and minerals to China, regardless of whether it is actively engaged in the South China Sea.
As with Putin, overreach seems to be Xi’s default position nowadays, judging by his handling of the trade war and aggressive behavior toward China’s neighbors.
In fact, Xi’s muscle-flexing has been so heedless that China now finds itself increasingly isolated diplomatically.
Almost all the world’s leading military and economic powers – the European Union, India, Japan, Brazil – maintained pragmatic relations with Xi’s predecessors.
But they have since grown increasingly wary of China, with some even moving closer to the US (in the age of Trump, no less).
As in Russia’s case, China’s elite will no doubt have noticed that Xi is turning the country into an international pariah.
The outside world may assume that China’s senior leadership is as subservient to Xi as the Kremlin is to Putin.
But that is also what many thought about the Soviet politburo and Nikita Khrushchev back in 1964.
Khrushchev was ousted before the end of the year.
There is an old joke in which the long-serving Soviet foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, quips, “We had to remove Khrushchev.
He was so reckless a gambler, we would be lucky to hang on to Moscow if he continued.”
Khrushchev was indeed impulsive when he precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis.
But he was motivated by a desire to maintain military parity with the US.
He did not share the Stalinesque delusions of grandeur that seem to be driving Putin and Xi to wager their own countries’ futures.
Today, no one should assume that either leader will be spared Khrushchev’s fate, or even Stalin’s grim death, which was long rumored to have been perpetrated by his own entourage, whose members had tired of his despotic overreach.

Fighting the "New" Terrorism
As the US presidential heats up, critics argue that President George W. Bush's war in Iraq has made the problem of combating terrorism worse.
It is a serious charge, because the world needs a broader strategy against terrorism.
Terrorism is nothing new, nor is it a single enemy.
It is a longstanding method of conflict frequently defined as deliberate attack on the innocent with the objective of spreading fear.
The attacks on New York and Washington of 2001 were dramatic escalations of an age-old phenomenon.
Terrorism today, however, is different from what it was in the past.
Nowadays, instruments of mass destruction are smaller, cheaper, and more readily available.
Cellular phones were used as timers in the attacks in Madrid last March. Hijacking an airplane is relatively inexpensive.
Finally, the information revolution provides inexpensive means of communication and organization that allow groups once restricted to local and national police jurisdictions to become global.
Al Qaeda is said to have established a network in fifty or more countries.
Changes have also occurred in the motivation and organization of terrorist groups.
Terrorists in the mid-20th century tended to have relatively well-defined political objectives, which were often ill-served by mass murder. Governments supported many covertly.
Toward the century's end, radical groups grew on the fringes of several religions.
Most numerous were the tens of thousands of young Muslims who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, where they were trained in a wide range of techniques and many were recruited to organizations with an extreme view of the religious obligation of jihad .
These technological and ideological trends increased both the lethality and the difficulty of managing terrorism.
Because of the unprecedented scale of Al Qaeda's attacks, the focus is properly on Islamic extremists.
But it would be a mistake to limit our concern solely to Islamic terrorists, for that would ignore the way that technology is putting into the hands of deviant groups and individuals' destructive capabilities that were once limited primarily to governments and armies.
Deviant individuals and groups exist in all human societies, and they are now empowered in ways that were once unthinkable.
Think, for example of Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, or the Aum Shinrykio cult that released poison gas in the Tokyo subway system the same year.
Lethality has been increasing.
In the 1970's, the Palestinian attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and attacks by groups like the Red Brigades galvanized world attention at the cost of dozens of lives.
In the l980's, the worst terrorist incident killed 300 people.
The attacks on America of September 2001 cost several thousand lives.
This escalation occurred without using weapons of mass destruction.
If one imagines a deviant group in some society gaining access to biological or nuclear materials, it is possible terrorists could destroy millions of lives.
To kill so many people in the 20th century, a Hitler or Stalin required the apparatus of a totalitarian government.
It is now easy to envisage extremist groups and individuals killing millions without government help
Politics has plagued efforts to agree on a common definition of terrorism at the United Nations.
Some skeptics argue that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and that treating suppression of terrorism as a global public good is thus merely the hypocrisy of the powerful trying to disarm the weak.
That need not be the case.
Not all struggles for national liberation turn to deliberate killing of innocents.
Deliberate killing of non-combatants (in war or not) is condemned by most major religions, including Islam.
Such behavior is unacceptable whether it is carried out by the powerful or the weak.
While any definition of terrorism has problems at the margins, the core of terrorism is clear enough to permit efforts to de-legitimize it.
Indeed, many countries are parties to UN conventions that commit them to combating aspects of terrorist behavior, even though the UN has not agreed on a single formal definition.
Today, some states harbor terrorists in order to attack their enemies or because they are too weak to control powerful groups.
If a campaign to suppress terrorism is based on broad coalitions that focus on de-legitimizing attacks on innocent non-combatants, it has some prospect of success.
Indeed, one lesson of the efforts since 2001 is that there is no way to avoid broad cooperation.
In that sense, the metaphor of war - with its emphasis on military force is - misleading.
The metaphor of war was understandable in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, but creates as many problems as it solves.
How long will the war last and how does it relate to civil liberties and alliances?
Bombing is not an option for fighting terrorist cells in Hamburg, Singapore, or Detroit.
Only close civilian cooperation in intelligence sharing, police work across borders, tracing financial flows, and working to pre-clear cargo manifests and passenger lists can cope with such a threat.
Countries cooperate out of self-interest, but a country's soft or attractive power, not only its military might, affects the degree of cooperation.
That is why critics argue that Bush's policy in Iraq was a mistake.
It squandered American soft power, diverted attention from Afghanistan and Al Qaeda, and created a danger that Iraq may become a haven for terrorists.
But critics of Bush at home and abroad must also realize that, notwithstanding past mistakes, pursuing a common strategy is essential, because terrorism is here to stay.

Make Your Own Silicon Valley
SEATTLE – California may be the world’s largest and best-known technology hub, but it is not alone in fostering innovative startups.
In fact, such firms are emerging – almost unnoticed – everywhere, from Asian megalopolises like Singapore and Shanghai to small European cities like Espoo in Finland and Dwingeloo in the Netherlands.
Many international startups – including Sweden’s Spotify, Estonia’s Skype, Israel’s Waze – and, most recently, China’s Alibaba – have gained billion-dollar valuations.
Clearly, the key features of Silicon Valley that foster innovation and entrepreneurship – a dense concentration of human talent, a competitive spirit, easy access to capital, and a supportive regulatory environment – can be replicated in and adapted to a wide variety of contexts.
Indeed, these pillars of creativity and progress have been erected even in countries whose economies, politics, and cultures diverge sharply from those of the United States.
Of course, not every country approaches innovation in the same way.
Finland, for example, owes its dynamic computer-games cluster largely to a student-driven movement in higher education.
Though Rovio Entertainment’s release in 2009 of the popular video game Angry Birds catalyzed an innovation boom in Espoo, it is Aalto University – Finland’s equivalent of Stanford in California – that continues to fuel innovation in the area, by nurturing programmers, designers, and others with the necessary talents.
Aalto students also have launched Europe’s most dynamic startup conference, which will bring together more than 10,000 entrepreneurs and financiers this November.
Moreover, the university’s Startup Sauna seed-accelerator program helps promising early-stage startups take their first steps toward success.
Located on campus, the program’s facilities resemble colorful Google offices, but with a Finnish twist: video conference rooms have been built into sauna-like structures.
Since its establishment in 2010, 126 companies have graduated from Startup Sauna, having raised more than $37 million in funding.
Today, Finland boasts more than 200 gaming startups, which export 90% of their products.
According to Aalto, Finland’s gaming sector experienced 260% revenue growth in 2012-2013, adding 1,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in total value to the Finnish economy just last year.
In the Netherlands, the government has taken the lead in promoting innovative activities.
Two and a half years ago, the Dutch government teamed up with IBM and a group of small and medium-size local businesses to jumpstart a big-data hub in the far-northern village of Dwingeloo, home to the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.
Like Silicon Valley-based initiatives, the project unites academia, talent-rich local companies, and multinationals behind a common goal – in this case, to build the world’s largest radio telescope.
The device will process and analyze radioactive waves collected from two million individual antennae, enabling researchers to map the shape of the universe by (they hope) 2020.
IBM provides the processing power for the data, while local Dutch companies are building all of the components.
Beyond its own specific objectives, the initiative can help to catalyze a broader transformation of the Dutch tech culture.
Jan de Jeu, Vice President of the University of Groningen, anticipates experts in Dwingeloo and the northern Netherlands training more scientists and IT specialists in the fundamental challenges related to the storage, transfer, and analysis of enormous data sets, thereby creating what de Jeu calls “The Data Industry Valley.”
In Southeast Asia, Hong Kong benefits, first and foremost, from a business culture that is unencumbered by either red tape or corruption.
It takes about two days to set up a new business; taxes are low; and ample co-working spaces are available.
Furthermore, the government-funded Cyberport Incubation Program supports the development of Hong Kong’s information and communications technology industry by providing companies with start-up capital, access to advanced facilities, and training in entrepreneurship, technology, and business development.
As a result, the number of entrepreneurs has grown by 300% in the last three years.
For its part, Singapore is increasingly seeing the effects of a decade of regulatory reforms, including government grants and tax incentives to encourage foreign investment in the technology sector.
In 2002-2009, more than 11,000 startups were established.
Singapore’s social-media startup Bubble Motion (recently rebranded as Bubbly) generated more than 20 million users in its first two years – nearly double the number that Facebook or Twitter accrued in the same period in their history.
It counts influential Silicon Valley firms such as Sequoia Capital, Northgate Capital, and Comcast Ventures as investors.
On mainland China, Alibaba recently made history by raising $25 billion in the world’s largest initial public offering to date.
Company founder Jack Ma said that his ambition is to create a thriving “ecosystem” around the corporate headquarters in Hangzhou.
Alibaba employees, ex-employees, and stockholders already injected more than $6 billion in the local economy in 2013, with Zhejiang University and the Fudi Startup Incubator Centers (founded by a former Alibaba employee) encouraging frenetic startup activity.
California’s enclave of tech companies remains the crown jewel of entrepreneurial ecosystems.
But international innovators are increasingly recognizing that, as valuations in Silicon Valley soar, the real bargains for tech-savvy investors may be found outside of the US.

Corrupting the Fight Against Corruption
At its recent annual meeting, World Bank officials spoke extensively about corruption.
It is an understandable concern: money that the Bank lends to developing countries that ends up in secret bank accounts or finances some contractors’ luxurious lifestyle leaves a country more indebted, not more prosperous.
James Wolfensohn, the Bank’s previous president, and I are widely credited with putting corruption on the Bank’s agenda, against opponents who regarded corruption as a political issue, not an economic one, and thus outside the Bank’s mandate.
Our research showed systematic relationships between corruption and economic growth, which allowed us to pursue this critical issue.
But the World Bank would do well to keep four things in mind as it takes up the fight.
First, corruption takes many forms, so a war on corruption has to be fought on many fronts.
You can’t fight the diversion of small amounts of money by weak and poor countries while ignoring the massive diversion of public resources into private hands of the sort that marked, say, Russia under Boris Yeltsin.
In some countries, overt corruption occurs primarily through campaign contributions that oblige politicians to repay major donors with favors.
Smaller-scale corruption is bad, but systemic corruption of political processes can have even greater costs.
Campaign contributions and lobbying that lead to rapid privatizations of utilities – before appropriate regulatory frameworks are in place, and in a manner that produces only a few bidders – can impede development, even without direct kickbacks to government officials.
Life is never black and white.
Just as there is no “one size fits all” policy for economic development, there is no such policy for fighting corruption.
The response to corruption needs to be as complex and variegated as corruption itself.
Second, it’s fine for the World Bank to deliver anti-corruption sermons.
But policies, procedures, and institutions are what matter.
In fact, the Bank’s procurement procedures are generally viewed around the world as a model to be admired.
Indeed, some countries with large dollar reserves – hardly in need of World Bank credit – borrowed from the Bank at far higher interest rates than they were getting from the United States, believing that these procedures would help ensure high-quality projects free of corruption and become standard in other areas.
But success in fighting corruption entails more than just good procurement procedures (avoiding, for instance, single-source non-competitive bidding).
Many other policies and procedures can be enacted that reduce incentives for corruption.
For example, some tax systems are more corruption-resistant than others, because they curtail the discretionary authority of tax officials.
Third, the World Bank’s primary responsibility is to fight poverty, which means that when it confronts a poor country plagued with corruption, its challenge is to figure out how to ensure that its own money is not tainted and gets to projects and people that need it.
In some cases, this may entail delivering assistance through non-governmental organizations.
But seldom will it be the case that the best response is simply to walk away.
Finally, while developing countries must take responsibility for rooting out corruption, there is much that the West can do to help.
At a minimum, Western governments and corporations should not be complicit.
Every bribe that is taken has a payer, and too often the bribe payer is a corporation from an advanced industrial country or someone acting on its behalf.
Indeed, one reason for the so called “natural resource curse” ­– the fact that resource-rich countries do not, on average, do as well as resource-poor countries – is the prevalence of corruption, too often aided and abetted by companies that would like to get the resources they sell at discount prices.
The US under President Jimmy Carter made an important contribution in passing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which made bribery by American companies anywhere in the world illegal.
The OECD’s Convention on Bribery was another step in the right direction.
Making all payments to governments transparent would bring further progress, and Western governments could encourage this simply by tying this requirement to tax deductibility.
It is equally important to address bank secrecy, which facilitates corruption by providing corrupt dictators with a safe haven for their funds.
In August 2001, just before the terrorist attacks on America, the US government vetoed an OECD effort to limit secret bank accounts.
While the government has since reversed its stance on bank secrecy for terrorists, it has not done so for corrupt officials.
A strong stand by the World Bank would enhance its credibility in the war on corruption.
Those who criticize the Bank’s stance on corruption do not do so because they favor corruption.
Some critics worry about corruption in the corruption agenda itself: that the fight will be used as a “cover” for cutting aid to countries that displease the US administration.
Such concerns have found resonance in the seeming incongruity of the Bank’s tough talk on corruption and simultaneous plans to expand lending to Iraq.
No one is likely to certify that Iraq is corruption-free – or even ranks low on corruption internationally.
The most strident criticism, however, comes from those who worry that the World Bank is straying from its mandate.
Of course, the Bank must do everything that it can to ensure that its money is well spent, which means fighting both corruption and incompetence.
But money itself will not solve all problems, and a single-minded focus on fighting corruption will not bring development.
On the contrary, it might merely divert attention from other issues of no less moment for those struggling to lift themselves out of poverty.

Getting Serious in Russia's War on Terror
Russia's decision to spend an extra 157 billion rubles (over $5 billion) to fight terrorism is a more impressive response than all the Kremlin's recent tough talk, including President Vladimir Putin's demand that more power be centralized in his hands.
Indeed, after the hostage crisis in the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in 2002, the same sort of harsh words flowed, but no extra money was spent.
These new billions do seem to demonstrate renewed government resolve, but is throwing money at the war on terror enough?
The Kremlin refuses to publicly admit that today's terrorism has its roots predominantly in the Chechen war, which is now metastasizing throughout the Northern Caucasus.
Chechen fighters and their supporters demonstrate almost daily that the war continues, and countless bold pronouncements, like newly elected Chechen president Alu Alkhanov's recent assertion that "effective measures" have been found to combat terror, look like mere bloviation.
According to Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin, huge amounts of money are needed to resolve the Chechen problem.
But financial inflows into Chechnya are often more destabilizing than helpful.
President Akhmat Kadyrov, the murdered Chechen president, was right to suggest that 80% of this money ends up in the pockets of Moscow and regional firms who benefit from the Chechen conflict continuing.
So neither money nor military power alone can end the bloodshed, and diplomacy with the less militant Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov seems unlikely, for three reasons.
First, contacts between Maskhadov and a few Russian politicians haven't - at least as of yet - influenced the Kremlin's position.
Second, the subject for negotiations is unclear, because Putin has ruled out Chechen independence, and surrender by the separatists is just as unlikely.
Third, even if negotiations with less militant Chechens occur and succeed, terrorism will continue under the leadership of the religious fanatic Shamil Basaev.
The result of all this is spreading hopelessness.
The thirst for vengeance after the Beslan school massacre makes confrontation between Chechens and Ingushis increasingly possible.
Chechnya's neighboring republic, Dagestan, is witnessing increasing confrontations between radical and traditional Islamic groups, something now also seen in Kabardino-Balkaria.
Unless the Russian state develops a viable policy, fast, all of these areas threaten to become safe havens for terrorists.
What Russia needs is a political response to terror that takes into account its international dimension.
In the last four years, radical Islam has established itself in the Northern Caucasus.
This doesn't mean that all local Muslims have become jihadis.
In fact, the latter are a tiny minority.
But they are energetic, mobilized, and experienced fighters.
These people increasingly identify themselves with the global jihad, and have forged firm links with Muslim radicals in the Middle East, Southern Asia and Europe.
Russia must now follow America's lead in how to fight terror.
Since the attacks of September 2001, the United States has managed to avoid further attacks on its land.
True, the news coming from Iraq is horrible, but the US is fighting a full-blown war in Iraq; it is not engaged in a counterterrorist operation.
Russia's power structures, like those of America, must now be readied to conduct a very long struggle, entirely different from the old Soviet KGB way of suppressing dissent.
Russia's security forces need to learn to be pro-active, because the terrorists consistently seek to perfect their deadly methods.
The fight against terror turns on who will strike first; so far, the terrorists have been faster and more professional than the Russian state.
To conduct this struggle effectively, Russia must abandon two hoary stereotypes: that all terrorists are bandits, and that they somehow are acting under some Western intelligence supervision to weaken Russia.
The base of world terrorism consists of daring fanatics who believe in a sacred, fiery destiny.
Osama bin Laden doesn't work for money and wants to destroy the entire West, not weaken Russia in particular.
But the greatest obstacle that must be confronted if Russia is to wage war on terror effectively is the rampant corruption in the security forces.
It is well known, for example, that Basaev's fanatical killers paid off Russian militia to enter Budeonovsk in 1995 and kill hospital patients.
Yet nothing has been done to root out this tool of terror.
It is all too easy to reduce the fight against terrorism to tightening the political screws, to a strengthening of Putin's power, to restricting the movement of people within the country.
But none of these measures will frighten extremists in the Northern Caucasus or their al Qaeda allies.
The Kremlin must know this already.
Even Putin's predictable presidential rhetoric reveals a desire to initiate a real fight against terrorism.
But waging a serious war requires a serious reorganization of Russia's power structures, which will be very painful.
Despite Putin's so far unsuccessful fight against terrorism, his popularity remains high, so he has the political capital to make tough internal reforms.
But he must act now, for public support can be no substitute for resolute and effective action.

The Greening of China
Two countries – the United States and China – remain aloof from global efforts to create a new post-Kyoto framework on climate change.
Fifty years ago, the rest of the world might have carried on with remedying the problem of conventional and greenhouse gas emissions and let China and the US stew in their own waste.
But the world is now so interdependent that what happens in one place affects all others.
For example, visitors and residents alike have long thought of Hong Kong as a beautiful city clinging to the South China coast.
But, for at least five years, Hong Kong’s citizens have found themselves starting to cough and wheeze from the city’s increasingly degraded air.
Corporate employers are even complaining about not being able to attract overseas talent.
Pollution from Hong Kong’s own power generation plants, growing number of vehicles, and burgeoning shipping industry can certainly be reduced.
But the lion’s share of this industrial haze – like the growing pollution of its coastal waters – is a direct result of the rapid industrialization of the Pearl River Delta across the border in China’s Guangdong Province.
China is exporting not only more and more goods, but also its environmental degradation.
The inescapable truth is that the futures of Hong Kong and China are integrally linked.
There are roughly 58,000 factories in the Pearl River Delta with Hong Kong connections, and together they employ more than 10 million workers.
Guangdong accounts for about 30% of China’s total foreign trade, while Hong Kong is China’s international finance center.
Officials in both Hong Kong and Guangdong are powerless to clean up their environmental problems on their own.
In fact, development plans in China may be heading in the opposite direction.
Political heavyweights in Guangdong still favor a form of development that relies on speed and quantity while ignoring overall environmental quality.
And Hong Kong’s economic blueprint also focuses on accelerating large infrastructure projects whose environmental impact has not been rigorously examined.
It will not be easy for leaders on either side of the border to reverse gears, but there is still chance that people and companies can make a difference.
Increasingly loud complaints about deteriorating air quality have goaded Hong Kong and Guangdong into embarking on a joint program in which a series of monitoring stations now provides emissions data.
Hong Kong’s data have been released regularly, and in 2006, Guangdong’s data were made publicly available for the first time.
There is now also talk about monitoring water quality.
These are laudable steps for China, given its poor record on transparency.
Indeed, the joint air-monitoring network provides a foundation for the region to develop a sophisticated regional air management program.
Furthermore, new coal-fired power plants may no longer be allowed on either side of the border, necessitating greater use of natural gas and renewable energy sources.
The first challenge for authorities is to regulate power generation very differently.
People are used to paying for the electricity that they actually use.
But, to optimize efficiency, utilities need to be rewarded for what they help consumers save.
In other words, utilities must be given incentives to help consumers use less power.
This idea is clearly feasible.
Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed what he calls the “negawatt,” or energy that is never used.
All that is needed are the right financial incentives to induce utility companies to produce less electricity (and still be more profitable) and consumers to reduce their use (and gain savings without sacrificing comfort).
This can be done by refitting households with high-efficiency light bulbs and other technological improvements, and by retrofitting industrial plants with energy-saving technologies.
Another innovative idea that Hong Kong and Guangdong are exploring is the “P2E2” scheme.
To help industries in the region upgrade environmentally, firms can now obtain special loans for which the Asian Development Bank assumes the risk – a program made possible by Hong Kong’s sound banking practices.
Another initiative worth watching is the Hong Kong stock exchange’s exploratory project to offer a trading platform for emissions derivatives, which will most likely include conventional pollutants as well as carbon.
The exchange will undertake a study this summer, with trading to begin as early as 2008.
If these reforms are not trumped by efforts to maintain high growth at all costs, the region could not only clean itself up while continuing to prosper, but could also establish a model for all of China.
Nothing is more necessary in a country that, according to the United Nations Development Program, contains 16 of the world’s 20 most polluted cities.
Hong Kong’s leaders to do not want to end up on that infamous list.
By saving themselves, they may also be able to play an instrumental role in saving China.

Will Economic Illiteracy Trigger a Trade War?
NEW YORK – Nearly 100 days after US President Donald Trump took office, he and his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, continue to commit an economic fallacy that first-year economics students learn to avoid.
They claim that America’s current-account deficit (or trade deficit), which is in fact the result of America’s low and falling saving rate, is an indicator of unfair trade practices by Germany and China, two current-account surplus countries.
Their embrace of economic ignorance could lead to disaster.
The current-account balance, measuring the balance of trade in goods, services, net factor income, and transfer payments from abroad, is equal to national saving minus domestic investment.
That’s not a theory. It’s an identity, save for any statistical discrepancy between gross national product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI).
It’s true whether you are liberal or conservative, populist or mainstream, a Keynesian or a supply-sider.
Even Trump and all his deal making can’t change that.
Yet he is threatening a trade war because of deficits that reflect America’s own saving-investment imbalance.
A country runs a current-account deficit if investment exceeds national saving, and runs a surplus when investment is less than national saving.
For a country with a balanced current account, a deficit can arise if its investment rate rises, its saving rate falls, or some combination of the two occurs.
Suppose that the US is trading with foreign countries that maintain protectionist policies.
If these countries liberalize their trade regimes, they will tend to import more US goods that compete with their own industries. The size of the import-competing sectors will then shrink, freeing up workers and capital to increase output in export sectors.
As exports rise, so will the foreign-exchange earnings that pay for the higher import bill.
Suppose, conversely, that the US imposes new import barriers in response to its current-account deficit.
These import barriers would pull workers and capital into import-competing sectors and away from export sectors, roughly leaving the US trade balance unchanged while lowering national income and average living standards.
The trade deficit could fall if the import barriers were in the form of trade taxes that lowered the budget deficit (thereby raising government saving) but that effect would work through the budget, not through trade policy per se.
There is no particular reason why a reduction of foreign trade barriers or an increase in US trade barriers would have any first-order effects on the US saving and investment rates, and therefore on the US current-account balance.
To reduce its current-account deficit, the US must either save more or invest less in its economy.
It’s not hard to see why the US runs chronic current-account deficits.
The US national saving rate – the sum of private saving plus government saving, measured as a share of GNI – has declined markedly during the past 30 years.
Most of the decline in the US saving rate is due to a decline in the government saving rate.
Government in the US (federal, state, and local) is a net dis-saver, meaning that current outlays (for consumption, interest payments on the public debt, and transfers) exceed revenues, currently by around 2% of GNI.
This is not surprising.
The lion’s share of the problem is at the federal level.
Every president since Ronald Reagan has promised “middle-class tax cuts” and other tax breaks, undermining revenues and leaving the federal budget in chronic deficit.
Democratic presidents favor the supposed Keynesian “stimulus” of tax cuts, while Republicans champion their alleged “supply-side” effects.
Both the Democratic and Republican parties are practitioners of populism, American-style: they repeatedly cut taxes, increase the public debt (which doubled from 35% of GDP in 2007 to 74% of GDP at the end of 2015), and generally blame somebody else for the slow US growth that arises from low saving and investment rates.
Now it’s the turn of China and Germany to be in US leaders’ crosshairs.
America’s trade and budget imbalances could soon get a lot worse if Trump and congressional Republicans get their way in cutting federal taxes still further.
This would be a ruinous fiscal policy, yet perhaps a popular one in the short term – before the economic bills start coming due. With a larger budget deficit, America’s current-account deficit would soar as well, just as it did when Reagan’s tax cuts expanded the federal budget deficit sharply in the early 1980s.
One can imagine that the rising trade deficit would then lead to even more outlandish claims by Trump and his officials about alleged Chinese and German trade perfidy.
Americans should not allow themselves to be fooled.
The emperor has no clothes, imported or domestic; and, apparently, he has no competent economic advisers, either.

How to Use Economic Sanctions Wisely
WASHINGTON, DC – To help Ukraine while avoiding a nuclear confrontation between NATO and Russia, the United States and its allies have attacked the Russian economy with trade and financial sanctions on a previously unimaginable scale.
But is it the right scale, and are these the right sanctions?
Trade sanctions are prohibitions on exports, imports, or other international transactions – including airline landing rights, asset sales, shipping rights, and port privileges – with a targeted country.
Blockades are a well-known wartime sanction, but countries employ sanctions in peacetime as well.
The idea is to coerce the targeted country to alter its behavior, by preventing it from enjoying the benefits of exchange with the rest of the world.
The use of sanctions intensified after World War I, when governments, led by US President Woodrow Wilson’s administration, agreed to address international disputes through economic measures instead of military action.
This preference for sanctions over violent conflict resumed after World War II and has become more entrenched ever since.
By 2020, the US had imposed sanctions on more than 10,000 entities – ten times as many as in 2000 – many of them connected to North Korea, Cuba, and Iran.
These measures have largely come in the form of prohibitions (or limitations) on trade with the target country.
Sanctions differ from tariffs.
Whereas tariffs are usually intended to influence output and employment in the country that imposes them, sanctions’ primary purpose is to change another country’s behavior through the coercive power of economic hardship.
Historically, sanctions have had only limited success, and their effectiveness has varied widely depending on underlying conditions.
When other countries refrain from participating in sanctions, the target country can evade a sanctions regime by doing business with, or arranging transshipment through, the holdouts.
Until 1991, the Soviet Union regularly played this role by continuing to trade with United Nations-sanctioned countries.
Moreover, new smuggling methods and other means of sanctions evasion have emerged over time, making enforcement a constant challenge.
The longer sanctions are in place, the more ways businesses and others will find to evade them.
The situation changed in the 1990s, when the UN Security Council started endorsing sweeping sanctions against specific countries.
In 1990, it imposed a financial and trade embargo on Iraq in response to its invasion of Kuwait.
US sanctions barred American companies from all transactions with entities in Iraq, and additional “secondary sanctions” targeted any activity with companies continuing to do business with Iraq, as well as goods or services with components made in Iraq.
Such primary and secondary sanctions can be highly costly for targeted countries, but they have not persuaded governments in Cuba, Venezuela, or North Korea to change their ways.
When Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, US President Joe Biden’s administration announced harsh sanctions on trade with Russia, along with unprecedented financial prohibitions, and most other countries took similar measures.
For example, Russian banks have been excluded from the SWIFT financial messaging system for international payments.
As a result, Russians cannot use their reserves, receive payments for most exports, or pay for their imports in anything other than rubles or through another payments system.
The effects of these sanctions have been sweeping.
Although China has been building its own Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), SWIFT still handles the vast bulk of international payments today.
Amiyatosh Purnanandam of the University of Michigan has described the barring of Russian banks as “a nonviolent nuclear attack on Russia’s economic system.”
In response, Russia has been seeking other channels to receive and make payments.
For example, Russia has been pressuring India for a rupees-for-rubles arrangement under which it can export oil in exchange for other goods.
But the true extent of the damage to the Russian economy will depend in large part on the European Union, Russia’s largest trading partner.
If Europeans stopped importing oil and gas from Russia, the harm to Russia’s economy would be rapid and severe.
The problem, of course, is that an energy boycott would entail extreme hardship for Europe as well.
Although the US and other countries could help soften the blow, they probably could not make up for the reduction in supply.
Moreover, a significant reduction in Russian oil and gas exports to the EU would result in sudden dramatic increases in hydrocarbon prices globally, hitting all energy-importing countries.
While the horrors of the Russian invasion have induced strong public support for sanctions, the question is how long the sanctions can usefully stay in place.
The longer they are in place, the greater the risks to the international financial system.
As Russia seeks alternative trading and financing patterns, and as other countries start to worry more about their own exposure to potential US sanctions, the SWIFT system will be undercut.
If the sanctions regime is relatively short-lived, the hit to SWIFT could be contained.
But if China accelerates its CIPS development, the longer-term consequences for the international financial system would be more significant.
Countries that support an open international trade and payments system should recognize these longer-term risks and take whatever measures they can to limit the duration of and fallout from financial sanctions.
They can start by supporting the multilateral cooperation and coordination needed to ensure that the sanctions against Russia succeed.
But they should also make a firm commitment to increase the supply of oil and gas to EU countries in the meantime, and to remove the sanctions when hostilities end.

The Soft Underbelly of China’s Growth
China’s explosive economic growth hinges on the rest of the world, radically changing the global production chain and challenging the global trading system.
If China maintains its growth momentum over the next two decades, the global system will face huge challenges.
Indeed, the question is not so much whether the global system will endure the imbalances spawned by China, but how severe those imbalances will prove to be.
Much of the concern over the past few years has centered on America’s yawning current account and fiscal deficits, and its effort to get China to let the yuan float more freely against the dollar.
China, by contrast, sees its growth as tied to a stable currency, and may not want to introduce a more flexible exchange-rate regime, even after the 2.1% revaluation in July, pending alleviation of structural problems for which it is extremely difficult to set a timetable.
In fact, even as China’s economy has boomed over the past decade, structural adjustment in its domestic sectors slowed, mainly owing to political constraints.
The banking system remains unhealthy and fragile; capital markets are dying.
The private sector’s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes.
Mounting regional disparities, as well as the widening urban-rural divide, impede household consumption growth, increasing the economy’s dependence on exports and foreign investment.
For years, as optimists see it, China has been the world’s cheap assembly shop for shoes, clothing, and microwave ovens.
Now, it is laying the groundwork to become a global power in more sophisticated, technology-intensive industries.
Billions of dollars are flowing into auto, steel, chemical, and high-tech electronics plants, setting the stage for China to be a major exporter of high-end products.
While this argument suggests that the global trading system must make more room for a rising China (and India), it overlooks the need to address the enormous structural problems in China’s domestic sectors if export-led growth is to become sustainable.
For these sectors, rapid investment-driven growth in the past decade has produced a mountain of excess capacity, reflected in stagnant prices and the banking sector’s soaring volume of bad loans, as price wars squeeze profitability and stimulate real-estate speculation.
Postponing structural reforms eventually constrains any economy’s performance, as we saw in Japan in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
China has similar problems, with the investment-growth nexus threatening macroeconomic stability – witness the overheating that occurred in 2003 and 2004.
Indeed, China faces tremendous challenges in maintaining macroeconomic stability under conditions of export-led growth, with huge repercussions for the rest of the world.
Given China’s size and its rising share in the global market, macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials.
But the political reality is that China’s government favors rapid growth in the short run over the structural reforms needed to sustain long-term economic performance.
Fiscal consolidation and the abrupt closure and restructuring of inefficient banks and state enterprises would, after all, constitute a powerful brake on short-term growth, threatening social peace and political stability.
This may explain the growing efforts of Chinese businesses in recent years to go global themselves.
Globalization is increasingly viewed as an alternative to domestic structural complexity.
This strategy will exact a heavy price, just as it did in Japan twenty years ago.
The main lesson of Japan’s approach is that launching an aggressive buying spree overseas merely upsets established international balances of interests – thus generating greater tensions with the rest of the world – while hiding the seriousness of structural problems at home.
China has much to gain by avoiding such a strategy.
Focusing squarely on structural reforms would allay some of the fears that China’s rise has inspired in the rest of the world, while winning praise from the international business community.
Rather than scaring global corporations and their home states, China would retain strong political support abroad – and the financing that it needs for its continued development.
In economic terms, China has no choice: it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two.
Above all, truly secure and sustainable economic development requires that it build a large consumer base at home.
Of course, the global imbalances associated with China’s economic rise can take longer to adjust than they otherwise would, simply because the US welcomes it as being in America’s own interest.
But China’s long-term interest, and that of the world, requires that it get serious about domestic structural reform.

China’s Next Agenda
CAMBRIDGE – I recently returned from Beijing, where I had spent a week talking with Chinese officials and attending the China Development Forum (CDF), the major annual gathering of Chinese and senior foreign officials and top business executives.
The Chinese government had just released its 13th Five-Year Plan, and officials were eager to explain what it means for China’s future.
Although the latest plan contains a seemingly endless list of specific projects and goals, the major new theme this year is “supply-side restructuring,” a term that includes a wide range of policies aimed at boosting economic growth and living standards.
The term “supply side” is intended to distinguish these new policies from the traditional demand-side measures of easy money and a slightly larger fiscal deficit that are already aimed at strengthening economic activity.
High on the list of supply-side policies is eliminating some of the excess capacity of state-owned firms in the steel and coal industries.
This means shedding some four million workers, a number equal to about 0.5% of China’s workforce.
The plan authorizes a special fund to provide assistance to those who remain unemployed.
Experts believe that much more downsizing is needed; but the authorities are starting small to see how it works and to monitor the public’s response.
China will also be shifting millions of people from low-productivity agricultural areas to dozens of new cities, accompanied by ambitious plans to build 50 new airports and thousands of miles of new roads and railroads.
The authorities also tout the One Belt, One Road project, which will use Chinese financial assistance and resources to develop ports, railroads, and highways linking China with other parts of Asia, central Asia, and potentially even Europe.
The foreign-policy goal is to expand Chinese influence in the region and beyond.
It will also provide an opportunity to export some of China’s excess industrial capacity.
Moreover, officials intend to stimulate innovation through research and development, including by lowering tax rates for high-technology firms.
Tax reform will also extend China’s value-added tax to the service sector.
And financial reforms will eliminate the limits on interest rates that banks can pay on deposits and charge on loans.
At the same time, there is substantial confusion about China’s new foreign-exchange regime.
In recent years, the renminbi’s decline relative to the dollar has prompted complaints from American firms that compete with Chinese products.
But the renminbi has also strengthened by 25% relative to other advanced-country currencies since 2010.
The authorities promise to allow the market to determine the exchange rate, and that there is no reason for a sustained decline.
But officials continue to report the renminbi’s movements relative to the dollar because they fear that emphasizing exchange-rate management relative to a currency basket will suggest further decline relative to the dollar, an expectation that would increase capital outflows.
Policies to improve the environment are also high on the government’s agenda for the next five years.
The public is eager for cleaner air, rivers, and land.
To achieve this, the government will adopt new regulations and create “green bonds” to finance remediation and low-carbon energy sources.
Chinese auto firms are being encouraged to produce hybrid cars, and the government is warning foreign auto companies that it will take steps to reduce their market share if they don’t conform.
Improving the quality of life also requires boosting the quality of products that Chinese consumers can buy.
One government minister at the CDF noted that the one million Chinese tourists who went abroad last year used their credit cards to buy about $1 billion worth of goods that they cannot obtain at home (while noting the irony that some of those European and American branded goods are actually manufactured in China).
China is still a low-income country, with per capita GDP of just $14,000, about one fourth of that in the United States.
Although Beijing and Shanghai are relatively prosperous, there is still much poverty.
It is revealing that to achieve the Five-Year Plan’s goal of eliminating poverty by 2020, which requires reducing the number of poor people by 55 million, the poverty line is defined as just $354 a year, or less than one dollar a day.
Chinese corporations’ high level of debt could be a source of financial instability, although several officials stressed that they were not worried.
Government data show that the ratio of bank loans to GDP is about twice that of the United States.
More worrying, the share of nonperforming loans may be dangerously high.
But even if that share is higher than official statistics indicate, China’s bad-debt problem is very different from that of the West.
China’s largest corporate debtors are state-owned firms, and their creditors are state-owned banks.
So resolving the bad debts would involve transferring the losses from the state-owned banks to the government.
And, because the government debt is relatively low – about 17% of GDP – it would not be difficult for the government to absorb these losses.
If necessary, it could also deal with the excess debts that local governments, encouraged by the central authorities, incurred in 2008 and 2009.
What was not discussed at the CDF is the major crackdown on high-level corruption that President Xi Jinping is pursuing and that many say is impeding economic decision-making and slowing GDP growth.
Nor was there any discussion of the widespread concern about an ideological shift to the left that could threaten property rights, leading to capital flight as individuals seek to protect their wealth.
But while China remains a complicated puzzle, the authorities are clearly pursuing pro-market reforms designed to produce real annual growth of 6.5% or more during the next five years, leading to the doubling of real per capita income by 2020 that the Chinese Communist Party called for in 2010.
If that target is missed, it will not be for a lack of effort on the part of the Chinese government.

A Little Geopolitics Is a Dangerous Thing
PRINCETON – Any hope that Donald Trump’s messy departure from the White House would at least restore a modicum of calm to the world must now be discounted.
Already, there is a dangerous new international threat: the return of “geopolitics” in shaping international security.
Consider the events of the past six months.
Within weeks of President Joe Biden’s inauguration, his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, got into an extraordinary spat with his Chinese counterpart at a bilateral meeting in Alaska.
The United States has also tussled with the European Union over Nord Stream 2, a pipeline that will deliver Russian natural gas directly to Germany, bypassing (and thus weakening) Ukraine.
And, for its part, the EU imposed tougher sanctions on China, citing its policies in Xinjiang, to which China responded with sanctions of its own.
Then, in June, a naval contretemps between Russia and Britain in the Black Sea evoked parallels to the 1850s Crimean War.
And a meeting between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin did little to reduce US-Russian tensions.
When it comes, Biden’s first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to be any warmer.
The G7 is rebranding itself as a club of rich democracies that will set “basic rules of the road” for the rest of the world.
Never mind that other powerful countries have no interest in rules set by someone else.
“Geopolitics” is the word most used to describe these developments, most of which are framed as new iterations of old issues.
Russia, for example, is said to be continuing the Soviet tradition of using energy exports to induce dependency in others.
Hence, Nord Stream 2 reprises President Ronald Reagan’s struggle over German participation in the construction of a Soviet pipeline four decades ago.
Blinken calls it a “Russian geopolitical project to divide Europe.”
A classically ambiguous concept, geopolitics has both innocent and perilous uses.
For some, it promotes a vague sense of geographical contingency. For others, however, it amounts to geographical determinism, implying an endless conflict in which space matters more than ideas, maps more than chaps.
The term’s danger lies in its inherent nihilism: it leads us to assume that no one can be seriously interested in values, because there can be no universal good.
After World War I and the failure of a dangerously ambitious German vision of “world politics” (Weltpolitik) under Kaiser Wilhelm II, a new term was needed.
It was supplied by Karl Haushofer, an officer and strategic theorist at the Munich Military Academy, who had been deeply influenced by a relatively brief spell as a military attaché in Tokyo.
The word Geopolitik had been coined by a Swedish politician, Johan Rudolf Kjellén, in 1900, and Haushofer adopted it with relish.
It was Haushofer who first conflated geography with necessary conflict, making all international politics into a bitter but inevitable zero-sum struggle between haves and have-nots.
He believed it was his mission to create a new political science – “the science of the political life form in a natural living space.”
Geopolitics was the doctrine of the “earth-connectedness of political processes,” and must ultimately “become the conscience of the state.”
Starting in the 1920s, Haushofer rapidly acquired admirers from the marginalized elements of the international order.
Adolf Hitler may well have been influenced by his thinking; he dictated Mein Kampf through the Haushofer disciple Rudolf Hess.
Karl Radek, the secretary of the Comintern, was certainly impressed (there was even a Soviet journal of geopolitics).
And geopolitical thinking has since returned with a vengeance to Russian politics, following the humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union.
Haushofer has been enthusiastically embraced by Aleksandr Dugin, a quasi-fascist strategic analyst who is widely believed to have influenced Putin’s worldview.
There is a common pattern here: geopolitics tends to be the favored term for historical losers who want to give a cynical twist to their efforts to dismantle a victorious intellectual project.
This was not what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meant in 2019, when she declared that she would lead a “geopolitical Commission.”
The point was to distinguish the new Commission from a “political” one that would interfere in EU member states’ internal affairs, and the term seemed to suggest that Europe would engage openly with others.
In a globalized world, many Europeans thought that Europe writ large needed a voice, and they were sympathetic to the argument that even large member states like France, Germany, or Italy could not be influential on their own.
But under current circumstances, geopolitical posturing once again looks like compensation for impotence.
The bad symptoms associated with the old geopolitics are reappearing and hampering solutions to global problems like the COVID-19 pandemic, which will not end until there is universal vaccination.
Using “geopolitics” promiscuously achieves nothing, because invoking the term is no substitute for substantive discussions and an airing of conflicting interpretations.
Thinking in terms of great-power clashes, and sparring over who is the bigger hypocrite, will neither resolve international disagreements nor solve common problems.
The only way to do that is to focus on what achieving common goals actually requires.

An Answer to the Russian Challenge
BERLIN – For 19 years, the West (America and Europe) has been putting off answering a critical strategic question: what role should post-Soviet Russia actually play globally and in the European order?
Should it be treated as a difficult partner or a strategic adversary?
Even when this choice became critically acute during the crisis of Russia’s short war against Georgia last summer, the West didn’t provide a conclusive answer to this question.
If you follow most East Europeans, the United Kingdom and the Bush administration, the answer is “strategic adversary.”
But most West Europeans prefer “difficult partner.”
These seemingly mutually exclusive alternatives have one thing in common: neither of them has been thought through to the end.
If you see Russia as a strategic adversary – and the restoration of Great Russian power politics under Vladimir Putin, to the detriment of the rule of law in domestic and foreign policy, does indeed speak for it – then the West should fundamentally change its agenda.
While Russia is no longer the superpower it was in the Soviet era, militarily it is still a great power, at least in Europe and Asia.
To address the numerous regional conflicts (Iran, Middle East, Afghanistan/Pakistan, Central Asia, North Korea) and global challenges (climate protection, disarmament, arms control, nuclear anti-proliferation, energy security) that have high priority on the Western agenda, cooperation with Russia is necessary.
A strategic confrontation with Moscow, i.e., a new kind of “mini-Cold War,” would undermine this agenda, or at least complicate its implementation significantly.
So the question is simply whether the threat emanating from Russia is so grave that this kind of strategic reorientation on the part of the West is required?
I believe it is not.
Putin’s claim to great-power status and his great-power policies are structurally very vulnerable.
This is especially true at times where the price of oil has fallen below $40 per barrel.
And he knows that.
Demographically, Russia is in a dramatic nose-dive; it remains economically and socially backward; its infrastructure is underdeveloped, as are its investments in education and vocational training.
Economically, it mainly relies on energy and commodity exports, and in its modernization efforts, it is largely dependent on the West, particularly Europe.
Due to its geopolitical position and its potential, however, Russia will remain a permanent strategic factor in Europe and Asia that cannot be ignored.
To integrate the country into a strategic partnership is therefore in the West’s interest.
But this would require a Western policy based on long-term thinking and a self-confident and strong power position, because the Kremlin will perceive any sign of division and weakness as encouragement to return to Great Russian power politics.
A few months ago, the Russian government came up with a proposal to negotiate a new European order within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Russia considers the agreements from the 1990’s unjust, based as they were on its weakness at the time, and it wants to revise them.
Moscow’s main strategic objective is the weakening or even roll-back of NATO as an Ant-Russian military alliance and the re-establishment of its East European and Central Asian zones of influence.
But Putin is making a big mistake here, because all these aims are unacceptable for the West, and the Kremlin still doesn’t seem to understand that the best and most effective guarantee of NATO’s existence was, is, and will continue to be an aggressive Russian foreign policy.
In the former mother country of Marxism-Leninism, the leaders still don’t seem to understand dialectics.
After all, if Russia’s government really wanted to achieve a change in the post-Soviet status quo, it should, first and foremost, pursue a policy vis-à-vis its neighbors that reduces rather than increases fears.
But this applies similarly, if in reverse, to the West: on the one hand, the principles of a new Europe as defined by the OSCE after 1989/1990 don’t allow decisions about alliances to be subject to the veto of a large neighbor.
The same is true for free and secret elections and the inviolability of borders.
On the other hand, the missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic, and the prospect of NATO accession for Georgia and Ukraine, assume confrontation where this was not at all necessary.
The West should not reject Russia’s wish for new negotiations on a European security system.
Instead, it should be viewed as an opportunity finally to answer the key question of Russia’s place within Europe.
NATO must play the central role here, because it is indispensable for the vast majority of Europeans and for America.
The possible trade-off could be that the existing principles and institutions of the post-Soviet European order, including NATO, remain unchanged and are accepted and implemented by Russia, which would get a significantly enhanced role within NATO, including the perspective of full membership.
The peripheral nature of the NATO-Russia Council was clearly not enough and did not work.
But why not think about transforming NATO into a real European security system, including Russia?
The rules of the game would be changed and a whole variety of strategic goals could be achieved – European security, neighborhood conflicts, energy security, arms reduction, anti-proliferation, etc.
Yes, such a bold step would transform NATO.
But it would transform Russia even more.
If the West approaches these discussions with Russia without illusions, with a clear understanding of its own strategic interests, and with new ideas for partnership and cooperation, the worst to be feared is failure.
Of course, this approach presupposes two things that don’t exist at the moment: a common transatlantic approach to dealing with Russia, and a European Union that acts in much greater unison and is therefore stronger.
Nonetheless, the challenge posed by Russia does not allow any further procrastination.
There is simply too much at stake.

A Japanese Metamorphosis?
OSAKA – Yesterday’s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955.
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.
The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding.
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy
Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.
For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.
Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling.
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.
Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins, which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests.
Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due.
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.
So, without breaking the regular budget cycle, the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but will also be stuck with next year’s budget, which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced.
As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP’s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch. It will also revise the supplementary budget as well.
But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen.
To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries’ top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister.
Unfortunately, the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill, which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees.
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them.
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state.
As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well.
They will most likely succeed.
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament).
Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters.
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity.
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers.
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged.
Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions.
And what of the LDP?
Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds.
Unable to pay off its constituencies, disintegration looms, for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support, but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country’s industrial sectors, occupational associations, and local communities.
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.
The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support, so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.
If the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister, as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role.

Can Joe Biden’s America Be Trusted?
CAMBRIDGE – Friends and allies have come to distrust the United States.
Trust is closely related to truth, and President Donald Trump is notoriously loose with the truth.
All presidents have lied, but never on such a scale that it debases the currency of trust.
International polls show that America’s soft power of attraction has declined sharply over Trump’s presidency.
Can President-elect Joe Biden restore that trust?
In the short run, yes.
A change of style and policy will improve America’s standing in most countries.
Trump was an outlier among US presidents.
The presidency was his first job in government, after spending his career in the zero-sum world of New York City real estate and reality television, where outrageous statements hold the media’s attention and help you control the agenda.
In contrast, Biden is a well-vetted politician with long experience in foreign policy derived from decades in the Senate and eight years as vice president.
Since the election, his initial statements and appointments have had a profoundly reassuring effect on allies.
Trump’s problem with allies was not his slogan “America First.”
As I argue in Do Morals Matter?
Presidents and Foreign Policy from FDR to Trump, presidents are entrusted with promoting the national interest.
The important moral issue is how a president defines the national interest.
Trump chose narrow transactional definitions and, according to his former national security adviser, John Bolton, sometimes confused the national interest with his own personal, political, and financial interests.
In contrast, many US presidents since Harry Truman have often taken a broad view of the national interest and did not confuse it with their own.
Truman saw that helping others was in America’s national interest, and even forswore putting his name on the Marshall Plan for assistance to post-war reconstruction in Europe.
In contrast, Trump had disdain for alliances and multilateralism, which he readily displayed at meetings of the G7 or NATO.
Even when he took useful actions in standing up to abusive Chinese trade practices, he failed to coordinate pressure on China, instead levying tariffs on US allies.
Small wonder that many of them wondered if America’s (proper) opposition to the Chinese tech giant Huawei was motivated by commercial rather than security concerns.
And Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization sowed mistrust about American commitment to dealing with transnational global threats such as global warming and pandemics.
Biden’s plan to rejoin both, and his reassurances about NATO, will have an immediate beneficial effect on US soft power.
But Biden will still face a deeper trust problem.
Many allies are asking what is happening to American democracy.
How can a country that produced as strange a political leader as Trump in 2016 be trusted not to produce another in 2024 or 2028?
Is American democracy in decline, making the country untrustworthy?
The declining trust in government and other institutions that fueled Trump’s rise did not start with him.
Low trust in government has been a US malady for a half-century.
After success in World War II, three-quarters of Americans said they had a high degree of trust in government.
This share fell to roughly one-quarter after the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal of the 1960s and 1970s.
Fortunately, citizens’ behavior on issues like tax compliance was often much better than their replies to pollsters might suggest.
Perhaps the best demonstration of the underlying strength and resilience of American democratic culture was the 2020 election.
Despite the worst pandemic in a century and dire predictions of chaotic voting conditions, a record number of voters turned out, and the thousands of local officials – Republicans, Democrats, and independents – who administered the election regarded the honest execution of their tasks as a civic duty.
In Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost, the Republican secretary of state, responsible for overseeing the election, defied baseless criticism from Trump and other Republicans, declaring, “I live by the motto that numbers don’t lie.”
Trump’s lawsuits alleging massive fraud, lacking any evidence to support them, were thrown out in court after court, including by judges Trump had appointed.
And Republicans in Michigan and Pennsylvania resisted his efforts to have state legislators overturn the election results.
Contrary to the left’s predictions of doom and the right’s predictions of fraud, American democracy proved its strength and deep local roots.
But Americans, including Biden, will still face allies’ concerns about whether they can be trusted not to elect another Trump in 2024 or 2028.
They note the polarization of the political parties, Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat, and the refusal of congressional Republican leaders to condemn his behavior or even explicitly recognize Biden’s victory.
Trump has used his base of fervent supporters to gain control of the Republican Party by threatening to support primary challenges to moderates who don’t fall into line.
Journalists report that about half the Republicans in the Senate disdain Trump, but they also fear him.
If Trump tries to maintain control over the party after he leaves the White House, Biden will face a difficult task working with a Republican-controlled Senate.
Fortunately for US allies, while Biden’s political skills will be tested, the US Constitution provides a president more leeway in foreign than in domestic policy, so the short-term improvements in cooperation will be real.
Moreover, unlike in 2016, when Trump was elected, a recent Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll shows that 70% of Americans want an outward-oriented cooperative foreign policy– a record high.
But the lingering long-run question of whether allies can trust America not to produce another Trump cannot be answered with complete assurance.
Much will depend on controlling the pandemic, restoring the economy, and Biden’s political skill in managing the country’s political polarization.

The New Middle East Order
Sometime this month, President George W. Bush will – reluctantly – announce a new policy for the United States in Iraq.
A new policy is needed not only in order to halt America’s drift into impotence as it tries to prevent Iraq from spiraling into full-scale civil war, but also because the map of power in the Middle East has changed dramatically.
That map has been in constant flux for the last 60 years, during which the main players – Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel, and Iran – have formed and broken alliances.
Now, something like a dividing line is emerging, and if Bush finally begins to understand the region’s dynamics, he may be able to craft a policy with a chance of success.
This regional realignment is typified by the emergence of a de facto alliance that dare not speak its name.
Israel and Saudi Arabia, seemingly the most unlikely of allies, have come together to contain their common enemy: Iran, with its mushrooming influence in Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine.
Iran not only threatens Israel (and the region) with its desire for a nuclear capability and its Shi’a proxy militants; it is also seeking to usurp the traditional role of moderate Sunni Arab regimes as the Palestinians’ defenders.
After decades of using concern for the Palestinian cause to shore up popular support for their own ineffective and undemocratic regimes, these moderate Arab leaders have now been put on the defensive by Iran’s quest for hegemony.
If Iran succeeds in being seen as the genuine patron of Palestinian national aspirations, it will also succeed in legitimizing its claim for dominance in the Middle East.
Israel, a country in shock following its failure to destroy Hezbollah last summer, and humiliated by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejhad’s vow to “wipe Israel off the map” – a threat backed up by Iran’s support of Hamas and Hezbollah – now talks about a “quartet of moderates” as the region’s only hope.
Indeed, Israel now sees its security as relying not so much on a US guarantee, but on Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey (which is seeking regional influence in fear of rejection by the European Union) restraining Iran and its paid proxies.
According to Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, Israel hopes to isolate and contain the Shi’a/Farsi spheres of power by forging open cooperation with the Sunni/Arab domain.
Saudi Arabia is just as eager to contain the Iranian threat and the growing “Shi’a crescent” that, with the empowerment of the Shi’a in Iraq, has moved westward to begin to include the Shi’a regions of the Kingdom.
So it should be no surprise that the Saudi regime was the first to condemn Shi’a Hezbollah at the start of the war with Israel, and that it announced in December that it would support Iraq’s Sunnis militarily should a precipitate US withdrawal incite a Sunni/Shi’a civil war there.
The Shi’a threat to the Saudi government is ideological.
Indeed, it goes to the heart of the Saudi state’s authority, owing to the Al Saud royal family’s reliance on Wahhabi Islam to legitimate its rule.
Since the Wahhabis consider the Shi’a apostates, the challenge from the Shi’a – both within and without Saudi Arabia – represents a mortal threat.
So Saudi Arabia is ready to cooperate with Israel not only against Iran, but also against other “radicals,” such as Hamas.
Remarkably, Palestine’s Hamas prime minister, Ismael Haniyeh, was not received in Saudi Arabia in December, when he was traveling through the region pleading for support for his beleaguered government.
Conservative Saudi Arabia prefers dealing with traditional and predictable leaders, such as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Lebanon’s premier, Fouad Siniora, rather than firebrand populist leaders like Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas’ Khalid Meshal, and Iran’s Ahmadinejhad.
Last year, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, worried by Shi’a expansionism, was persuaded by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the head of his National Security Council, to coordinate policy with Israel to counter Iran’s growing influence.
Israel, after all, is a “reliable enemy” for Saudi Arabia, having destroyed Nasser’s Egyptian army in 1967 – a time when the Saudis were fighting Egypt by proxy in Yemen.
So Prince Turki al-Faysal, the long time head of Saudi intelligence, has met with Meir Dagan, the head of Israel’s Mossad, while Bandar met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jordan the same month.
Yet covert support from Israel, America, and the Saudis for Abbas and Siniora does little to help them in their domestic battles.
From Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and Sudan to Bahrain and Yemen – indeed, throughout the Muslim world from Jakarta to Nigeria – Islamic radicals have won the popularity sweepstakes.
A recent poll in Egypt ranked Nasrallah, Meshal, and Ahmadinejhad as the three most popular figures.
This leads to an unavoidable dilemma: Bush will have to choose between supporting democracy and backing those who want to fight Islamic radicalism.
Yet Israel, America, and the region’s moderates can benefit from the deepening schism in the Arab/Muslim world.
That schism is being consolidated by Saudi support of all the region’s Sunni Muslims.
It is this sense of “Sunni solidarity” that is becoming the decisive factor in the war for the soul of Islam, and in the struggle for mastery in the Middle East that is now underway.

The Tribalist Threat to Climate Action
HONG KONG – Two global struggles – Cold War II and the fight against climate change – are colliding.
By agreeing to hold a virtual summit before the end of this year, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have signaled that they want to prevent relations from deteriorating to the point that miscalculation could lead to armed conflict – a risk that recent tensions in the Taiwan Strait have highlighted.
But Biden and Xi must also ensure that their great-power competition does not hamper cooperation on the existential threat of climate change.
The upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow represents a major opportunity for the United States and China to show their commitment to confronting that threat.
There is reason for hope.
Since 2015, when COP21 delivered the Paris climate agreement, the dangers of global warming have become impossible to ignore, owing to five of the hottest years on record.
Moreover, both the US and China have set ambitious climate goals.
Even the corporate sector seems to have woken up to the risks of inaction – and to the opportunities the green transition represents.
China alone may have to spend up to $47 trillion to reach its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2060.
That is a lot of investment that could be directed toward companies that deliver innovative solutions.
But, as the environmentalist Paul Gilding argued a decade ago, addressing climate change will require not only a large-scale mobilization, on par with that seen during World War II, but also a dramatic shift in mindset.
We must replace our “addiction to growth” with an “ethic of sustainability.”
Gilding quoted the economist Kenneth Boulding: “Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.”
So, average growth will probably need to slow down.
At the same time, however, the ratio of consumption to investment must change, because massive resources will be needed to address climate change, as well as meet other social and development goals, such as reducing inequality.
The good news is that global actors, including the International Monetary Fund, increasingly recognize the need for systemic change.
And China has quietly stopped targeting GDP growth – a sign that sustainability is now being prioritized over the blind pursuit of higher output.
But, as Gilding recognized, such a systems change will be exceptionally difficult, not least because growth is currently hard-wired into profit plans, debt contracts, consumption decisions, and public policies.
The shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world complicates the situation further, because no single power can take responsibility for making tough decisions about global action.
Add to that the zero-sum logic of a new cold war, and systemic change becomes all but impossible.
And intensifying tribalism is making that outcome increasingly likely. For example, China views US concerns about its actions in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as nothing more than a bid to undermine its sovereignty.
Diverting resources from addressing domestic inequities to pursuing an arms race is a tribalist response.
Beyond fueling great-power competition, tribalism has made rational negotiations harder at the national and local levels.
As Amy Chua, Reuben E. Brigety II, and others have observed, tribalism has fractured US politics, fueling social polarization and leading to gridlock on many urgent issues.
The gutting of the Biden administration’s $5.4 trillion spending plan is a case in point.
When it comes to climate action, gridlock at both the national and global levels is a nightmare scenario.
To understand how to counter tribalism, we must first consider why it has been gaining ground.
The post-WWII decolonization push and the post-1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc doubled the number of sovereign states from just over 100 in 1945 to nearly 200 by 2020.
Between 1950 and 2018, the world population tripled.
And while per capita income more than quadrupled, the gains were not distributed equitably – far from it.
In 2018, the world’s top 2,000 public companies held $189 trillion in assets – 2.2 times world GDP.
They had a market value of $56.8 trillion – two-thirds of world GDP.
Today, the world’s 26 richest people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population.
As the wealthiest have gained an increasing share of income, wealth, power, and privilege, middle- and working-class households’ income has stagnated in many places.
Rising inequality and economic insecurity have fueled popular frustration, contributing to the rise of tribalist political movements around the world.
Much of the world is now stuck in a vicious cycle of social polarization, environmental degradation, and civil conflict.
Given this, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres put it last year, inequality is the defining issue of our time, and any effort to address climate change must be built on principles of justice.
In fact, to overcome tribalist resistance to policy action, countries will have to go further, negotiating – and delivering – a new social contract.
But this will not happen before COP26.
The question now is whether a tribally divided US can agree to any rules of engagement with China.
And, after Donald Trump’s disruptive presidency, the Chinese remain concerned that any deal with Biden could change if he loses his congressional majority next year.
While tribalism hampers progress at the national and global levels, many cities and smaller communities are taking matters into their own hands, sometimes with private funding.
This is certainly welcome, and a testament to the value of strong local leadership.
But to overcome a challenge like climate change, effective national and global policies will also be needed.
Negotiating a new social contract will be a long and difficult process.
But it is essential to counter tribalism and avert a future of great-power conflict and runaway climate change.

How to Help the Middle East
BEIRUT – In Lebanon today, all the symptoms of the Middle East’s current turmoil are visible.
Newly arrived refugees from Syria and Iraq are joining Palestinian refugees who have long been here.
The country hasn’t had a president for two years, as rival political factions, reflecting the rising enmity between their Iranian and Saudi Arabian backers, are weakening domestic governance.
Political corruption runs rampant.
The garbage doesn’t always get picked up.
But Lebanon also shows signs of resilience.
Investors and entrepreneurs are taking risks to start new businesses.
Civil-society groups are proposing and implementing useful initiatives.
Refugees are going to school.
Political enemies are collaborating to minimize security risks, and religious leaders advocate coexistence and tolerance.
Lebanon’s resilience owes much to the memory of its painful civil war (1975-1990).
By contrast, the rest of the region’s experiences – which involve a long history of autocratic governance and neglect of long-simmering grievances – have fanned the flames of conflict.
Syria, Iraq, and Yemen are now riven by war.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians’ worsening plight is still a perennial grievance on the Arab and Muslim street.
In this maelstrom, new radical groups with transnational agendas are blossoming.
In the last two years, conflicts have spilled over national borders, threatening global security.
The Islamic State has exploited long-standing Sunni grievances to challenge the territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, creating a strategic vacuum in which Russia, Iran, the United States, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia now vie for power, sometimes through proxies, but increasingly through direct military intervention.
Each country has its own agenda.
Iran seeks to project its influence in support of the region’s historically dominant Shia populations, while Saudi Arabia pushes back by arming rebel factions opposing Syria’s Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, and by fighting what it views as an Iranian presence in its own backyard, in Yemen.
As for Turkey, it opposes the creation of a Kurdish state, which became possible when Iraq and Syria came undone territorially.
With the region seemingly being sucked deeper into a vortex of permanent conflict, it is easy to believe that only dictators or religious bigots could impose any stability.
But to think that is to forget past progressive uprisings, such as in Beirut in 2005, Algiers and Tehran in 2009, and the Arab Spring that began in Tunisia and spread throughout the region in 2011.
To understand where the Middle East is going, we need to look further back to comprehend how the region arrived at this point.
Arab nationalism and its modernizing aspirations began to unravel after the Arab defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the 1986 oil-price collapse.
National leaders maintained control through repression and used Islamic opposition parties as scarecrows to avoid political reform.
National economies, weighed down by cronyism, delivered low growth, and governments lost legitimacy.
It was this strategy’s untenability that led in 2011 to the fall of regimes – in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere – that pursued it.
With no institutions left to ensure a peaceful political transition in these countries, violent groups had an advantage over ordinary citizens, and a crude fight for power ensued.
Violent revolutions can reach peaceful resolutions, but such an outcome is less likely where deep, unresolved sectarian grievances are in play, as they are in the Middle East.
The renewed salience of old, intractable cleavages – reflected in the grievances of Sunnis in Syria and Iraq, of Shias in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and of Kurds and Palestinians everywhere – makes the current situation especially precarious.
These problems were simmering beneath the surface of autocratic repression for decades.
Now, Pandora’s box has been opened, revealing an incredibly complex geopolitical puzzle.
The West deserves a share of the blame for the current situation.
It failed to end the long-standing Palestinian conflict, and it created new problems by dismantling the Iraqi state, funding mujahedeen in Afghanistan, and backing dictators who supported its security agenda in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere.
With the latest great-power interventions by the US and Russia, many are reminded of the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement between Great Britain and France to draw new national borders in the region and divide it into spheres of influence.
But, if anything, Sykes-Picot provides a good model for what to avoid in rebuilding the Middle East.
The region does not need new borders and new protectorates, but rather better states, built to be resilient against ethnic divisions and less vulnerable to external influence.
Opinion polls indicate that the vast majority of people in the Middle East want to be governed by legitimate states that uphold the rule of law, protect civic rights, and promote coexistence among communities.
This is a worthy goal that will require compromise and reconciliation at a global, regional, and national level.
For national actors to have space to find solutions, it is necessary to de-escalate tensions and find compromises – first globally, between the US and Russia, and then regionally, among Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
The goal must be to reach a grand bargain that takes into account the major issues dividing the region, including the status of the Palestinians and Kurds, and creates conditions for viable political settlements in Syria and Iraq.
Addressing problems that have remained unsolved for decades is a tall order, but inaction is no longer affordable.
And none of the major fault lines of the Middle East can be resolved in isolation anymore.
As Antonio Gramsci argued long ago in his Prison Notebooks, “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born, and in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”
That is the Middle East’s situation in a nutshell.
Helping it build a new regional order will require all actors, great and small, to accept compromise, as the Lebanese have done.
A war that leaves one side vanquished is never over.

Cut the Spending, Spare the Poor
PARIS – Why do some governments spend more than others?
The question is more complicated than it appears, especially in the case of European governments.
The answer may look obvious when comparing, say, Denmark (where public spending, excluding interest payments on debt, amounted to 58% of GDP in 2012) and the United States (where the same number was 35%).
Extensive public services and a comprehensive welfare state appear to be the indisputable explanation.
The data seem to vindicate German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s famous statement that Europe’s problem is that it accounts for 7% of the world’s population, 25% of its GDP, and 50% of its social spending.
From this perspective, European governments face an uncomfortable choice.
Most are seeking ways to contain public indebtedness, trim deficits, and cut spending without making their poorer citizens worse off.
But, judging by the experience of the US and other non-European countries, they may have to choose between insolvency and inequality.
Having reached the point at which taxes can scarcely be increased further, these governments cannot both repay their debts and keep welfare spending at current levels.
The answer, however, is less obvious when comparing European countries to one another.
Most share a preference for socializing risk and an aversion to inequality – the pillars of the “European social model.”
Yet their public-spending levels differ significantly.
The highest spender is Denmark, with its 58%-of-GDP mark, which is a whopping 13 percentage points higher than in Spain.
Even more striking perhaps, French public bodies spend 12 percentage points of GDP more than those in Germany, with no significant difference in outcomes in terms of health, education, or poverty.
This suggests that some countries are more efficient at social welfare than others.
Furthermore, some countries have succeeded in reducing their public spending significantly without changing their social model altogether.
Swedish public spending is nine percentage points lower than it was in 1995.
There were welfare-spending cuts along the road, yet the country still ranks at or near the top of most development indicators and continues to be perceived as a social-democratic role model.
This is not to say that all European countries provide the same social safety net.
Unemployment benefits or public pensions are not identical in, say, Ireland and Finland.
But differences in public-spending levels are not matched one for one by differences in social outcomes.
There are several explanations for that.
One is the sheer cost-effectiveness of public programs.
Some health-care systems are simply better managed than others, because expensive equipment is used more intensively, patients are provided with generics instead of premium drugs, and timely prevention helps contain treatment costs.
More efficient health care does not presuppose higher inequality; on the contrary, it may reduce inequality.
A second reason for the significant differences in European countries’ spending levels is that public and private expenditure can be highly substitutable.
Contributions to a public pay-as-you-go pension system are very similar to those made to a mandatory private insurance system.
For example, one reason why France spends a lot on public pensions is that there are virtually no private pension schemes in the country.
If employees were mandated to subscribe to a company or industry fund, public spending would mechanically drop, but not much would change.
True, public pension schemes generally involve some degree of redistribution.
But they mostly take money from employees when they are active to redistribute it to them when they retire.
The difficult question is whether employees in fact regard these contributions as their own savings or merely as taxes – in which case they may discourage labor or create incentives to work in the black economy.
In any case, if desired, substitution of private for public pension schemes may help reduce government spending without major distributive effects.
A third reason for the disparities in European public-spending levels is that governments often aim at alleviating the consequences of market inefficiencies – and miss the mark.
Consider housing.
Public programs are necessary to provide affordable housing to the poor and the young and to help foster energy saving.
But they often do much more: they provide unnecessary support to middle-class households – or, worse, subsidize landlords indirectly by helping tenants pay the rent.
The same applies to labor-market or enterprise policies.
Public spending in these cases does not serve its stated aims; rather, it finances middle-class welfare or even capital owners’ welfare.
Cutting such spending may be difficult in the short term, but it can be achieved without adverse social consequences in the medium term.
In the end, it is difficult to disentangle the various causes of higher public spending in some countries relative to others.
Clearly, some social models are more generous than others, and some are more efficient than others.
But, though some governments have no choice but to cut inequality-reducing programs, and others may find it more politically expedient to change the distribution of income than to enforce efficiency, much can be done to improve the cost-effectiveness of public spending before reneging on a social contract.
Europe’s governments can still trim public spending without undermining the European social model.

Taking National Investment Seriously
CAMBRIDGE – This has been a brutal year, with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing governments around the world to close down many aspects of normal everyday life while supporting workers and businesses with extraordinary emergency measures.
And the crisis certainly is not over yet.
But with COVID-19 vaccination programs now in sight, policymakers and business leaders should change gear in the new year, and move from reacting to events to determining a strategy for the future.
“Build back better” has become a popular slogan nowadays precisely because most people want to look forward and create a brighter future rather than going back to the way things were.
So, what will it take to restore a sense of progress to bereaved families, struggling communities, and fractured economies in 2021?
The short answer is investment, which means incurring effort and expenditure now for a return later.
Investing in assets in the expectation that they will yield benefits down the line is a vote of confidence in the future, which is exactly what the world needs now.
Public-sector investment in improved and greener infrastructure will be particularly essential for economic recovery in the short term.
Government spending of this kind has large fiscal multipliers, especially in downturns, and will help to create demand for new skills and technologies.
Initially, major projects will have to be publicly funded, because no private firms will commit to them at a time of such uncertainty.
Yet, provided that governments invest competently and stimulate growth, adding to public debt now will prove to be the best way to reduce government-debt ratios over the medium term.
Investment is also an essential form of compensation to younger people, who have been one of the hardest-hit groups in the economic downturn.
Many who had the bad luck to enter the job market during this crisis may find their career and lifetime earnings prospects damaged as a result.
Even before this year’s catastrophe, I often reflected on the confidence that the visionary policymakers of the nineteenth century expressed in their society’s future, reflected in the infrastructure, buildings, and institutions we still use today.
They thought 150 or 200 years ahead, and we need to adopt the same mindset to recover from the shocks of 2020.
Building a sustainable and resilient economy and society requires a wide range of investments.
A society’s wealth depends on an assortment of assets that correlate with one another like those in any investment portfolio.
Some, like infrastructure and productive capital, are familiar.
Economists have long emphasized human capital, or a population’s skills, but have often measured it narrowly, in terms of formal educational qualifications.
We have learned in 2020 that health, including mental health, is an important component of human capital, too.
Moreover, policymakers have all too often overlooked other assets when thinking about the national balance sheet.
Natural capital – including clean air, biodiversity, and global climate stability – has largely been omitted from economic measurement, despite being fundamental to human life, as well as to narrower outcomes such as agricultural productivity or freedom from wildfires.
But this is starting to change as statisticians develop definitions and data to include nature and natural resources in national accounts.
Economic policymakers have also largely ignored social capital – the trust among strangers that is vital to any sustained economic effort.
Many regard the concept as too fuzzy and hard to measure, but it is the most fundamental component of a national asset portfolio.
As the pandemic has demonstrated, we are all worse off if everyone acts only for themselves.
Crucially, decision-makers need to adopt a longer-term perspective.
For too long, horizons in business and politics have been getting shorter and shorter.
Many chief executives, citing the mantra of shareholder value, make decisions aimed solely at boosting quarterly earnings, while venture-capital exit horizons of just seven or eight years are seen as long term.
Politicians, meanwhile, have gone from chasing soundbites in the next television bulletin to typing a few hundred characters in their next tweet.
Likewise, older people, particularly the baby-boom generation, have coasted on earlier generations’ consumption sacrifices.
Shockingly low maintenance spending has resulted in bridge collapses and disintegrating roads, while natural resources have been despoiled and depleted.
In some OECD countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, businesses have underinvested for decades, compensating for a lack of capital by employing workers in low-quality, low-wage jobs.
Unsurprisingly, there are both encouraging and alarming signs of significant generational shifts in views.
For example, young people care more than older generations about protecting the environment, but are increasingly dissatisfied with democracy.
Some governments are taking seriously the need for a longer-term perspective on national wealth.
Iceland and New Zealand, among others, have adopted well-being policy frameworks, while public bodies in Wales have a legal responsibility to safeguard future generations’ well-being.
Many more governments need to shift to a similar framework.
The current health and economic catastrophe arrived little more than a decade after the global financial crisis.
If it does not bring about systematic change in policymaking and business, it will be just one of many crises to come, because the unsustainable can never be sustained.
One hopes there is still time to shape how change comes about.

Global Health Versus Online Trolls
BOSTON – The most frustrating part of my job as a public health scientist is the spread of false information – usually online – that overrides years of empirical research.
It is difficult enough for doctors to counter medical falsehoods in face-to-face conversations with patients. It becomes even harder to do so when such fakery is transmitted via the Internet.
I recently witnessed this pattern first hand in Kashmir, where I was raised.
There, parents of young children trusted videos and messages on Facebook, YouTube, or WhatsApp that spread false rumors that modern medications and vaccines were harmful, or even that they were funded by foreigners with ulterior motives.
Discussions with local colleagues in pediatrics revealed how a single video or instant message with false information was enough to dissuade parents from believing in medical therapies.
Physicians in other parts of India and Pakistan have reported numerous cases in which parents, many of them well educated, refuse polio vaccinations for their children.
Reports that the CIA once organized a fake vaccination drive to spy on militants in Pakistan have added to mistrust in the region.
Given the high stakes involved, states sometimes resort to extreme measures, such as arresting uncooperative parents, to ensure that vulnerable communities are vaccinated.
This is just one regional example of the global threat that online misinformation poses to public health.
In the United States, a recent study in the American Journal of Public Health reported how Twitter bots and Russian trolls have skewed the public debate on vaccine effectiveness.
Having examined 1.8 million tweets over a three-year period from 2014 to 2017, the study concluded that the purpose of these automated accounts was to create enough anti-vaccine content online to develop a false equivalence in the vaccination debate.
Such misinformation programs succeed for a reason.
In March 2018, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that false stories on Twitter spread significantly faster than true ones.
Their analysis revealed how the human need for novelty, and the information’s ability to evoke an emotional response, are vital in spreading false stories.
The Internet amplifies the damage caused by these “alternative facts,” because it can disseminate them at massive scale and speed – a few fake or troll accounts are enough to spread misinformation to millions.
And once it spreads, it is virtually impossible to retract.
The role of Twitter bots and trolls in the 2016 US elections and the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote is clear.
Now they have affected global health as well.
If we don’t take robust and coordinated steps to address this alarming trend, we may lose out on a century’s worth of successes in health communication and vaccination, both of which depend on public trust.
We can take several steps to start reversing the damage.
For starters, health officials and experts in both developed and developing countries need to understand how this online misinformation is eroding public trust in health programs.
They also need to engage actively with global social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as major regional players including WeChat and Viber.
This means working in tandem to create guidelines and protocols for how information of public interest can be disseminated safely.
In addition, social media companies can work with scientists to identify patterns and behaviors of spam accounts that try to disseminate false information on important public-health issues.
Twitter, for example, has already started using machine-learning technology to limit activity from spam accounts, bots, and trolls.
More rigorous verification of accounts, from the moment of signing up, will also be a powerful deterrent to the further expansion of automated accounts.
Two-factor authentication, using an email address or phone number when signing up, is a prudent start.
CAPTCHA technology requiring users to identify images of cars or street signs – something humans can do better than machines (for now, at least) – can also limit automated sign-ups and bot activity.
These precautions are unlikely to infringe upon any individual’s right to voice an opinion.
Public health officials must err on the side of caution when weighing free-speech rights against outright falsehoods that endanger public welfare.
Abusing the anonymity provided by the Internet, spam accounts, bots, and trolls serve to disrupt and pollute available information and confuse people.
Taking prudent action to avert situations where lives are at stake is a moral imperative.
Global public health took huge strides forward during the twentieth century.
Further progress in the twenty-first will come not only through ground-breaking research and community work, but also through online engagement.
The next battle for global health may be fought on the Internet.
And by acting quickly enough to defeat the trolls, we can prevent avoidable illnesses and deaths around the world.

Why Pick on BNP Paribas?
CAMBRIDGE – To Europeans with whom I speak, the $8.9 billion fine imposed on the French financial-services company BNP Paribas for violating American sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan seems excessive.
Yes, BNP did something seriously wrong.
But $8.9 billion?
Isn’t that extremely disproportionate for an otherwise highly responsible bank?
French President François Hollande asked US President Barack Obama to intervene to have the fine reduced, as did the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market and services, Michel Barnier.
The fine is indeed much higher than those levied before.
Hefty fines for currency-trading violations are not new (HSBC, for example, was hit with a $1.9 billion fine in 2012); but a fine close to $10 billion is.
Three factors, not all of which are being discussed, seem to explain the size of the penalty.
First, BNP’s infraction was part of a pattern of deliberate and repeated behavior.
Second, the settlement came at a time when the American authorities faced heavy criticism for being soft on big banks during and after the 2008 financial crisis.
Finally, and more speculatively, the United States’ effort to make finance a more efficacious foreign-policy tool could have affected its treatment of BNP.
On the first issue, European businesspeople and media organizations need to appreciate fully how US prosecutors of financial crimes think.
Once an investigation shows clearly that wrongdoing has occurred, the authorities expect the target to come clean, cooperate, and restructure the firm to ensure that the infractions do not recur.
But BNP continued the banned transactions and knowingly sought to cover its tracks.
The transfer documentation reportedly was regularly stripped of key details such as the destination of wire transfers, so that the transaction would be harder to investigate and less likely to provide evidence of malfeasance.
In American corporate criminal actions, the targeted US firm often brings in a prominent figure – a former prosecutor or a former judge – to investigate the behavior and people involved and report to the target’s board of directors.
The latest example of this practice now in the news is that of General Motors, which hired Anton Valukas, a prominent former prosecutor who examined and reported on the dealings of the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers to the bankruptcy court.
Valukas’s task for GM was to investigate and report on the company’s faulty ignition switches, which have been linked to 13 deaths.
The targeted firm then typically fires the most egregious wrongdoers and puts management-control systems in place to reduce the chance that similar problems will arise in the future.
Perhaps the investigation interprets ambiguity in a way most favorable to the organization and its senior management, but it is understood that the investigation will indeed uncover the core facts and lead to effective reforms.
Some might view this way of proceeding as moralism, though some of it results from under-staffed, under-funded prosecutors economizing on resources.
The target pays for its own investigation.
BNP did not seem to do any of this with gusto; its investigation did not match the effort made, for example, by GM. It did not prevent subsequent violations by implementing effective controls to detect problems.
The second factor is that BNP’s case came to a head at a time when US prosecutors were being accused of treating banks as “too big to jail,” for fear that pressing charges against them would weaken them too much and thus undermine the real economy.
BNP just happened to be one of the next banks in line for prosecution and thus found itself in the crosshairs.
BNP did lobby European authorities to make a too-big-to-jail plea to the US authorities.
The European authorities made the plea, claiming that the large fine would cripple BNP; it did not work.
Finally, bear in mind that the case coincided with the crises in Ukraine and elsewhere, with the major US enforcement action being financial and economic sanctions on Russia, the largest of which are still being threatened.
Recall BNP’s transgressions: the US barred financial transactions with Sudan, Iran, and Cuba through banks that touched US soil (or the US dollar) in their dealings.
Most banks complied. BNP did not, engineering secret transactions involving all three countries.
At a time when the US is reluctant or unable to project military might to back up its foreign-policy goals, it is seeking to use financial might as a surrogate.
The effort might induce a financial backlash in the future, but BNP’s problems emerged when effective sanctions were at the forefront of policymakers’ minds – and, one suspects, not absent from prosecutors’ minds.
If the US is to make its financial weaponry an effective foreign-policy tool, big banks cannot blithely proceed to do what US authorities have prohibited.
It would take only a few noncompliant banks to render financial sanctions ineffective.
And it is difficult to detect which banks are not complying and to what extent.
So when one miscreant is discovered, the enforcement authorities hit it hard, to signal to others that, while they might not get caught, the financial penalties will far exceed the limited benefits of disobeying the government’s foreign-policy edicts.
This general move for criminal enforcement – greater penalties to account for the difficulties of detection – is a standard prosecutorial move in the US and around the world.
Thus, European critics of the fine imposed on BNP Paribas are right to emphasize its disproportionate nature. What they overlook is that this was precisely the point.

The Bitterness of Sugar
PRINCETON – Sugar is sweet, but the ethics of its production is anything but appealing.
“Sugar Rush,” a recent report released by Oxfam International as part of its “Behind the Brands” campaign, has shown that our use of sugar implicates us in land grabs that violate the rights of some of the world’s poorest communities.
Better-informed and more ethical consumers could change this.
We are genetically programmed to like sweet things, and when people become more affluent, they consume more sugar.
The resulting increase in sugar prices has led producers to seek more land on which to grow sugarcane.
It is no surprise that the poor lose when their interests conflict with those of the rich and powerful.
The Oxfam report provides several examples of producers who have acquired land without the consent of the people who live on it, turning farmers into landless laborers.
Here is one.
In the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco, a group of fishing families had lived since 1914 on islands in the Sirinhaém River estuary.
In 1998, the Usina Trapiche sugar refinery petitioned the state to take over the land.
The islanders say that the refinery then followed up its petition by destroying their homes and small farms – and threatening further violence to those who did not leave.
As recently as last year, the fishing families say, employees of the refinery burned down homes that had been rebuilt.
Trapiche moved the families to a nearby town, where they gained access to electricity, water, sanitation, and schooling, but if they want to continue to fish, they have to travel a long distance.
Many of them are still seeking to return to the islands.
Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo use Usina Trapiche sugar in their products.
Does that make them responsible for the wrongs done to the people whose land Trapiche is using to produce that sugar?
In the 1990’s, Nike tried to wash its hands of responsibility for the use of child labor and other unconscionable labor practices in the factories that produced its sneakers.
That did not go down well with its customers, and in the end Nike decided to do the right thing, inspecting factories, tackling problems, and being transparent about its suppliers.
Likewise, McDonald’s initial response to criticism of its suppliers’ animal-welfare practices was to sue the activists who made the allegations.
The company expected that its critics would give up.
But when two of them, with nothing to lose, defended themselves in court, the result was the longest libel trial in British legal history – and a public-relations disaster for the corporate giant.
After the judge held that some of the activists’ claims were not defamatory, because they were true, McDonald’s began to accept responsibility for its suppliers’ practices.
It has since become a much-needed force for improvement in the treatment of animals used for food in the United States.
More recently, the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh earlier this year, which killed more than 1,000 people, posed a similar question for the garment industry.
Associated British Foods (ABF), which is both a major sugar producer and the owner of the retail clothing chain Primark, took responsibility for its suppliers by signing up, along with 80 other clothing brands, to a legally binding building-safety agreement supported by trade unions and the Bangladeshi government.
What applies to the clothing industry should hold for the food industry, too – and not just for sugar, but for all food production.
Oxfam is asking the ten biggest food brands to show leadership by acknowledging their responsibility for land-rights violations involving their suppliers.
In particular, Oxfam wants these global companies to avoid buying from suppliers that have acquired land from small-scale food producers without these producers’ free, prior, and informed consent.
Where land has already been acquired without such consent, and the acquisition is in dispute, Oxfam wants the corporations to insist on fair dispute-resolution procedures.
“Behind the Brands” includes a score sheet, ranking the Big 10 on a range of issues, including their impact on workers, water, land, women, and climate change.
On land issues, Oxfam rates PepsiCo, and ABF either “poor” or “very poor.”
Nestlé scores better, because its guidelines for suppliers – used for the sourcing of sugar, soy, palm oil, and other commodities – require that they obtain the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous and local communities before acquiring land.
Nestlé was the first of the Big 10 to support this principle fully.
Then, on November 7, Coca-Cola responded to the Oxfam campaign by declaring that it would have “zero tolerance” for land grabbing by its suppliers and bottlers.
Coca-Cola committed to disclosing the companies that supply it with sugar cane, soy, and palm oil, so that social, environmental, and human rights assessments can be conducted; it will also engage with Usina Trapiche regarding the conflict with the fishing families of the Sirinhaém River estuary.
Oxfam’s advocacy is raising the standards for the global food industry.
If PepsiCo and ABF want us to regard them as ethical producers, they need to follow the lead of Nestlé and now Coca-Cola, and accept responsibility for their suppliers’ conduct toward some of the world’s poorest and most powerless people.

Drones for Development
LAUSANNE – Unmanned aerial vehicles have populated both the imagination and nightmares of people around the world in recent years.
In April, the United States Navy announced an experimental program called LOCUST (Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology), which officials promise will “autonomously overwhelm an adversary” and thus “provide Sailors and Marines a decisive tactical advantage.”
With a name and a mission like that – and given the spotty ethical track record of drone warfare – it is little wonder that many are queasy about the continued proliferation of flying robots.
But the industrial use of the lower sky is here to stay.
More than three million humans are in the air daily.
Every large human settlement on our planet is connected to another by air transport.
DJI, a Chinese UAV manufacturer, is seeking a $10 billion valuation.
Cargo drones will grow into an even larger industry in the coming years, simply because, unencumbered by the weight of humans and their life-support systems, they will fly more cheaply but be just as fast and safe.
In rich countries, early interest in cargo drones has focused on the so-called last mile – a tub of sorbet onto a suburban lawn.
But the bigger opportunities are in flying the middle mile in poorer countries.
Some 800 million people around the world have limited access to emergency services, and that will not change in the foreseeable future, because there will not be enough money to build roads to connect them.
By flying medium-size loads middling distances to many of these isolated communities, cargo drones can save lives and create jobs.
Cargo drones embody what Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, calls the “science of delivery.”
We know what we need to deliver: the solutions to many of our most pressing problems already exist.
The question is how.
Answering that question is why humanitarians, roboticists, architects, logisticians, and others have joined together in a new initiative called Red Line, a Swiss-based consortium to accelerate development of emergency cargo drones and build the world’s first droneports – in Africa.
It sounds techno-utopian – or at least like a huge waste of resources.
After all, the experience of the most successful development organizations suggests that we should be skeptical about advanced technology’s power to bring about meaningful change for the poor.
Yes, the falling cost of processing power creates new efficiencies, particularly in smartphones and related sky-fi connectivity.
But gadgets are mostly blinking bling.
It is boring stuff like low-cost teacher training, community health care, and apprenticeships that produces results for the poor.
That is why many development experts favor “frugal innovation” over technology.
The Bangladesh-based BRAC, the world’s largest development NGO, has 1.3 million children enrolled in one-room schools – and hardly a laptop in sight.
So why be optimistic about cargo drones?
Silicon Valley speaks the bulldozer language of “disruption,” but one reason to favor cargo drones is precisely that they are not disruptive at all.
Instead, they can augment existing distribution networks in remote regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America where poverty and disease are pervasive, distances are great, and roads will never be built.
Cargo drones are particularly well suited to the so-called local-agent delivery model.
Companies and organizations have shown that in hard-to-reach places in Africa and South Asia, women trained as micro-entrepreneurs are often best positioned to deliver essential goods and services to their villages, even if they have limited literacy and formal education.
BRAC’s community health workers, for example, work entirely on a micro-franchising basis, making their money from margins on sales of basic commodities like de-worming medication, anti-malarial drugs, and contraceptives.
Though cargo drones will never replace ground transport, they can ensure that vital goods and services get to where they are needed.
Mobile phones took off in Africa because the technology was so much cheaper than investment in landline infrastructure.
The same can be said today about Africa’s roads.
Like the mobile phone, the cargo drone can prove to be the rarest of creatures: a gadget that works for those who need it most.

Central Banking, Fast and Slow
CAMBRIDGE – Economic-policy discussions in the eurozone, the United Kingdom, and the United States increasingly revolve around the question of when and how quickly central banks should pull back the uber-stimulus measures implemented last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
There are no easy answers.
Both parts of the question call for finely balanced judgment calls to account for uncertainties that remain in play.
Policy changes by major central banks can have far-reaching implications for economic and financial well-being, affecting not just those directly involved but also the many countries that will end up “importing” the effects of the decisions.
A simple way to frame the debate is to think of a road trip.
In the car are two groups that agree on three things: the “destination” is to achieve high, durable, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth; the route to get there is far from straight; and the car has good forward momentum.
After that, the two camps disagree.
One group believes that much of the remaining journey will be uphill and is therefore not too worried about the curves along the way.
It would prefer to keep its foot on the accelerator, pedal-to-the-metal, lest the vehicle decelerate or stall.
The other passengers anticipate a downhill journey with many treacherous curves.
With the vehicle gaining speed, this group would prefer to ease off the accelerator and avoid risking a sudden “economic handbrake turn,” as Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s former chief economist, recently put it.
Whether you are an uphiller or a downhiller depends mainly on your assessment of three current issues: the labor market, the surge in inflation, and the risk of not being able to recover quickly in the event of a policy mistake.
The big labor-market puzzle is that, despite massive demand, the labor market is unable to match unemployed workers to jobs.
The situation is particularly stark in the US.
While Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data for April (the most recent available) show that there are a record number of job openings in the US – more than nine million – labor-force participation remains stubbornly low, and unemployment high, compared to pre-pandemic levels.
To explain this gap, some point to temporary and reversible factors such as school closures, enhanced unemployment insurance benefits, and insufficient childcare, whereas others worry about longer-term issues such as an altered propensity to work and skills mismatches.
In any case, the labor market’s persistent malfunctioning – particularly employers’ struggle to find employees – is likely to lead to higher wage growth, a possibility that fuels concern about the second issue.
How “transitory” is today’s inflation? The pedal-to-the-metal camp has a surprisingly strong conviction that the current uptick in inflation will sharply reverse itself.
As the year progresses, they expect base effects to wash out together with the supply and demand mismatches.
Others, including me, are not so sure, owing to the likelihood of persistent supply bottlenecks, changes in supply chains, and lasting inventory management challenges.
We will probably need many more months of data before we can offer convincing assessments of these variables.
In the meantime, policymakers must be mindful of the risks associated with any given course of action – including inaction.
In the face of such uncertainty, it is wise to ask not just what could go wrong but also what the consequences of a policy mistake would be.
Under the current conditions, a wrong move could have far-reaching and lasting effects.
Those favoring a continuation of pedal-to-the-metal monetary policies argue that central bankers still have tools to overcome inflation should it persist.
But as the downhillers are quick to point out, those tools have become increasingly ineffective and difficult to calibrate.
As such, a central bank that falls behind may be forced to slam on the brakes, risking an economic recession and financial-market instability.
The risk of inaction (or inertia) in this case may be larger than that of acting early.
In the current policy debate, this decision-making framework offers greatest clarity at the edges.
For example, there is a compelling case for the US Federal Reserve to start easing its foot off the accelerator.
Economic growth is buoyant, fiscal policy is also extremely expansionary, and businesses and households alike have significant accumulated savings that they will now be spending down.
The conditions are now ripe for the Fed to start reducing – gradually and carefully – its bond-buying program from its current rate of $120 billion per month.
The European Central Bank, however, is in a different position.
While eurozone growth is picking up, the level of fiscal support is not as strong as in the US, and the private-sector recovery is not as advanced.
The hardest case to call is the UK.
With growth, fiscal support, and the private sector’s prospects more finely balanced, it is no wonder two highly respected central bankers, Haldane and BOE Governor Andrew Bailey, found themselves on opposite sides of the debate this month.
Other central bankers around the world may be tempted to think that they are simply spectators in all this.
They are not.
The Fed, the ECB, and the BOE are systemically important: their actions often have meaningful spillover effects (both positive and negative) on the global economy.
As such, central bankers elsewhere should be running their own scenario analyses and formulating appropriate response plans.
There is nothing wrong with hoping that three systemically important central banks will get to their destination smoothly.
But the journey is far from over, and the risk of someone slipping is not negligible.

The Brexit of UK Banking
LONDON – When I became the head of banking supervision in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s, my friends did not see it as a glamorous or exciting career move.
Banking regulation was an obscure task, like cleaning sewers: essential, perhaps, but hardly front-page news.
Expressions of curiosity about how I spent my working hours were typically a sign of friendly politeness rather than genuine interest.
Twenty years later, the structure of banking regulation in Europe has risen to the top of the political agenda in London.
It is one of the key points in Prime Minister David Cameron’s renegotiation of the UK’s terms of membership of the European Union.
One of Cameron’s four major demands of the EU is a national derogation from elements of the uniform rulebook which the European Central Bank is seeking to introduce in the eurozone’s banking union to ensure a consistent approach across countries.
The French and others fear that this derogation could permit the UK, in search of competitive advantage, to loosen financial regulation in London, even though recent evidence suggests that bank capital requirements, and other controls on banks’ activities, are in fact now tighter in London than elsewhere in Europe.
For example, there is no European equivalent of the British requirement to “ring-fence” retail and commercial banking, and the French and German governments’ opposition suggests that there is unlikely to be one.
Of course, the reason why banking supervision – and financial regulation more generally – has higher political salience now is obvious: The financial crisis of 2008 showed that bank failures could have catastrophic consequences for the economy as a whole.
That crisis followed a period during which the financial sector grew dramatically, especially in Europe.
The bank-market ratio – the size of the banking sector relative to the size of equity and bond markets – roughly doubled in the UK and Germany in little more than a decade, while the ratio remained stable in the US, and at a much lower level.
The difference is particularly marked in the eurozone, where two-thirds of non-financial firms’ external financing comes from bank loans.
The comparable figure is nearer 20% in the US, where, as in the UK, equity and debt capital markets play a much more important role in financing business investment.
The short-term consequence was that the credit crunch that began in 2008 had a more serious and longer-term impact on Europe’s heavily bank-based economies, as banks curtailed lending to preserve and rebuild their capital ratios.
That process is still under way in parts of continental Europe, though business lending by banks has recovered in the UK.
But a new study by Sam Langfield of the ECB and Marco Pagano of the University of Naples suggests that the longer-term implications are even more damaging than was previously suspected.
Langfield and Pagano point out that in the eight years since the crisis, the European Union’s GDP has grown by only 2%, compared to more than 9% in the US, and attribute this differential to transatlantic differences in financial structure.
Analyzing data for a large number of countries, they find that “an increase in the size of a country’s banking sector relative to stock and private bond market capitalization is associated with lower GDP growth in the subsequent five-year period.”
And the magnitude of the impact they assess is considerable.
Europe’s bank-market ratio was 3.2 in 1990; by 2011, it had risen to 3.8.
An increase on that scale is associated in their model with a 0.3-percentage-point reduction in annual growth, and twice that in a housing-market crisis, given the high proportion of mortgage lending on EU banks’ balance sheets.
Many EU countries, notably Ireland and Spain, did experience a collapse in house prices after 2008.
So the relative size of EU banks might account for roughly half of the growth gap vis-à-vis the US.
That explains why the ECB, and some EU governments, are keen on the Capital Markets Union project, which aims to find ways to stimulate the growth of non-bank financing channels across the continent.
Progress would reduce dangerous over-reliance on banks.
The UK, as ever, is to be found somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic.
Cumulative economic growth from 2008 to 2015 was 6%.
A little closer to the US than to the rest of Europe, though still a relatively weak rebound from a deep recession.
The UK’s stock market is larger relative to its economy than most others in Europe.
Its banking system is large and concentrated, though new entrants and new financing channels are changing that.
Peer-to-peer lending has expanded faster than elsewhere in Europe.
UK banks are also, on average, more oriented toward non-European markets, which makes the banking sector seem larger.
And a third of the UK banking sector’s assets are in fact held by non-EU banks.
Only Luxembourg comes close, at just below 20%, while in France, Germany, and Italy, the overseas share of their domestic markets is negligible.
These differences may partly explain the UK’s reluctance to participate in the European banking union, while some other non-eurozone countries are keen to join it, fearing that, otherwise, they might be effectively excluded from ECB policymaking.
In London, even pro-Europeans prefer to address Britain’s remaining financial-sector challenges on a national basis; the differences in structure make that an understandable choice.

Reforming Greek Reform
PRINCETON – Greece's new government, led by the anti-austerity Syriza party, presents the eurozone with a challenge that it has not yet had to face: dealing with national officials who are outside the traditional European mainstream.
Syriza is in many ways a radical party, and its views on economic policy are often described as hard left; but the party's take on debt and austerity is supported by many perfectly mainstream economists in Europe and America.
So what sets Syriza apart?
All negotiations between debtors and creditors involve bluff and bluster to some extent.
But Greece's maverick finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has taken his case boldly to the media and the public in a way that leaves little doubt as to his willingness to play hard ball.
One might expect that the negotiations between the Greeks and the "troika" (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) would be mainly about reaching an agreement about the economics of the situation.
But that would be wishful thinking.
The Germans, along with smaller creditor countries, are dead-set against any relaxation of austerity and are adamant that “structural reform" must remain a condition of further financing.
They think that offering easier terms would be economically counterproductive, not least because it would give the Greeks an opportunity to go back to their bad old ways.
So what is unfolding before our eyes is not a rational discussion of economics but pure haggling.
And just about the only bargaining chip that Varoufakis holds may be the implicit threat that Greece could leave the euro ("Grexit").
The threat is only implicit; most Greeks do not want Grexit, and Varoufakis and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras have shied away of late from stating such intentions.
But, without the threat, Varoufakis's claims of democratic legitimacy would most likely fall on deaf ears in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Brussels.
Syriza would have no choice but to continue the economic program it was elected to revoke.
The effectiveness of the Grexit threat depends on two conditions.
First, Germany and other eurozone members must regard Grexit as a significant risk to themselves.
Second, a return to the drachma must offer the prospect that the Greek economy will eventually do better on its own than in the currency union (and under the existing economic program).
In the absence of the first condition, the eurozone will respond to Greece by saying, "Be our guest, leave."
In the absence of the second condition, Greece's threat will not be credible.
And here is where economics re-enters the picture.
Consider the first condition.
Some observers seem to have convinced themselves that any Grexit spillovers would be manageable.
Greece is both small and in a uniquely desperate position.
So it is possible that other fragile members – Spain, Portugal, and Italy – would be spared from financial contagion and the euro's viability would not be dramatically affected.
But the consequences are so unpredictable, and the costs of any domino effect potentially so large, that Germany and other creditors have no interest in precipitating a Grexit scenario.
On the contrary, presiding over the eurozone's breakup must be one of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's worst nightmares.
And if it is not, it should be.
The second condition, concerning the effects on the Greek economy, is tougher to sort out.
Here, too, there are plenty of disaster scenarios.
Grexit would require capital controls and financial isolation, at least for some time.
The resulting uncertainty about policies and prices might produce a severe adverse shock on the real economy, sending unemployment to even greater heights.
But there are clear examples of positive economic outcomes resulting from breaking a similar currency bond.
Britain dropped out of the Gold Standard early, in 1931, so that it could ease monetary conditions and reduce interest rates, and it did better than countries that delayed the exit until later.
Argentina abandoned its fixed exchange rate against the US dollar in 2001, and experienced rapid recovery after two bad quarters.
In both cases, regaining monetary sovereignty allowed a more competitive currency, which in turn increased export demand and assisted economic recovery.
Under Grexit, Greece's best hope would be something similar – a sharp boost in external competitiveness.
The Greek government has limited room for fiscal stimulus, and it would be shut out of financial markets.
A cheaper currency could, in principle, reverse the effects of austerity.
Currency depreciation works by lowering domestic costs in foreign-currency terms.
One such cost has already come down significantly in Greece.
Since the onset of the crisis, Greek wages have dropped by more than 15% – a process called, appropriately enough, internal devaluation.
Yet the response in terms of exports has been disappointing.
Though the country's whopping current-account deficit is gone, this reflects a collapse of imports – a result of austerity – rather than an export boom.
This fact on its own suggests that bringing back the drachma might not help Greece much.
Greek exports appear to have been hampered by other factors.
Higher energy costs (owing to increases in both excise taxes and electricity rates), credit bottlenecks, specialization in stagnant export markets, and generalized policy uncertainty all seem to have played a role.
As a result, Greek export prices have not come down nearly as much as wages.
Grexit might conceivably help with some of these costs, but it will aggravate others (such as policy uncertainty).
In the short to medium run, increasing Greek competitiveness requires remedies targeted at specific binding constraints faced by exporters.
A Greek program that identifies these constraints and proposes remedies would be much better economics than blind adherence to the troika's laundry list of structural reforms.
It would also offer a credible alternative to remaining in the eurozone under current terms, thereby strengthening Greece's hand in bargaining for a deal that ensures that Grexit does not in fact occur.

The Long Road to Nuclear Disarmament
CANBERRA – This is crunch time for the global nuclear order.
By May 12, US President Donald Trump must decide whether to recertify the Iran nuclear deal or reimpose sanctions.
Only a few weeks later, he is expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for a summit that will have implications for that country’s nuclear program.
With Trump surrounded by hawkish advisers – like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton – the odds are good that efforts to denuclearize will suffer setbacks before the month is out.
For this reason, it is more important than ever that the international community upholds existing treaty obligations, starting with the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
But to do that, tough conversations must be had.
Multilateral agreements are always prone to gaps in application; the international non-proliferation regime is no different.
For example, while neither Israel nor India have signed the NPT, both states are considered responsible members of the nuclear-weapons club.
Israel has never been sanctioned for its bomb, and India has a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group, as well as several civil nuclear agreements with the United States, Australia, Canada, and Japan.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons, on the other hand, are tolerated but not accepted; North Korea’s de facto nuclearization is considered intolerable; and Iran’s nuclear program was curbed before a weapon could be developed.
Amid this imperfect framework, many countries have become frustrated by the refusal of NPT signatories to discuss their own disarmament.
Article VI of the NPT obliges parties to pursue “in good faith” negotiations to disarm, but the nuclear-weapons states that have ratified the treaty do not interpret this as a prohibition on their possessing a nuclear arsenal.
Rather, buoyed by the doctrine of deterrence, they argue that reductions would weaken global security.
Perhaps not surprisingly, non-nuclear-weapon states see things differently.
And, last year, they committed their views to a supplementary treaty at the United Nations.
Today, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has been signed by 58 countries and ratified by eight, and if it ever comes into force will ban the use, threat of use, or possession of nuclear arms.
Better known as the “ban treaty,” the TPNW is an important step toward the establishment of a new international norm.
It is also a logical consequence of the NPT’s failings.
But, because the ban treaty goes beyond the NPT in two key respects, it has also drawn heavy opposition.
The ban treaty would prohibit so-called nuclear sharing arrangements, whereby allies of nuclear weapon states could store weapons on these states’ territory.
Moreover, it undermines the logic of deterrence by making the “threat of use” illegal.
If the global non-proliferation regime is to remain viable, the competing visions reflected in the NPT and the ban treaty must be reconciled.
For that to happen, the international community needs to agree on a strategy to achieve an international order in which the reduction of nuclear stockpiles reinforces, rather than jeopardizes, regional and global security.
No doubt these will be difficult discussions, but the alternative is far worse than a few bruised egos.
Some experts have suggested that hardline opposition to the ban treaty could prompt a backlash from countries that have grown disillusioned with the NPT, leading to widespread withdrawal from the 1968 treaty.
Needless to say, this would be hugely counter-productive.
Not only would it destabilize the existing nuclear order and heighten many countries’ sense of insecurity; it would also deepen armed states’ attachment to the bombs they already have.
Its flaws notwithstanding, the NPT has brought years of nuclear stability.
Even countries that have refused to sign the treaty have a stake in its survival, with or without the ban treaty, given the serious global security implications of its unraveling.
Therefore, all sides must urgently rediscover their common interest in practical and effective disarmament.
The two treaties can converge in a framework that minimizes nuclear threats in the near term; reduces the number of nuclear weapons in the medium term; and aspires to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible elimination of nuclear weapons in the long term.
This approach was outlined in 2009 by the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament; a version of it must be resurrected today.
By the end of this week, the fate of the Iran nuclear deal will be clear; Trump’s refusal to recertify it would very likely signal its demise.
But, regardless of what becomes of Iran’s nuclear program, or of North Korea’s for that matter, a weakening of the NPT – the bedrock of the global nuclear order for a half-century – represents the biggest threat of all.

The Euro-American Debt Dilemma
PALO ALTO – Wealthy Europe and America, crown jewels of mixed capitalist democracies, are drowning in deficits and debt, owing to bloated welfare states that are now in place (Europe) or in the making (the United States).
As Europe struggles to prevent financial contagion and America struggles to reduce its record deficits, their dangerous debt levels threaten future living standards and strain domestic and international political institutions.
The ratings agencies are threatening additional downgrades; others envision an eventual breakup of the euro and/or demise of the dollar as the global reserve currency.
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart estimate that public debt/GDP ratios of 90% are associated with sharply diminished growth prospects.
Greece’s debt ratio is over 120%, Italy’s is around 100%, and the US is at 74%, up from 40% a few years ago – and rapidly approaching 90%.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that each 10-point increase in the debt ratio lowers economic growth by 0.2 percentage points.
Thus, increases of 40-50% of GDP risk cutting long-run growth in half in parts of Western Europe, and by one-third in America – a devastating reduction in gains in living standards over the course of a generation.
Worse yet, the burden of banking losses that will sooner or later be socialized, and that of future unfunded public pension and health costs, are often understated in official debt figures.
Moreover, the problematic finances of some sub-national governments, for example in the US and Spain, will place pressure on central governments for fiscal aid.
In Europe, voters in fiscally responsible countries like Germany and the Netherlands are balking at bailouts of governments, banks, and bondholders.
American voters traditionally have favored smaller government and lower taxes than Europeans have favored (or at least tolerated).
Add continued anger over financial bailouts, rising spending, and the exploding national debt, and even America’s Democrats – the country’s traditional big-spending party – are finally talking deficit reduction.
Following the last deep American recession, in 1981-1982, when the unemployment rate peaked at a higher level than in the recent recession, Democrats blasted President Ronald Reagan for deficits of 6% of GDP.
Republicans now berate President Barack Obama for deficits of 10% of GDP.
Similar political and substantive jockeying occurs in European countries.
The simplistic categorization of political parties by their preference for a particular size of government masks more complex intraparty tendencies.
America’s Republican Party has three types of fiscal conservatives: supply-side tax-cutters, those who would limit government spending, and budget balancers.
They historically have feuded over tactics and strategy, but, since the deficit is the difference between revenues and outlays, they are closely interconnected.
Indeed, because the sum of all future tax revenues (discounted to today) must cover the sum of all future spending plus the national debt, the only way to keep taxes relatively low is to control spending.
Just as Democrats have long championed more government spending, and more benefits for more people, either on ideological grounds or as a political coalition-building strategy, so Republicans have regarded the goal of lowering taxes.
So, not surprisingly, Republicans are using the vote on the debt ceiling to force cuts in entitlement spending, while Obama and Congressional Democrats are using it to force higher taxes, in part to fracture their opponents’ coalition.
High levels of debt combine with slow economic growth in a devilish dance.
Interest payments on the debt eventually become so burdensome that bondholders demand higher interest payments (Greek debt recently yielded over 30%).
Interest rates on US government debt remain low, so this threat is prospective, but future deficits will be far higher than government projections when rates normalize.
The best response would be to enact strong controls on budgets, together with structural reforms to promote growth.
In the US, which has the most progressive income tax among the major economies, federal tax reforms that would lower the rates and broaden the base are being discussed.
In Europe, structural reforms focus on higher retirement ages and labor-market flexibility.
The deleveraging of governments, financial institutions, and households is one major cause of the sluggish economic recovery.
But sluggish growth means less tax revenue and more demands for payments to cushion hardship, placing pressure on government budgets.
The gamble has been that a solid, durable recovery would enable banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets quickly enough to avoid the need for additional bailouts.
But, so far, that gamble isn’t working as well or as rapidly as hoped.
Banks are profitable on an ongoing basis, borrowing at very low interest rates, often from the central bank, and collecting higher interest rates on their loans.
But, while instantaneous mark-to-market accounting can overstate the expected losses during a panic, the current values are often an accounting and political fiction.
Further action on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (America’s huge quasi-government mortgage agencies) and on some weak banks in America, as well as on some of Europe’s weaker, more thinly capitalized banks (the recent stress tests were a tepid first step), will be necessary.
Banking systems need more capital.
The best solution is private capital – from retained earnings, new entrants, new ownership, and new investment.
But in some cases, additional public capital probably cannot be avoided, as distasteful as it is.
The debt dilemmas in Europe and the US prove yet again that elected officials will ignore long-run costs to achieve short-run benefits, and will act only when forced, in a doomed effort to circumvent the laws of economics and revoke the laws of arithmetic.
And that implies an extended period of episodic economic disruption and political upheaval far beyond this summer’s debates on America’s debt ceiling and Europe’s distressed sovereign debtors.
These debates represent just one round in an ongoing struggle, with vast political and economic consequences for years to come.

Ending the Forever War in Afghanistan
STOCKHOLM – Speaking in Kabul on the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet Union’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, the country’s president, Ashraf Ghani, made an important distinction.
The civil war that devastated Afghanistan after the withdrawal was caused not by the departure of Soviet troops, but by the failure to formulate a viable plan for Afghanistan’s future.
As the United States considers its own exit from the country, it should heed this lesson.
After withdrawing its troops in 1989, the Soviet Union continued to provide financial support to the communist-nationalist regime, led by President Mohammad Najibullah.
But, lacking domestic legitimacy, Najibullah’s regime quickly collapsed when Russia withdrew its financial support in 1992, triggering the civil war.
Then, in 1996, the Taliban gained control of Kabul and, ultimately, the country.
The Taliban remained in power until 2001, when a US-led invasion – spurred by the September 11 terrorist attacks – ended its rule.
But last February, then-US President Donald Trump’s administration reached a deal with the Taliban intended to end the nearly 20-year-long war: the US and its NATO allies would withdraw all troops by May 2021 if the Taliban fulfilled certain commitments, including cutting ties with terrorist groups and reducing violence.
The Taliban would also have to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government, which was not involved in the deal.
The Trump administration apparently hoped that an intra-Afghan peace agreement would materialize by the designated withdrawal date, ending the fighting and minimizing the risk that Afghanistan would become a haven for terrorists.
That has not happened.
While US force levels are down to near 2,000 troops, fighting in Afghanistan has not decreased.
On the contrary, a US watchdog agency reports that the Taliban carried out more attacks in the last quarter of 2020 than during the same period of 2019.
Moreover, the latest intra-Afghan talks, which began in Doha in September, have produced virtually no results.
It seems that the Taliban’s plan was to keep fighting until US troops left, at which point they might be able to secure a victory in the long war.
Now, however, they face the possibility that US troops will not leave nearly as soon as expected.
President Joe Biden’s administration has announced that it is reviewing the deal to determine whether the Taliban is “living up to its commitments.”
The Biden administration must also decide what to do about America’s NATO allies, which together have substantially more forces in Afghanistan than the US does.
And – as the post-Soviet experience indicates – it must devise a plan for influencing the situation in the country and region after the withdrawal.
The challenge is formidable.
Afghanistan is one of the world’s poorest countries.
Today, the Afghan state’s income amounts to little more than a third of what the US pays only to sustain its various security forces, to say nothing of US aid to the civilian sector (which, to be sure, amounts to less than half Europe’s contributions).
In fact, Afghanistan has depended on outside support to sustain its statehood since Russia and Britain played their “Great Game” in the nineteenth century.
As it stands, the US seems to be leaning toward maintaining some sort of security presence, focused on fighting the terrorists of Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS), beyond the May deadline.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has advocated this approach.
But there are risks.
The Taliban could reject this solution, leading to an intensification of fighting and renewed attacks on international forces.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, is most likely already working to assess this risk.
The Taliban’s acceptance of a continued security presence may depend on progress in the intra-Afghan talks, though no one seems to have a clear vision for a power-sharing agreement.
The gap between today’s Islamic Republic and the Taliban’s desired Islamic Emirate is wide, and narrowing it will require a recalibration of the diplomatic process concerning Afghanistan.
To that end, regional powers – including Iran, Russia, and China – should be engaged in all talks about the country’s future, with one or two also taking a more active role in facilitating the intra-Afghan political dialogue.
In this process, managing the dynamics between India and Pakistan, for which developments in Afghanistan hold profound national-security implications, will undoubtedly emerge as a key challenge.
Indeed, at the moment Russia is taking the initiative in this regard.
The pressure in the US and elsewhere to end the “forever war” in Afghanistan is understandable.
But, as Ghani wisely warned, simply withdrawing international forces is unlikely to yield that result.
To avoid a new spiral of violence, we must first determine what will come after.

China Must Embrace Remote Work
CHICAGO – Before the pandemic, firms and workers around the world used emails and conference calls to reduce communication costs. But a lack of coordination made using these technologies fully difficult.
Holding a virtual meeting might be interpreted by participants to mean that the topic wasn’t particularly important. More broadly, low demand discouraged product development, leaving much to be desired in many workplace apps.
By forcing entire economic sectors into virtual work, the COVID-19 pandemic has resolved many of these earlier coordination problems. Everyone in these sectors has had to invest in new technologies and learn how to use them.
And with everyone in the same boat, there is no longer any risk that a virtual meeting will be interpreted in a negative light. Better yet, workplace apps are becoming more user-friendly with every passing week.
In the United States, companies such as Google and government agencies such as the Federal Reserve have embraced virtual workplaces and announced that a significant number of their employees will continue to work remotely after the pandemic.
This makes sense: companies lower their real-estate overhead, and employees gain more flexibility in their work schedules and choice of where to live.
Moreover, fewer commuters imply less air pollution and urban congestion.
By contrast, in China, many sectors have been able to function relatively normally over the past year. As a result, there has been neither a wholesale shift to virtual work nor much discussion of new workplace models for the post-pandemic era.
Paradoxically, the benefits that China risks foregoing would be even more advantageous for its economy than for those of the US or Europe.
For example, virtual technologies can reduce the cost of living for many workers.
Raising children in urban China is prohibitively expensive.
In Shanghai, residential real estate costs $1,453 per square foot in the city center, on average, but the average annual wage income for a full-time employee is only around $12,000.
Worse, a typical professional in these areas works a “9-9-6” schedule: nine in the morning to nine at night, six days per week – a 72-hour workweek.
Compare this with New York City, where the price of residential real estate averages $1,438 per square foot, the average annual income is $74,834, and the average workweek is 43 hours.
The upshot is that Chinese urbanites must work far more than their US counterparts to earn much less while paying similar housing prices.
By the same token, Chinese urban parents also face substantial time scarcities.
Because the average Chinese primary school student spends seventeen hours per week doing homework and six hours per week with tutors, parents need a lot of time to cajole and monitor their children (all the more so if they need to take them to enrichment activities or extra tutoring).
For many, telecommuting could make all the difference.
Moreover, air pollution in urban China is worse than in almost any other country, accounting for an estimated 1.24 million deaths in 2017.
At times, air quality is so unsafe that schools must close.
In recent years, the government has been at pains to increase fertility and reduce pollution.
In 2016, it replaced its one-child policy with a two-child policy for all urban Chinese.
And other family-support policies, such as low-cost public school and public-health provisions, are already in place.
Despite these measures, recently reported data indicate that the country’s birth rate, particularly in urban areas, has fallen to its lowest point in a half-century.
To address pollution, the government has been steadily moving polluting manufacturers out of big cities, while taxing car ownership in every way possible.
A liter of gasoline costs around $1 (nearly $4 per gallon) in Beijing, compared to $0.90 in New York.
The cost of a license plate in Shanghai is around $14,000, compared to $25 in New York.
To reduce car usage further, China has invested more than $1.3 trillion since 2000 in railways to build one of the best urban public transportation systems in the world.
Still, these policies have not been enough to offset the rapid increase in urban Chinese who can afford cars and want to drive to work.
While China’s GDP grew by an average of 9.2% per year between 2000 and 2018, its urban population increased from around 453 million to 824 million, including six Chinese cities with more than ten million people.
Promoting virtual workplaces can help address China’s demographic and environmental challenges.
The reason for declining fertility is obvious: child rearing is too expensive.
More telecommuting would cut the cost of child rearing and housing by enabling more families to move farther away from the city center.
Parents, freed from commuting, could spend more time with their kids. And reducing the number of commuters would lower air pollution.
Chinese companies that have experimented with telecommuting have found that productivity for some types of work is similar regardless of where it is carried out. And the pandemic has already demonstrated many of the environmental benefits of reduced commuting.
To ensure that car ownership does not increase in the post-COVID move to suburbs, the government should expand the provision of public transportation into these areas.
Increased virtual work could be a creative way to address two of China’s biggest problems – declining urban fertility and air quality.
Chinese policymakers and firms should allow more employees to work remotely as much as possible.
It is a low-cost strategy that can be implemented flexibly, according to the individual needs of firms and workers. The potential economic and social benefits could be immense.

Philosophy on Top
MELBOURNE – Last year, a report from Harvard University set off alarm bells, because it showed that the proportion of students in the United States completing bachelor’s degrees in the humanities fell from 14% to 7%.
Even elite universities like Harvard itself have experienced a similar decrease.
Moreover, the decline seems to have become steeper in recent years.
There is talk of a crisis in the humanities.
I don’t know enough about the humanities as a whole to comment on what is causing enrollments to fall.
Perhaps many humanities disciplines are not seen as likely to lead to fulfilling careers, or to any careers at all.
Maybe that is because some disciplines are failing to communicate to outsiders what they do and why it matters.
Or, difficult as it may be to accept, maybe it is not just a matter of communication: Perhaps some humanities disciplines really have become less relevant to the exciting and fast-changing world in which we live.
I state these possibilities without reaching a judgment about any of them.
What I do know something about, however, is my own discipline, philosophy, which, through its practical side, ethics, makes a vital contribution to the most urgent debates that we can have.
I am a philosopher, so you would be justified in suspecting bias in my view.
Fortunately, I can draw on an independent report by the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI), a Swiss think tank, to support my claim.
GDI recently released a ranked list of the top 100 Global Thought Leaders for 2013.
The ranking includes economists, psychologists, authors, political scientists, physicists, anthropologists, information scientists, biologists, entrepreneurs, theologians, physicians, and people from several other disciplines.
Yet three of the top five global thinkers are philosophers: Slavoj Žižek, Daniel Dennett, and me.
GDI classifies a fourth, Jürgen Habermas, as a sociologist, but the report acknowledges that he, too, is arguably a philosopher.
The only Global Thought Leader in the top five not involved in philosophy is Al Gore.
There are more economists in the top 100 than thinkers from any other single discipline, but the top-ranking economist, Nicholas Stern, ranks tenth overall.
Can it really be true that four of the world’s five most influential thinkers come from the humanities, and 3-4 from philosophy?
To answer that question, we have to ask what GDI measures when it compiles its ranking of Global Thought Leaders.
GDI aims to identify “the thinkers and ideas that resonate with the global infosphere as a whole.”
The infosphere from which the data are drawn may be global, but it is also English-language only, which may explain why no Chinese thinker is represented in the top 100.
There are three eligibility requirements: one has to be working primarily as a thinker; one must be known beyond one’s own discipline; and one must be influential.
The ranking is an amalgam of many different measurements, including how widely the thinkers are watched and followed on YouTube and Twitter, and how prominently they feature in blogs and in the wikisphere.
The outcome indicates each thinker’s relevance across countries and subject areas, and the ranking selects those thinkers who are most talked about and who are triggering wider debate.
The rankings will no doubt vary from year to year.
But we have to conclude that in 2013 a handful of philosophers were particularly influential in the world of ideas.
That would not have been news to the Athenian leaders who considered what Socrates was doing to be sufficiently disturbing to put him to death for “corrupting the youth.”
Nor will it be news to anyone familiar with the many successful efforts to bring philosophy to a broader market.
There is, for example, the magazine Philosophy Now, and equivalents in other languages. There are the Philosophy Bites podcasts, many blogs, and free online courses, which are attracting tens of thousands of students.
Perhaps the growing interest in reflecting on the universe and our lives is the result of the fact that, for at least a billion people on our planet, the problems of food, shelter, and personal security have largely been solved.
That leads us to ask what else we want, or should want, from life, and that is a starting point for many lines of philosophical inquiry.
Doing philosophy – thinking and arguing about it, not just passively reading it – develops our critical reasoning abilities, and so equips us for many of the challenges of a rapidly changing world.
Perhaps that is why many employers are now keen to hire graduates who have done well in philosophy courses.
More surprising, and more significant still, is the way in which taking a philosophy class can change a person’s life.
I know from my own experience that taking a course in philosophy can lead students to turn vegan, pursue careers that enable them to give half their income to effective charities, and even donate a kidney to a stranger.
How many other disciplines can say that?

Whither US Foreign Policy?
NEW YORK – Joe Biden has been president of the United States for just a few weeks, but the central elements of his approach to the world are already clear: rebuilding at home, working with allies, embracing diplomacy, participating in international institutions, and advocating for democracy.
All this puts him squarely in the largely successful post-World War II American foreign-policy tradition repudiated by his predecessor, Donald Trump.
Delivering his first address on foreign policy from the State Department on February 4, Biden declared “America is back.”
He emphasized that Secretary of State Tony Blinken speaks for him and went to great lengths to support both America’s diplomats and diplomacy.
Biden also declared that he would stop any withdrawal of US armed forces from Germany, as Trump had ordered, presumably to help restore NATO members’ confidence in US security guarantees and to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he should not try to use foreign adventurism to distract attention from domestic protests.
On Saudi Arabia, Biden walked a fine line.
He distanced the US from military and intelligence support for the war in Yemen, explaining how US involvement henceforth would be diplomatic and humanitarian.
At the same time, he made clear that the Saudis were not on their own in facing Iran.
Squaring this circle will be far from easy, especially given the added complication of US disagreements with Saudi leaders over their poor human-rights record.
Biden’s ability to succeed in the world will be limited by several factors, many inherited.
America’s ability to be an effective advocate for democracy is much diminished in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, and in view of the country’s polarized politics, endemic racism, and a year of Trump’s inept handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The good news is that progress on addressing the pandemic and its economic fallout is already visible.
The bad news is that the country’s political and social divisions are certain to endure.
Biden is fond of saying that America will lead by the power of its example, but it may be a long time before that example is one the world again admires.
Biden further reinforced humanitarian concerns by pledging to open the country’s doors to a much larger number of refugees.
What could also help would be to make a significant number of doses of COVID-19 vaccines available to the developing world.
This would be not only morally right, but also in America’s self-interest, as it would slow the emergence of mutations that threaten the effectiveness of existing vaccines.
It would also help countries everywhere recover, leading to broad economic improvement and, ultimately, fewer refugees.
Although Biden is correct to criticize Russia and China for violating the rule of law, he cannot force their hand.
Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are prepared to pay the price of sanctions to maintain political control, and the US cannot hold the entire relationship with either country hostage to human rights.
It must consider other vital interests, a reality underscored by the Biden administration’s decision to sign a five-year extension of the New START nuclear pact with Russia.
Similar realities (the need for help vis-à-vis North Korea just to mention one) will limit how much pressure the US can exert on China over its behavior in Hong Kong or toward its Uighur minority in Xinjiang.
And even where Biden can place the rule of law at the center of US policy – say, in Myanmar – he may discover that governments can resist, especially if they have outside help.
All this raises questions about the wisdom of making democracy promotion so central to US foreign policy.
China policy will prove easier to articulate than to implement.
Biden voiced strong criticism of Chinese behavior, but also noted a desire to work with Xi’s regime when it is in America’s interest to do so.
China will have to decide whether it is prepared to reciprocate in the face of US criticism, sanctions, and export restrictions on sensitive technology.
The US will likewise encounter difficulty in realizing its goal of organizing the world to meet global challenges, from infectious disease and climate change to nuclear proliferation and conduct in cyberspace.
There is no consensus and no international community, and the US can neither compel others to act as it wants nor succeed on its own.
A good many difficult decisions remain.
The Biden administration will need to determine what to do about Iran’s nuclear ambitions (and whether to re-enter the 2015 nuclear pact that many observers see as flawed).
There are also questions about what to do with the accord signed a year ago with the Taliban – not so much a peace agreement as a cover for US military withdrawal – and about a North Korean regime that continues to expand its nuclear and missile arsenals.
However Biden’s foreign policy shapes up, it is important that it be bipartisan and involve Congress when possible.
US allies understandably fear that in four years, Americans could return to Trumpism, if not the man himself.
The fear that Trump was not an aberration, but rather reflected what the US has become, undermines US influence.
The temptation to govern by executive action is understandable, but when it comes to foreign policy, Biden should try to revive the principle that domestic politics stops at the water’s edge.

Breaking Bad Habits
NEW HAVEN – It was never going to be easy, but central banks in the world’s two largest economies – the United States and China – finally appear to be embarking on a path to policy normalization.
Addicted to an open-ended strain of über monetary accommodation that was established in the depths of the Great Crisis of 2008-2009, financial markets are now gasping for breath.
Ironically, because the traction of unconventional policies has always been limited, the fallout on real economies is likely to be muted.
The Federal Reserve and the People’s Bank of China are on the same path, but for very different reasons.
For Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues, there seems to be a growing sense that the economic emergency has passed, implying that extraordinary action – namely, a zero-interest-rate policy and a near-quadrupling of its balance sheet – is no longer appropriate.
Conversely, the PBOC is engaged in a more pre-emptive strike – attempting to ensure stability by reducing the excess leverage that has long underpinned the real side of an increasingly credit-dependent Chinese economy.
Both actions are correct and long overdue.
While the Fed’s first round of quantitative easing helped to end the financial-market turmoil that occurred in the depths of the recent crisis, two subsequent rounds – including the current, open-ended QE3 – have done little to alleviate the lingering pressure on over-extended American consumers.
Indeed, household-sector debt is still in excess of 110% of disposable personal income and the personal saving rate remains below 3%, averages that compare unfavorably with the 75% and 7.9% norms that prevailed, respectively, in the final three decades of the twentieth century.
With American consumers responding by hunkering down as never before, inflation-adjusted consumer demand has remained stuck on an anemic 0.9% annualized growth trajectory since early 2008, keeping the US economy mired in a decidedly subpar recovery.
Unable to facilitate balance-sheet repair or stimulate real economic activity, QE has, instead, become a dangerous source of instability in global financial markets.
With the drip-feed of QE-induced liquidity now at risk, the recent spasms in financial markets leave little doubt about the growing dangers of speculative excesses that had been building.
Fortunately, the Fed is finally facing up to the downside of its grandiose experiment.
Recent developments in China tell a different story – but one with equally powerful implications.
There, credit tightening does not follow from determined action by an independent central bank; rather, it reflects an important shift in the basic thrust of the state’s economic policies.
China’s new leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, seems determined to end its predecessors’ fixation on maintaining a rapid pace of economic growth and to refocus policy on the quality of growth.
This shift not only elevates the importance of the pro-consumption agenda of China’s 12th Five-Year Plan; it also calls into question the longstanding proactive tactics of the country’s fiscal and monetary authorities.
The policy response – or, more accurately, the policy non-response – to the current slowdown is an important validation of this new approach.
The absence of a new round of fiscal stimulus indicates that the Chinese government is satisfied with a 7.5-8% GDP growth rate – a far cry from the earlier addiction to growth rates around 10%.
But slower growth in China can continue to sustain development only if the economy’s structure shifts from external toward internal demand, from manufacturing toward services, and from resource-intensive to resource-light growth. China’s new leadership has not just lowered its growth target; it has upped the ante on the economy’s rebalancing imperatives.
Consistent with this new mindset, the PBOC’s unwillingness to put a quick end to the June liquidity crunch in short-term markets for bank financing sends a strong signal that the days of open-ended credit expansion are over.
That is a welcome development.
China’s private-sector debt rose from around 140% of GDP in 2009 to more than 200% in early 2013, according to estimates from Bernstein Research – a surge that may well have exacerbated the imbalances of an already unbalanced Chinese economy.
There is good reason to believe that China’s new leaders are now determined to wean the economy off ever-mounting (and destabilizing) debt – especially in its rapidly expanding “shadow banking” system.
This stance appears to be closely aligned with Xi’s rather cryptic recent comments about a “mass line” education campaign aimed at addressing problems arising from the “four winds” of formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism, and extravagance.
Financial markets are having a hard time coming to grips with the new policy mindset in the world’s two largest economies.
At the same time, investors have raised serious and legitimate questions about Japan’s economic-policy regime under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which unfortunately relies far more on financial engineering – quantitative easing and yen depreciation – than on a new structural-reform agenda.
Such doubts are understandable.
After all, if four years of unconventional monetary easing by the Fed could not end America’s balance-sheet recession, why should anyone believe that the Bank of Japan’s aggressive asset purchases will quickly end that country’s two lost decades of stagnation and deflation?
As financial markets come to terms with the normalization of monetary policy in the US and China, while facing up to the shortcomings of the BOJ’s copycat efforts, the real side of the global economy is less at risk than are asset prices.
In large part, that is because unconventional monetary policies were never the miracle drug that they were supposed to be.
They added froth to financial markets but did next to nothing to foster vigorous recovery and redress deep-rooted problems in the real economy.
Breaking bad habits is hardly a painless experience for liquidity-addicted investors.
But better now than later, when excesses in asset and credit markets would spawn new and dangerous distortions on the real side of the global economy.
That is exactly what pushed the world to the brink in 2008-2009, and there is no reason why it could not happen again.

Expanding Crime and Punishment in Tibet
NEW YORK – China has been widely criticized for its harsh treatment of almost any form of political dissent in Tibet.
In 2008, for example, a Tibetan named Wangdu, an AIDS educator in Lhasa, received a life sentence for sending news about Tibetan protests to Tibetans abroad.
The logic was clear: preserve what China’s leaders call “stability” and “harmony” in order to maintain state power.
But two recent events in Tibet, involving the trials of two leading Tibetans who had not attacked or criticized the state at all, do not follow this logic.
In the first trial, on June 24, Karma Samdrup, 42, one of the wealthiest Tibetan businessmen in China, received a 15-year sentence from a court in Xinjiang for stealing antiques.
Human rights groups suggested the charge was invented, because the police had dropped the case for lack of evidence when it was first investigated 12 years ago, and neither witnesses nor new evidence were produced in court.
Despite a detailed critique of the prosecution’s case by two Chinese defense lawyers, the sentence, which had been known privately among officials for several days, was confirmed.
On July 3, Karma’s elder brother, Rinchen Samdrup, 46, was tried on charges of “endangering state security.”
His crime was failing to register a small environmental group run by him and his younger brother in their remote home village of Gonjo, in eastern Tibet.
Having been found guilty -- the conviction rate in China is around 98%, and is even higher in Tibet, so the verdict was never in doubt – he was sentenced to five years in prison.
The younger brother, Chime Namgyal, 38, who is disabled, has been hospitalized since June 11 for serious injuries received whilst in custody.
He did not even receive a trial, but was given a 21-month sentence by local officials for the same offense as Rinchen – endangering state security by unofficially organizing litter-collection, tree-planting, and nature patrols to stop the hunting of endangered species.
Even in China, such activities are not usually considered threats to the state.
These three cases are doubly inexplicable, because none of the three brothers has been accused of actually criticizing China, opposing the Communist Party, or even talking about politics.
On the contrary, they have been hailed as ideal Tibetan citizens.
Karma had founded and financed a leading Tibetan environmental organization in 2001, and was named China’s philanthropist of the year in 2006 by China Central Television (for “creating harmony between men and nature”).
And, last year, the One Foundation, a humanitarian fund run by the film star Jet Li, awarded him one million renminbi by for his “model project.”
Rinchen was well regarded, too.
His group was awarded a major environmental prize from Ford Motor Company in 2006, and in 2008 the Chinese government described him and his organization as “an extremely beneficial supplement to the government’s environmental protection work.”
This February, China’s most important paper, the People’s Daily, published a large photograph of him receiving the award, together with praise of his work. (The paper was apparently unaware that by then he had been in custody for five months.)
Indeed, a book praising the brothers for their work, Tianzhu (“Heavenly Beads”), was published in China late last year, to wide acclaim.
In June, for no apparent reason, the book was banned throughout the country, despite its lack of political content.
So, why is China targeting Tibetans who have no connection with politics and are regarded as model citizens?
Part of the answer may lie with corrupt local officials. Rinchen and Chime had criticized a local police chief for hunting endangered animals.
One of his superiors at the nearby prefectural headquarters in Chamdo is suspected of having decided to punish them, as well as two of their cousins, Sonam Choephel and Rinchen Dorje, who are also in custody in Tibet for vague or unspecified offenses.
But local officials could not have arranged for Karma to be tried in far-away Xinjiang, let alone persuade the central government to ban the brothers’ innocuous book about their love of nature.
Higher-level leaders may have taken up the case against Karma – persuading their counterparts in Xinjiang to resurrect the old antiques case – because he had used his connections in Beijing to complain about the treatment of his brothers by officials in Tibet.
This theory has gained credence because the Communist Party’s current leader in the Tibet Autonomous Region formerly held a powerful position in Xinjiang Province.
If it is true, the case against Karma suggests that officials stationed in Tibetan areas may be gaining more power, able to reach out beyond their jurisdictions to pursue what appear to be little more than personal grievances.
Nor are these the only cases.
Dorje Tashi, the wealthy owner of the Yak, a leading tourist hotel in Lhasa, is also said to be languishing in prison on vague political charges.
In Tibet, where for the last 30 years major Tibetan businessmen had been seen as natural allies of the state, such developments are unprecedented.
China’s central government has the power to rein in its local chieftains, so its failure to do so in Tibet is puzzling.
If it continues to allow such cases to go forward, it risks losing even more credibility among those Tibetans who, like the three environmentalists, have tried to stay within the law and avoid politics.
Other Tibetans may conclude that China’s government has relegated governance of their region to local satraps who have their own interests to pursue.
In an area full of suspicion and antagonism towards the state, expanding the targets of its political prosecutions from Tibetan protestors to environmentalists and from dissident monks to businessmen risks further undermining China’s own objectives in its most troubled region.

The COVID Middle-Income Trap
WASHINGTON, DC – The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on middle-income countries (MICs).
With the exception of the United States, the ten countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases to date are all MICs.
And the same is true for new daily cases and COVID-19 deaths per million population.
The economic projections for MICs are equally dismal.
Household incomes will fall across the board in 2020, including for most of the 100 million additional people globally who will fall into extreme poverty in a downside scenario.
Latin America’s experience is illustrative: the region accounts for just 8.4% of the global population, but 30% of total COVID-19 fatalities to date.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that GDP in Latin America and the Caribbean will contract by 9.4% this year, while the World Bank expects a ten-percentage-point increase in poverty in the region.
These setbacks come at a time when waves of social unrest are spreading across MICs.
With a few exceptions such as Peru or Ghana, the main drivers of discontent – especially in Latin America – have been lackluster growth, lack of upward mobility, and demands for greater political representation and participation.
Even in better-performing economies, like Chile, many feel that their expectations and aspirations have not been met, and that those at the top of the income distribution have captured most of the gains.
To make matters worse, before the COVID-19 crisis, the end of the long commodity supercycle that had boosted MICs’ exports was threatening to reverse rising living standards.
Young people feared they would end up where their parents had started a generation ago.
When the pandemic erupted, MIC governments responded with lockdowns and economic stimulus.
But the effectiveness of these measures has been limited by high urban population densities, sizeable informal economies that make human contact hard to avoid, and financial constraints that are much more binding than in the rich world.
In Colombia, for example, GDP will shrink this year by approximately 7%, the largest decline on record.
The pandemic-induced loss of jobs and income has already increased the share of the population living below the poverty line from 27% at the end of 2019 to an estimated 38% in May, despite the government’s provision of emergency cash transfers.
Moreover, inequality has widened, with the income of the poorest fifth of the population falling by more than 50%, compared to a 33% reduction for the top quintile.
The story is similar in other Latin American countries, suggesting that the economic reversal feared by those protesting in the streets last December is already happening.
Social unrest, which had been hibernating, will likely return with a vengeance.
MIC governments cannot afford a “whatever it takes” response, and are instead doing whatever they can.
But whatever they can do will not be enough, and the international community would be short-sighted to ignore their plight, for at least three reasons.
First, MICs account for 75% of the world’s population, which means there can be no effective global health security infrastructure without their engagement and support.
It is therefore essential that these countries have access to an effective COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it becomes available.
But as things stand, it seems that a vaccine or vaccines will go first to the advanced economies that are investing in their development.
Furthermore, the World Health Organization, which is leading the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) initiative together with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is – understandably – mainly focusing on the poorest countries.
There is currently no guarantee that COVAX will be able to provide the vaccine volumes that MICs need.
The “missing middle” is unable to invest heavily in laboratories and clinical trials, lacks adequate disease and mortality surveillance, and receives little global aid.
MICs’ rates of vaccination against other infectious diseases – already lower than herd immunity requires – have plummeted during the crisis, which will lead to global outbreaks if not addressed.
Second, global economic growth depends on the performance of emerging markets, which account for 60% of the world economy.
The recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis was driven by China and, through their impact on commodity prices and trade volumes, by MICs.
That is unlikely to happen this time, so MICs will need to rely on other sources of growth to emerge from the pandemic-driven recession.
Unfortunately, MIC governments lack the resources to increase public investment and de-risk private investment, so access to international finance is indispensable.
So far, MICs have had adequate access to global capital markets, but this could change without notice.
Deteriorating fiscal and economic conditions have already triggered a cascade of credit-rating downgrades that could worsen.
If markets close or become too expensive, MICs will need to rely on official lenders such as regional development banks.
But these institutions have limited capacity to lend to MICs, and will require capital replenishments.
Other financing proposals include an issuance of IMF Special Drawing Rights (the Fund’s reserve asset) or the establishment of a special-purpose vehicle to channel the liquidity being generated by advanced economies’ central banks toward emerging markets.
Concessional finance via regional institutions is also needed to meet vaccination shortfalls, finance public goods like global health security, and shore up safety nets for the poorest populations.
Finally, the world is trying to move onto a greener growth path.
The bulk of infrastructure investment over the next three decades will be in MICs, and the choices they make will determine whether the world achieves zero net greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.
A protracted crisis in MICs – where emissions are increasing faster than in the developed world – will at best delay such efforts, and could have more damaging consequences.
By helping these countries to overcome the pandemic and its economic fallout, the international community will be acting in its own interests, too.

The Two Best Ways to Reduce Infant Mortality
BANGKOK – One of the more ambitious targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the commitment to end preventable deaths of newborns and children over the next decade.
If this target is met, by 2030 no country will have a neonatal mortality rate above 12 deaths per 1,000 births – a quarter of the current rate in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Given the magnitude of the challenge, huge investments will be needed in health-care infrastructure and planning.
Perhaps the most effective way to reduce infant mortality would be to encourage uptake of two readily available resources: maternal vaccinations and breast milk.
Protecting children from early deaths begins before they are born.
When a woman is vaccinated against common illnesses like influenza, her body creates antibodies that recognize viruses and boost natural defenses against pathogens.
When she becomes pregnant, these protective proteins are transferred to her baby across the placenta.
Remarkably, the benefits continue after birth.
For example, while the flu shot is not approved for infants younger than six months old, clinical trials have shown that children born to mothers who have been vaccinated are better protected against the illness.
In one study of mothers and their babies in Bangladesh, researchers recorded a staggering 63% reduction in influenza cases among infants born to vaccinated mothers, a 36% reduction in the number of serious respiratory illnesses for mothers, and a 29% reduction in such illnesses among infants.
Maternal immunization against the flu also helps protect infants from pneumonia, a common cause of childhood mortality.
A 2018 analysis of flu-vaccine trials conducted in Nepal, Mali, and South Africa found that infants were 20% less likely to develop pneumonia if their mothers had been inoculated.
Children too young to be completely vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza were the biggest beneficiaries.
Armed with data from these and other studies, governments in low-income countries should be able to plan smarter immunization campaigns and substantially lower rates of infant morbidity and mortality.
The second way to reduce childhood mortality, breastfeeding, arguably has a greater impact.
Breast milk is the perfect nutrition for a baby, providing all the proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that a young body needs to stay healthy.
Best of all, mothers create new antibodies in real time, which help strengthen young immune systems.
Unfortunately, rates of breastfeeding and breast-milk consumption are well below desired levels.
Only 40% of infants worldwide are breastfed exclusively until they are at least six months old, as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends.
The reasons are complex, but in many countries, lack of education, together with aggressive marketing by makers of baby formula, has contributed to a decline in breastfeeding.
Recently, the United States has been accused of siding with the formula industry by opposing a WHO resolution in support of breastfeeding.
Convincing mothers to breastfeed should be easier.
For starters, breastfed babies are less likely to contract ear infections and meningitis, or to suffer gastrointestinal illnesses and diarrhea.
These advantages continue for as long as a baby is breastfed.
Mothers also benefit from breastfeeding.
Research shows that women who have breastfed during their lives are less likely to develop non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular illness, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes.
Many of these gains derive from the fact that breastfeeding helps break down the extra fat that accumulates in a woman’s body during pregnancy.
In fact, producing milk for a single infant burns as much as 500 calories a day.
Even though the majority of new mothers are able to breastfeed, not all women can produce enough milk, owing to exhaustion, depression, or physical weakness following postpartum surgery.
Some mothers are simply unable to meet their child’s needs, while others lack the medical or social support to navigate the logistics of breastfeeding.
Nonetheless, for those who can supply their babies with at least six months of breast milk, the benefits are significant.
If the international community is serious about meeting the health targets set by the SDGs, it must redouble its efforts to encourage more mothers to be vaccinated against preventable illnesses and to feed their newborns breast milk.
These two practices alone could do more to reduce infant mortality than just about any other global health initiative.

Obama’s Russian Roadblock
MOSCOW – In a recent speech in Berlin, US President Barack Obama reaffirmed his commitment to nuclear disarmament and proposed steps toward achieving that goal.
But Russia has made clear that it does not plan to pursue further reductions to its nuclear arsenal any time soon.
In the speech – delivered nearly 50 years after President John F. Kennedy addressed the then-divided city, highlighting the value of arms control between adversaries – Obama announced that the United States is prepared to cut its nuclear arsenal by up to one-third.
He also proposed major reductions in the number of tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs) deployed in Europe.
Moreover, he called upon the international community to renew its efforts to prevent Iran and North Korea from developing nuclear weapons; to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the proposed Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty into force; and to make nuclear energy safer.
Three years ago, Russia seemed to share Obama’s aspiration to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures, with both countries agreeing to limit their deployed weapons to 1,550 as part of the New Strategic Arms-Reduction Treaty.
In fact, Russia considers New START to be a “gold standard” treaty, based on core principles – modest and balanced reductions over an extended time period, adequate but not excessive verification measures, and recognition of the connection between strategic offense and defense – that should be applied to all future arms-control treaties.
But Russian officials have since reaffirmed their hardline position, stating in various settings – including at the recent European Security Conference in Moscow – that Russia will not consider further cuts to its nuclear arsenal until the US addresses certain issues affecting Russian interests.
In fact, many of the Kremlin’s demands may well be beyond the Obama administration’s capacity to deliver.
One of Russia’s main concerns is America’s efforts to build up its ballistic missile defense system (BMDS).
Although experts have disputed the capacity of America’s BMDS, Russian leaders remain convinced that it could seriously undermine Russia’s nuclear deterrent.
Russian officials intimate that the US is using the threat of a North Korean or Iranian attack on the US with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles as a pretext to erect defenses against Russia (and probably China).
Despite Obama’s assurances (and those of his predecessors), Russia asserts that America’s BMDS is actually intended to expand NATO’s role in Europe, complicate Russian diplomacy, and facilitate US military interventions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has even warned that, left unchallenged by Russia’s nuclear deterrent, the US would be tempted to intervene militarily in more countries, as it did in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya.
These concerns have driven Russia to demand that the US sign a binding treaty that limits the speed, location, and capabilities of its missile defenses and includes mandatory transparency provisions – even as Russian officials acknowledge that the US Senate would never ratify such a treaty.
Another issue constraining nuclear disarmament is Russia’s view that, without nuclear weapons, its military capabilities would be no match for the conventional forces of the US and NATO.
Indeed, many in Russia worry that a US attack against Russia’s nuclear deterrent and other defense assets that relies on America’s growing stock of long-range, precision-guided conventional weapons would be as devastating as a nuclear strike.
These fears are exacerbated by Obama’s declared intention to work alongside NATO in seeking to reduce by as many as 5,000 Russia’s arsenal of TNWs – which dwarfs NATO’s holdings of roughly 200 – and to have the remaining warheads relocated away from NATO members’ territory.
Many in Russia view their country’s dominance in this area as essential to offsetting imbalances in conventional weaponry.
In fact, no formal arms-control treaty directly covers these non-strategic weapons; nor have they been the subject of targeted NATO-Russia negotiations.
And, as long as the US has TNWs deployed near Russia’s border, Russian officials insist they will not initiate such talks.
Even if the US managed to get Russia to the negotiating table, convincing it to accept sizable cuts in its TNWs arsenal could require the US to fulfill additional demands, such as limiting NATO’s military concentrations and facilities near Russia’s periphery and resurrecting the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe on the Kremlin’s terms.Moreover, Russian leaders demand that other nuclear-armed states accept comparable limits on their TNWs stocks.
Indeed, Russia wants to replace the predominately bilateral nuclear arms-control processes of the last 50 years with multilateral negotiations aimed at constraining the offensive capabilities of other nuclear states, including the United Kingdom, France, and China – and maybe other countries.
But convincing these states to participate in arms-reduction negotiations, much less to accept new constraints on their relatively small nuclear arsenals, would be difficult.
Like the Obama administration, they believe that the next round of cuts should focus on Russia and the US, which still possess almost all the world’s nuclear weapons.
The fundamental challenge is that Russia’s leaders do not share Obama’s aversion to nuclear weapons.
On the contrary, they believe that, while the likelihood of a nuclear war has fallen sharply since the end of the Cold War, nuclear deterrence has become more valuable for Russia and other countries that are outmatched by America’s conventional military power.
This might prove to be an insurmountable obstacle to realizing the Obama administration’s vision of a nuclear-weapons-free world.

Building the India-US Partnership
WASHINGTON, DC – President Barack Obama’s first presidential visit to India offers a unique opportunity to cement a global partnership with a rapidly emerging power. Set to become the world’s third or fourth largest economy by 2030, India could become America’s most important strategic partner.
In coming decades, a strong bilateral partnership will prove vital in managing the rise of China and promoting an Asian balance of power that is favorable to India, the United States, and Asia as a whole.
India’s success as a democracy also strengthens freedom globally and protects broader American interests.
Obama has understandably focused on competing priorities, including the troubled US economy and ongoing wars abroad. India’s government has been similarly occupied with domestic political struggles and the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising pressure for redistribution.
Moreover, Indian officials must still nurture the small, albeit growing, constituency that supports a rapidly transformed relationship with the US.
This trip provides a great opportunity for both sides to reinvigorate a critical relationship.
For its part, the Obama administration should take a number of steps to reaffirm its support for India’s rise, its democratic achievements, and its struggle for security.
Notably, the US should reaffirm its support for a larger Indian role in international organizations and help integrate India into the global non-proliferation regime.
In this context, the Obama administration should endorse India’s quest for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
Obama should also support India’s membership in key non-proliferation organizations like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime.
India, too, must do its part.
It can begin by creating greater opportunities for US firms – including from the nuclear industry – to invest in India’s economic success. It can expand defense cooperation beyond purchases of American-made military equipment by deepening its diplomatic engagement with the US to help find solutions to the difficult problems stemming from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.
In short, India’s government should look for ways to sustain America’s interest in India during difficult times.
Both countries should consolidate their cooperation in other areas already agreed upon: agriculture, education, health care, energy, and science and technology.
Obama’s trip offers an opportunity for taking stock, expanding initiatives that have matured, and announcing new projects that will provide global benefits.
The latter include developing an international food security initiative, cooperating to increase vocational training in fragile states, expanding clean-energy research, investing in global disease-detection systems, and collaborating to explore shale-gas extraction.
In addition, the US and India should create innovation partnerships, which would not only yield direct returns to both countries, but would also demonstrate how a strong bilateral relationship can improve the international system.
The US and India should expand cooperation on other multilateral issues as well.
The global economic crisis and new fears of US protectionism have motivated India to rethink its attitude toward the Doha Development Round.
If Obama can weather domestic resistance to new international trade negotiations and modify America’s current position on sectoral tariff reduction by developing countries, the US and India will have an opportunity to break the impasse that has stymied the Doha Round’s successful conclusion.
Ultimately, a strong US-Indian partnership is in both countries’ strategic interest.
Their societies are already intertwined – and will be even more so in the future – by various personal, economic, and social links.
Moreover, Obama should resist the urge to approach the bilateral relationship purely in transactional terms, but instead should seek to strengthen India’s long-term capacity to be a productive partner with the US.
In short, Obama ought not to ask, “What will India do for us?”, but rather, “Is a strong, democratic and independent India in America’s national interest?”
If the answer to this question is yes – as it should be – then the US should focus on how it can help India’s power continue to grow.
By reaffirming the US commitment to aid India’s rise, and by emphasizing America’s fellowship with India, Obama can help bring the two countries together on the basis of shared interests, and move their relationship forward significantly.
That effort must start now.

Development Beyond Aid
BEIJING – Despite the apparent tranquility of this year’s spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, there are reasons to be concerned about the global economy.
The United Kingdom’s impending “hard” Brexit from the European Union and US President Donald Trump’s anti-globalization agenda are creating economic uncertainty, and will continue to do so for some time.
In contrast to Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping has come to the defense of globalization, and made new capital available for creating global pubic goods, enhancing connectivity, and creating jobs in developing countries.
More than 60 countries have welcomed Xi’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative, and 28 heads of state will attend an OBOR summit in Beijing on May 14.
So, what is China’s rationale for pursuing this grandiose vision – one that so many countries, especially in the developing world, have embraced?
In our new book, Going Beyond Aid: Development Cooperation for Structural Transformation, we argue that official development aid (ODA) need not always be concessional, and make the case for going “beyond aid,” toward a broader approach – like that taken by China – that includes trade and investment.
Right now, the OECD’s definition of ODA does not even include some of the more effective instruments for facilitating structural transformation in recipient countries, such as equity investment and large non-concessional loans for infrastructure.
By combining aid with trade and investment, donor and recipient countries alike can benefit.
For example, the South-South development cooperation uses all three activities to capitalize on recipient countries’ economic strengths.
This allows the SSDC to avoid the bottlenecks in partner countries that one sees under the standard ODA model, which separates aid from trade and private investment – and thus impedes countries from exploiting their comparative advantages.
In our book, we look at this topic through the lens of New Structural Economics.
NSE treats modern economic development as a process of continuous structural change in technologies, industries, and hard and soft infrastructure – all of which increases labor productivity, and thus per capita income.
According to NSE, the most effective and sustainable approach for a low-income country to jumpstart dynamic growth and development is to develop those sectors in which it has latent comparative advantages: where production costs are low, but transaction costs are high due to inadequate hard and soft infrastructure.
Governments can help to reduce transaction costs by creating special economic zones or industrial parks, improving infrastructure, and making the overall business environment more attractive in those enclaves.
With this approach, a developing country can grow dynamically, and create a virtuous circle of job creation and poverty reduction, even if its overall infrastructure and business environment are still lacking.
Moreover, large emerging-market economies such as China, Brazil, and India can use their comparative advantages in infrastructure and light manufacturing to help others.
For China, this is in keeping with a Confucian dictum: “One who wishes himself to be successful must also help others to be successful; one who wishes to develop himself must also help others to develop.”
China has a clear comparative advantage in infrastructure construction, owing to its lower labor costs (the cost of a project site foreman in China is one-eighth that of OECD countries) and vast domestic market, which have enabled it to achieve economies of scale that other countries simply cannot.
Consequently, the overall construction cost for high-speed rail in China is two-thirds of what it is in industrial countries.
But China’s comparative advantages in 46 of 97 subsectors – particularly in manufacturing – benefit other developing countries, too.
As labor costs in China rise, labor-intensive industries are relocating to lower-wage developing countries, providing millions of job opportunities.
For example, the Huajian Shoemaking Company, C&H Garments, and China JD Group (an apparel maker), are now operating in special economic zones in, respectively, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
In addition to exporting its comparative advantages, China also deploys “patient capital,” which has a maturity of ten years or more.
In a recently published paper, we conceptualize patient capital as an investment in a “relationship,” whereby an investor has a long-term stake in a country’s development.
Patient-capital owners are like equity investors, but they are willing to “sink” money in the real sector for an extended period of time.
Patient-capital owners are also more willing, and better able, to take risks.
In the chart below, we show that a country’s net-foreign-asset position correlates strongly with its long-term orientation.
On the other hand, net-foreign-asset positions of countries with a short-term orientation and a low savings rate tend to deteriorate, while their foreign debts mounts.
Patient capital plays an important role in infrastructure financing, because it is often accompanied by technological and administrative know-how, which helps to improve global connectivity and accelerate development.
So far, China’s large reserve of patient capital has been used to finance its own domestic projects.
But it will increasingly be exported as more Chinese enterprises and banks “go global.”
In fact, China could soon become the world’s largest net creditor, and a portion of its net foreign assets will take the form of patient capital that is suitable for improving infrastructure, developing manufacturing sectors, and creating jobs around the world.
Since 2015, development finance has started to come less from traditional aid, and more from development-finance institutions, development banks, and sovereign wealth funds in emerging economies.
China, for example, has committed $60 billion in development financing to Africa for the 2016-2018 period – much of it patient capital.
China and other emerging economies are also shifting from bilateralism to multilateralism, by working with partners from the global North and South.
As new South-led institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank work with established multilateral development banks, they are learning to be better partners, and adding momentum to global development efforts.
China, moreover, is trying to learn from its partners so that it can improve its own governance, labor, and environmental standards.
And this two-way process is giving rise to new ideas, theories, and concepts – our book being one of them.
China’s embrace of a global role should be welcomed.
We are cautiously optimistic that the North and South can work together to ensure peace and prosperity for all.

Europe’s Fight Against Terrorism
Three years ago this month, international terrorism struck Europe.
In simultaneous bomb attacks on trains in Madrid, Islamist terrorists killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000.
Last month the suspects went on trial in a Spanish court.
Violent extremists claiming to act in the name of Islam have hit many countries around the world, before and after the attacks on America of September 11, 2001.
But the attacks in Madrid – and in London in July 2005 – showed that Europe is one of their prime targets, prompting European governments to respond by bolstering their defenses, including at the level of the European Union.
In the past three years, security standards at European ports and airports have been strengthened, biometric passports have been introduced, and terrorist financing targeted.
More than 2,000 terrorism suspects and those suspected of other major forms of crime have been arrested and extradited on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant.
Similarly, European security and intelligence services have pooled resources in a common center for threat analysis in Brussels.
Through Europol and Eurojust, European police forces and judicial authorities have intensified cooperation, and ministers are preparing to grant law enforcement agencies of other EU countries access to national databases of DNA and fingerprints.
For the first time, security-related research figures prominently in the EU budget, with €1.4 billion earmarked for this purpose.
European police and security agencies have prevented many terrorist attacks.
But, while Europe’s defenses have been considerably strengthened, the threat of terrorism has not diminished.
The risk of new attacks in Europe and worldwide is serious and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
To face this global threat, international cooperation must be improved.
In particular, Muslims and non-Muslims need to combine their efforts to defend the sanctity of human life.
First, the world must work from common standards.
Many countries still need to improve their defenses and implement the 16 counter-terrorism instruments established by the United Nations, including the convention against terrorist financing.
Reducing the risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction equally requires stronger international cooperation.
To this end, the EU is working closely with its partners, from Morocco and Indonesia to Saudi-Arabia and other Gulf states.
The EU will extend support to the African Union’s Center for Counter-Terrorism in Algiers.
Cooperation with India, Pakistan, and Russia has also been strengthened, and the Union will continue to work closely with the US, Japan, and Australia.
Second, more must be done to address the international conflicts that terrorists seek to exploit.
Afghanistan remains a critical front-line state in the fight against terrorism.
The Taliban must not be allowed to bomb Afghanistan back in time.
The EU will increase its aid, notably in support of the Afghan police.
Likewise, efforts to bring peace to the Middle East remain essential.
While progress on the road to peace between Israel and the Palestinians would not by itself stop terrorism, it would deal a powerful blow to terrorist incitement and propaganda.
Javier Solana, the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, will continue to press for results.
Third, we must counter the ideology of the terrorists.
Very few Muslims want to live under a seventh century-style caliphate.
They prefer to live in freedom and in parliamentary democracies.
What unites Muslims and non-Muslims is a commitment to basic human rights.
To respect and promote human rights is critical to winning the battle for hearts and minds, including in Europe.
This means that governments need to practice what they preach.
Detention without trial is counterproductive in the fight against terrorism.
So is torture.
To defeat the terrorists we must offer a vision of a more just and equitable world and act accordingly, at home and abroad.
Ultimately, the values of liberty and justice are our best defense.

The World Economy in 2018
STANFORD – All major macroeconomic indicators – growth, unemployment, and inflation – suggest that 2017 will be the American economy’s best year in a decade.
And the global economy is enjoying broad, synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected.
The question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018.
The answer, of course, will depend on monetary, fiscal, trade, and related policies in the United States and around the world.
And yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018.
There are relatively new heads of state in the US, France, and the United Kingdom; German leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in September; and the US Federal Reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation.
Moreover, major changes in important developing economies such as Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil have made the future outlook even murkier.
Still, we should hope for the best.
First and foremost, we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4% will continue in 2018, as the International Monetary Fund projected in October.
Growth not only raises incomes, but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable.
As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
For my part, I predict that the global recovery will continue, but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5%.
The two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be Europe, where a cyclical upturn could stall, and the oil-rich Middle East, where tensions could flare up once again.
Second, let us hope that the Fed, guided by the steady hand of its new chair, Jerome “Jay” Powell, will continue or even accelerate its monetary-policy normalization, both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate, and by shrinking its engorged balance sheet.
And we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks, especially the European Central Bank, to follow suit.
On this front, I predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary.
The biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the Fed under its new leadership, for example, if inflation rises faster than anticipated.
Third, let us hope that the Republican tax package will, if enacted, deliver on its promise of increased investment, output, productivity, and wages over the coming decade.
Here, I predict that the legislation will pass, and that investment in the US over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken.
To be sure, whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate-tax rate.
But the tax package can still be expected to boost output, productivity, and wages.
The question is not if, but when.
If the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections, that lag could prove politically consequential.
The biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed, and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the Democrats are back in power.
Fourth, let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public-pension and health-care costs, which have been rising for decades.
As social programs become costlier, they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense, while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth-suppressing taxes.
Europe, in particular, must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency.
Many European Union member states still need to reduce their government debt, and the eurozone needs to resolve its “zombie bank” crisis.
Beyond that, structural labor-market reforms of the kind French President Emmanuel Macron is pursuing would be most welcome.
Unfortunately, I’m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic, at best.
The danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries.
Another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long-term investment.
Fifth, let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis.
This will depend largely on whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to Europe’s largest economy.
Sixth, we should hope that the EU and the UK can agree on a reasonable Brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations.
The main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm.
And, beyond Europe, let us hope that negotiations between the US, Canada, and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade.
For trade generally, the biggest risk is that the Trump administration could start a lose-lose trade dispute, owing to its understandable eagerness to help American manufacturing workers.
Seventh, let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology (ICT) strike the right balance among all stakeholders’ competing and legitimate concerns.
On one hand, there is reason to worry about certain Internet companies’ concentration of market power, particularly in online content and distribution, and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy, law enforcement, and national security.
On the other hand, new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains.
It is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation, or of too little.
It is also easy to envision a large-scale public backlash against the major technology companies, particularly if poor self-policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event.
Here, I predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years.
If some future event strikes an emotional chord, the public’s mood could swing dramatically.
Ultimately, however, I suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations.
Finally, and most important, let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere, conflicts subside, democracy and capitalism regain some momentum, and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain.
Should that happen in 2018, it will be a very good year indeed.

The Return of Violent Identity Politics
LONDON – I first visited Sri Lanka as Britain’s development minister in the 1980s, during the early stages of the vicious war between guerrilla fighters – the so-called Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) – and Sri Lanka’s armed forces.
This bloody ethnic conflict, pitting the largely Hindu Tamil minority against the largely Buddhist Sinhalese majority, surprised those who had previously regarded this beautiful country, with its clever population and its strategic location in South Asia, as a model of Asian democracy.
And yet it was here that many of us first heard about suicide bombing, sometimes carried out by children.
The Indian Army had intervened to try to halt the violence.
I was flown into the capital of the Tamil territory in the north of the country in an Indian helicopter gunship to see what humanitarian help could be provided.
Evidence of the fighting was everywhere to be seen. I recall the systematic destruction of the computer laboratories and other facilities at the University of Jaffna.
Years later, I returned to Sri Lanka as a European Union commissioner to support the Norwegian government’s admirable efforts to end that same conflict.
I was taken to see the LTTE’s head, Velupillai Prabhakaran, in his jungle headquarters.
A taciturn and sinister fellow, Prabhakaran was not very interested in the peace terms that Norway, supported by the EU, was proposing.
The other highlight (or maybe it was a lowlight!) of my visit was being burned in effigy by Sinhalese extremists for suggesting peace talks at all.
The civil war ended in a bloody assault on the defeated LTTE fighters in 2009.
The violence and destruction seemed to be over.
And yet tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Hindu and Muslim minorities have never disappeared.
As recently as last year, there were attacks by Sinhalese Buddhists on Muslim mosques and businesses, and the small Christian (mostly Catholic) community, numbering 1.5 million in a population of 21.4 million, has been trapped in the middle.
This religious and ethnic mix exploded on Easter Sunday, when Islamist extremists slaughtered at least 250 people, including Christian worshippers and foreign tourists, and wounded hundreds more.
It was the worst recent example of identity politics, coming only weeks after the attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, by an Australian white supremacist.
The French-Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf has described identity politics as a “leopard,” devouring men, women, and children and the values that customarily underpin any sense of common humanity.
In his own study of identity and violence, the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen recalls seeing as a child in India a terrified Muslim being chased through his family’s front garden by a Hindu mob, which hacked the man to death.
We had largely forgotten about this sort of politics in much of the world, certainly in Europe and America, in the decades since one form of identity loyalty – extreme nationalism –remade entire societies.
The Austrian Jewish intellectual Stefan Zweig’s book The World of Yesterday offers one of the best descriptions of how the rich, brilliant civilization of Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century was destroyed, first economically and then politically, by those who defined their identity overwhelmingly by their national loyalties, often attached to a bogus history and idealized institutions.
Recovering from those disasters in the second half of the last century, the world seemed to be divided over ideology, not identity: capitalism versus communism, freedom versus totalitarianism, and so on.
But those divisions, and ways of defining ourselves, have given way in many cases to an overwhelming sense of nationhood, sometimes in its most atavistic forms.
The consequences – including attacks like those in Colombo and Christchurch – would no doubt strike Zweig and Sen as painfully familiar.
There is nothing wrong with nationalism when it is simply a celebration of a country’s best values, traditions, and history.
Call that patriotism.
But nationalism can easily become a mindset that expresses itself most potently by defining people in zero-sum opposition to others.
Sometimes, these “others” are countries beyond one’s own national borders.
Cooperating with them is attacked as an abrogation of the ability to make sovereign decisions.
Sometimes, perhaps more dangerously, the “others” are members of a country’s own minorities, who may be recent or even not-so-recent immigrants, a different color, or have different languages or religious beliefs.
Politicians in Europe and the United States need to be careful that the populist nativism they are stoking, and from which they seek to benefit electorally, does not morph into more violent forms of identity politics.
What are the results of President Donald Trump’s verbal assaults on Mexicans?
What are we to make of Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s attacks on Pope Francis for espousing Christian generosity to immigrants?
How should we respond to right-wing political attacks on Muslims in Europe, or left-wing attacks on Jews in Britain?
When does a daubed message on a wall or a racist tweet risk violent results?
Liberal democracy is a more fragile construction than we believe.
In the United Kingdom, a large part of the Conservative Party has embraced English nationalism, which poses an existential threat to the country’s constitutional framework.
There are also worries that this sort of nationalism – embodied, for example, in the new Brexit Party that Nigel Farage has launched to appeal to disgruntled Conservatives hostile to Europe – will give cover to sentiments that its avatars might well publicly condemn.
Those fears are justified.
Playing with matches can be perilous.
Once kindled, nationalism can easily rage out of control, consuming all moderating structures and leaving communities – and entire countries – at the mercy of even more dangerous arsonists.

The Fall of Netanyahu?
JERUSALEM – The dissolution of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, just a day after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu sacked two senior cabinet ministers, marks a surprising turnabout.
Indeed, when Israelis vote again in March, more than two years ahead of schedule, Netanyahu could be voted out of office, with important implications not only for Israel, but also for the wider Middle East.
Until last summer, Netanyahu appeared politically unassailable.
His coalition government, despite some internal bickering, was expected to serve out its term.
Not even 10% of Israelis would have preferred the opposition leader, the Labor Party’s Yitzhak Herzog, as Prime Minister.
Things began to unravel when two cabinet ministers abruptly resigned, citing family commitments or policy disagreements.
Then came the inconclusive war in Gaza, which, given Netanyahu’s unfulfilled pledge to “crush Hamas,” undermined his credibility, especially when ministers like Naftali Bennett, the leader of the nationalist-religious Jewish Home party, openly challenged his policies.
When some European parliaments voted in 2014 to recognize Palestine as an independent state, many Israelis, who had long blamed the Palestinians for the continued failure of peace talks, began to worry.
More significant, Netanyahu’s public clashes with US President Barack Obama fueled concerns among Israelis – including supporters of Netanyahu’s Likud party – that their government’s policies were deepening Israel’s isolation and thus undermining its security.
The domestic situation is not much better.
Netanyahu has failed to fulfill his promises since the massive demonstrations of 2011 to address prohibitively high living costs, especially for young couples.
On the contrary, housing prices have continued to rise.
When Yair Lapid – the ambitious but inept finance minister, who leads the centrist Yesh Atid party – proposed waiving the value-added tax on first apartment purchases by young couples, Netanyahu failed to respond decisively, giving the impression that he lacked control over his own cabinet.
But it was Netanyahu’s support for draft legislation seeking to constitutionalize Israel’s identity as the Jewish people’s nation-state – to the detriment of Israel’s Muslim, Christian, and Druze citizens – that brought the situation to a head.
The bill, which emphasizes Israel’s Jewish identity above its democratic principles, has caused deep divisions not only among the electorate, but also within the government coalition.
Netanyahu, with his weak and vacillating leadership exposed, sacked his opponents, Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni (who also denounced Netanyahu’s settlement-construction plans), and called for new elections.
But the real game changer was the declaration by Herzog and Livni, who leads the small centrist Hatnuah party, that their parties would run jointly in the elections.
If they win, they will rotate in the prime minister’s post.
This changed Israeli political discourse almost overnight.
Far from invincible, Netanyahu is now viewed as a failed prime minister, confronted by a center-left bloc that may well become the most powerful voice in the Knesset.
Yesh Atid voters, who have been disappointed by Lapid’s failure to deliver the “new politics” of efficiency and transparency that he promised, may supply the Herzog-Livni alliance with the necessary votes.
Some of the moderate orthodox parties, which have been undergoing their own internal splits, have also signaled their willingness to work with a center-left bloc that might enable Israel to make real progress.
Even Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman, head of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, is now criticizing Netanyahu for alienating the US and has suggested that he would not rule out joining a centrist government.
All of this bodes well for the Herzog-Livni alliance.
But three months is a long time in politics.
Netanyahu may be a dismal prime minister; but he is also a formidable campaigner.
And if the centrist alliance finishes first in the election, it will still need coalition partners to form a majority in the Knesset.
Gaining fewer than 30 of its 120 seats might drive it to seek potential partners among the orthodox – an approach that could alienate moderate secular voters.
Moreover, once in power, the Herzog-Livni alliance would be met with serious challenges – beginning with reaching an agreement with the Palestinians.
Given that the Palestinians’ political leadership is divided between the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which has established an Islamic fundamentalist regime in Gaza, a deal between Israel and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would mean little.
Nonetheless, a Herzog-Livni government would bring significant change, particularly in terms of relations with Europe and the US.
Netanyahu’s provocative policies and statements, which have undermined support for Israel among even its closest allies, would be supplanted by a willingness to negotiate in earnest and make genuine concessions.
Such a shift would reinvigorate hope among Israelis – and not a moment too soon.
There is a growing realization in Israel that it is time to chart a new path.
Netanyahu, always eager to impress upon the Israeli public the impossibility of making peace with the Palestinians, failed to address the question of what kind of country Israel will become if it continues to rule millions of people against their will.
This is what has turned so many people in the West against Israel, leading some to question its very legitimacy.
If Zionism means eternal dominion over the Palestinians, is it really worthy of support?
The Herzog-Livni alliance has tentatively named itself the “Zionist Camp.”
It may not be catchy (and it is likely to be changed), but it expresses an essential truth: Zionism is about the right of the Jewish people to self-determination, not about the permanent domination of another people.
One hopes that Israeli voters recognize this in March.

Why Is Physics Beautiful?
CAMBRIDGE – The nineteenth-century physicist Heinrich Hertz once described his feeling that James Clerk Maxwell’s equations, which depict the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism, “have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser…even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them.”
Not long after, Albert Einstein called Niels Bohr’s atomic model “the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought.”
More recently, the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, describing his discovery of new laws of physics, declared, “You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.”
Similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists.
Wishful thinking could never produce working iPhones, photographs of Pluto, or atomic bombs.
Physics, as summarized in a handful of mathematically precise laws, indisputably works.
Yet many things that “work” do not inspire the kind of admiration that the fundamental laws of nature do.
Their beauty is rooted, first, in the laws’ symmetry, here meaning the possibility of change without change – a precise yet almost mystical concept.
Just as a circle can be rotated about its center at any angle, changing the position of each of its points without changing its form, symmetric laws apply to changed situations without changing or losing validity.
For example, special relativity asserts that the fundamental laws of physics remain the same when we view the world from a platform moving at constant velocity.
Similarly, so-called time translation symmetry encodes the uniformity of physical law in time: Even as the universe ages, the laws remain the same.
The second source of beauty in the laws of physics is their productivity – what I call their exuberance.
Just a handful of basic principles generates an astonishing wealth of consequences – everything in the physical world!
You can write the equations of the core theories of physics – known as the standard model – quite comfortably on a T-shirt.
To paraphrase Hertz, they give back far more than we put in.
It is important to note that the laws of physics need not necessarily have such marvelous properties.
Consider this hypothetical situation: Developments in computer power, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence enable the creation of self-aware beings whose “world” is, from our perspective, a programmed simulation.
If a self-aware Super Mario began to analyze the laws of his world, he would find very little symmetry or productivity.
Instead, he would find a vast collection of loosely connected, quirky rules, reflecting the whims of the programmer.
The beauty of physical law is too impressive to be accidental.
It has led people throughout history to believe that some tasteful higher being created us, and that we inhabit a consciously designed world, like our notional Super Mario.
But this is an extravagant hypothesis, which goes far beyond the facts it is meant to explain.
Before adopting it, we should explore more economical alternatives.
The answer likely lies within us.
Beautiful things are those in which we find pleasure and seek out.
They are, in neurobiological terms, things that stimulate our reward system.
That explains why parents tend to find their young children beautiful, and adults are attracted to nubile models and their images.
It makes evolutionary sense to reward such feelings.
The evolutionary utility of the beauty of physical laws is somewhat less obvious, but no less real.
Given the usefulness of accurately assessing the consequences of our actions, our reward system has evolved so that we derive joy from making successful predictions.
Understanding the forces and patterns defining our world, and especially principles that apply (without changing) to a wide variety of situations, can help to improve our predictions.
The fact that we can often infer the behavior of complex objects or systems from knowledge of their parts – that we get back more than we put in – can help us to hone our predictions further.
In short, because evolution predisposes us to find beautiful those things that help us understand the world correctly, it is no accident that we find the correct laws of nature beautiful.
Viewed from this perspective, the apparent beauty of the laws of physics – our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance – is not surprising.
What remains mysterious is why they are comprehensible.
A profound link between beauty and comprehensibility is an increasingly important source of scientific progress.
Today’s frontiers of fundamental physics are far removed from everyday experience.
They are difficult and expensive to access experimentally, and we cannot rely on our intuition to fill in the blanks.
The patient accumulation of fact recommended by Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and Sherlock Holmes is thus no longer practical.
Instead, we reverse the process, using guesswork to motivate experiment.
We first construct beautiful equations, then derive their consequences, and, finally, craft experiments to test them.
In recent decades, that strategy has proved remarkably successful.
It has given us quantum chromodynamics, which resolves the central problem of nuclear physics, as well as predicting the Higgs particle and much else.
Rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered, we use principles of beauty – vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input – to enable discovery.
When this works, we have an “anthropic” explanation of the laws’ beauty: If they were not beautiful, we would not have found them.

Strengthening South Korea’s New Strategic Posture
SEOUL – The geopolitical terrain in Northeast Asia is shifting, and, fortunately, the region’s two great democracies, Japan and South Korea, are moving in a similar direction.
If prudent, strategic leadership prevails in both Tokyo and Seoul, the two countries’ historical enmity may finally be consigned to the past, and security across the Indo-Pacific region will be enhanced.
The catalyst for reducing the bilateral diplomatic friction – a problem that dates to the pre-World War II era– was Yoon Suk-yeol’s (no relation) inauguration as president of the Republic of Korea last May.
With Yoon’s arrival in the presidential office, the pursuit of a chimerical “balance” in relations with China and the United States – previously a central focus of South Korea’s foreign policy – has given way to a more clear-eyed assessment of the country’s security needs.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a rude awakening for Yoon, and for many South Koreans across the political spectrum.
With China and others effectively backing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s criminal behavior, the war has called into question the entire international security architecture.
Add the mounting North Korean nuclear threat, the intensifying Sino-American rivalry, and the risk that China will mimic Russia’s invasion with a similar move against Taiwan, and Yoon had more than enough evidence that South Korean national security requires closer ties with both the US and Japan.
But while the US and Japan have assumed a more prominent position in the minds of South Korean strategists, Yoon’s government has not turned its back on relations with China.
On the contrary, his administration remains focused on limiting tensions and securing China’s assistance in reining in North Korea’s wayward leader, Kim Jong-un.
But, unlike his predecessor, Moon Jae-in, Yoon does not think that South Korea needs to create a false sense of distance from the US in order to foster ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
For Yoon, recognizing South Korea’s new national-security needs has meant embracing a more active and outward-looking diplomatic posture.
He wants to position South Korea as a pivotal player in maintaining the international order, rather than as a small regional power concerned only with relations on the Korean Peninsula.
One problem for Yoon, whose margin of victory over his more left-wing opponent was just 0.74%, is the level of domestic political support for a major foreign-policy shift.
Given South Korea’s winner-takes-all political system, in which presidents are limited to a single five-year term, many worry that any major foreign-policy changes could be summarily reversed as soon as 2027.
With the next presidential election not due until then, Yoon has time to secure such a consensus if he works hard at it.
So, as significant as South Korea’s strategic reorientation under Yoon appears to be, it will remain on shaky ground without more formal institutionalization, both in South Korea and among its allies, particularly Japan and the US.
That is why Yoon’s government, instead of waiting for Japan to make the first move (as is typical of South Korean diplomacy), has been reaching out and seeking to revive the warm ties that typified the relationship between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi from 1998 to 2000.
One must hope that this effort bears fruit soon.
But the strength of the bilateral relationship ultimately depends on the trilateral relationship between Japan, South Korea, and the US, and there are many more things that these three countries could be doing to deepen their ties.
Specialists at a trilateral conference organized by the Mansfield Foundation last summer proposed dozens of policy recommendations.
For example, meetings of the three countries’ defense and foreign ministers (“2+2+2 summits”) could be held regularly to build trust, improve policy coordination, and develop more effective responses to shared risks, such as the security threat posed by North Korea.
Joint trust-building initiatives could also be pursued in strategic research and development sectors such as next-generation semiconductors, aerospace technology, 5G and 6G communications, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.
The US National Science Foundation, the Japanese New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, and the National Research Foundation of Korea could all coordinate their efforts in these domains.
Equally important are deeper people-to-people ties among the three countries.
For example, exchange programs – especially for young people, media figures, and other “influencers” – could help to create a shared community and build greater public support for a deepening trilateral alliance.
More broadly, South Korea also will need to strengthen its participation in multilateral institutions and networks, so that it can work with other countries to provide international public goods, mitigate supply-chain problems, and address other global issues.
Perhaps the most important body that South Korea should seek to join is the group of Indo-Pacific democracies known as the Quad, comprising Australia, Japan, India, and the US.
While Quad members currently lack the political will to expand, the opportunity to tie South Korea to it should not be missed.
South Korea should also actively pursue membership in other vital multilateral international networks such as the G7; US President Joe Biden’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework initiative; the proposed Chip 4 Alliance (US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan), intended to strengthen control of and access to semiconductor production; and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the vast trans-Pacific trading bloc.
Strong, forward-looking South Korean and Japanese leadership will be needed to seize these opportunities, and to mobilize broader regional and global networks.
But, as is often the case, US leadership is needed to maintain today’s current momentum.
The 2022 US National Security Strategy calls for investment in US national power and alignment with allies and partners to out-compete China and constrain Russia.
But the Biden administration does not yet have an effective plan for uniting allies and like-minded countries behind shared security goals.
One reason for this is the traditional US failure to consider the impact of its domestic policies on its foreign-policy interests.
For example, France, South Korea, and others have been complaining loudly about being excluded from new US industrial policies (such as the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for US-produced electric vehicles).
While Biden has pledged to address these concerns, he must do so quickly.
Alliances, after all, are built on trust.
And trust will be the essential ingredient in shaping a security alliance worthy of Asia’s great democracies.

China’s New Emperor
HONG KONG – An anecdote about US President Richard Nixon’s visit to China in 1972 has long been regarded as confirmation of the long view of history taken by Chinese leaders.
Zhou Enlai, Mao’s dutiful number two, is said to have responded to a question about the lessons of the French Revolution by saying that it was too soon to tell.
In fact, according to diplomats who were there, Zhou was discussing not the revolution of 1789, but the 1968 student uprising in Paris, so it probably really was too soon to tell.
After this false start, lessons from the French Revolution have made a comeback in China.
Shortly after the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, it was reported that Alexis de Tocqueville’s The Old Regime and the Revolution, written in 1856, had become a “must-read” for senior CCP cadres.
The book’s merits were most enthusiastically touted by Wang Qishan, the man at the helm of President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign and perhaps Xi’s closest ally.
Toqueville argued that growing prosperity in eighteenth-century France had actually made it more difficult to govern the country.
As people became wealthier, they also became more aware of social and economic inequalities and thus increasingly resentful of the rich and powerful.
Attempts to reform the system only highlighted its vulnerabilities.
Revolution followed, sweeping away the monarchy and aristocracy. Their heads literally rolled.
The CCP’s just-completed 19th National Congress showed the extent to which China’s leaders have taken Toqueville’s insights to heart.
Xi asserted his undisputed authority over his party and country.
Xi consolidated his position during his first term, by reversing much of Deng Xiaoping’s legacy, including the opening of China’s economy, the separation of the CCP from government, and a low-key approach to foreign and security policy.
Xi has also swept aside potential rivals, relying primarily on his far-reaching anti-corruption campaign to target officials previously thought to be untouchable.
He has just overseen the largest-ever purge of the CCP Central Committee.
He has cracked down on even the most restrained criticism or signs of dissent, and has even banned Internet jokes, including memes comparing him to Winnie the Pooh.
In another country, such measures might trigger harsh reproach, with critics accusing Xi of turning his country into an old-school Leninist dictatorship.
In China, however, they have drawn praise from observers who believe that Xi is leading the way to the fulfillment of the “Chinese dream” to rejuvenate the country.
But, for some, the dream is on the verge of becoming a nightmare.
Demographic trends are threatening to turn the labor surplus that helped drive China’s rapid growth over the last few decades into a labor shortage at an unprecedented pace.
Water contamination and scarcity, alongside carbon dioxide emissions and lethal levels of air pollution, are imperiling people’s health and jeopardizing the sustainability of China’s economic performance.
Moreover, Chinese GDP growth, while welcome, is being fueled largely by a combination of fast-rising debt and widespread property bubbles.
Even Chinese researchers admit that their country has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world.
As the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, many are asking if this is what “socialism with Chinese characteristics” really means.
Of course, there is always an optimist around to offer a positive spin.
China owes most of its debt to itself, because political priorities guide lending as much as commercial considerations do.
China supports international efforts to address environmental degradation and climate change.
Most people are becoming better off, if unevenly.
And Xi’s administration is at least doing something to stamp out the endemic corruption in the CCP.
We should all hope that at least some of what China’s cheerleaders say is true; if Chinese growth collapses, the entire global economy will suffer.
But, even if the optimists are partly vindicated, Xi’s claim that China has found a better way to run a modern society and economy seems far wide of the mark.
To be sure, from the stupefying antics of US President Donald Trump to the damaging rise of populist nationalism in Europe, democratic countries are experiencing their share of trials.
But democratic systems have built-in stabilizing mechanisms that enable them to right themselves without resorting to violence or repression.
That is not the case in Xi’s China.
For years, there was a serious debate in China about the state’s proper role in economic affairs.
One camp maintained that if the CCP relaxed its grip on the economy, it would inevitably lose control of the state.
Others argued just the opposite: unless the Party ceded more economic control, it would lose political power, as the economy’s contradictions multiplied and development became less sustainable.
Xi clearly falls into the statist camp.
But it is not just the Party that Xi is empowering; he is also empowering himself.
In fact, it is hard to know who is ascending the CCP’s commanding heights and who will be struck down for disagreeing with the paramount leader.
This hasn’t deterred outsiders from speculating, but there is not much point in playing that guessing game.
Xi, like any other emperor, will continue to appoint courtiers who follow him wherever he leads.
But with great power comes great responsibility – and, at this point, Xi’s power is virtually absolute.
That is a heavy burden for one man.
Xi may be much smarter than Trump (not a high hurdle to clear), but that is not enough to guarantee a stable and prosperous future for China.
And, if things go wrong, everyone will know whom to blame.
There is a reason why dictatorial dynasties tend to end up the same way.
You don’t have to read Toqueville to know that.

Quantitative Easing for the People
OXFORD – It is now a near certainty that, by the end of this year, falling energy and commodity prices will push annual inflation in the eurozone below zero – well under the European Central Bank’s target of near 2%.
Rather than continue to allow misguided conventional thinking, centered on German economic ideology, to impede effective action, the ECB must pursue quantitative easing (QE) “for the people” – an adaptation of Milton Friedman’s “helicopter drops” strategy – to reverse deflation and get the eurozone back on track.
As it stands, conventional monetary policy has had – and American-style QE will have – little impact on the eurozone’s core countries.
This can be explained partly by the fact that, when it comes to credit provision, capital markets do far less of the heavy lifting in the eurozone (where banks matter more) than in the United States.
As a result, bringing down yields on government, corporate, and asset-backed bonds has less impact.
At the same time, the euro exchange rate – the one mechanism whereby current policies could still make a difference – cannot be pushed down much further.
For starters, given the eurozone’s huge trade surplus, doing so would incur strong international resistance.
Moreover, the mechanisms by which the US Federal Reserve’s purchases of asset-backed securities stimulate consumer spending – low mortgage rates, widely available home refinancing, high housing prices, and home-equity withdrawal – function differently in the eurozone.
In Germany, France, and Italy, higher house prices spur non-owners to save more for the down payment and inspire caution among tenants, who expect future rent hikes.
And the housing wealth of existing owners does not translate into significantly higher spending, given the lack of access to home-equity loans and cheap mortgage refinancing.
Finally, in countries like Germany, where households’ bank and saving deposits far outweigh their debt, lower interest rates reduce total household spending.
Another factor impeding QE’s impact in the eurozone is low bond yields, which, by increasing measured pension-fund deficits, make some companies reluctant to invest and thus more likely to raise contribution rates and limit pension benefits.
In the US, more generous assumptions regarding discount rates are used to calculate pension-fund liabilities.
Furthermore, US-style QE, in particular, tends to have adverse distributional implications, because it channels more money toward the wealthy, who have a lower propensity to spend, without providing much to the poorer people who would use it to consume more.
In the eurozone, the distribution issue is especially complex, given that institutional differences between countries can give the impression of discrimination among them.
Clearly, the ECB must develop a strategy that works in the eurozone’s unique system, instead of continuing to follow the Fed’s lead.
Such a strategy should be based on Friedman’s assertion that “helicopter drops” – printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public – can always stimulate the economy and combat deflation.
But, in order to maximize the impact of such an operation, the ECB would also have to find a way to ensure fair distribution.
One simple solution would be to distribute the funds to governments, which could then decide how best to spend them in their countries.
But the eurozone’s rule against using the ECB to finance government spending bars this approach.
A more feasible option, therefore, would be to provide all workers and pensioners with social-security numbers (or the local equivalent) with a payment from the ECB, which governments would merely assist in distributing.
Another alternative would be to use the electoral register, a public database that the ECB could use independently of governments.
Of the roughly 275 million adults with social-security numbers in the eurozone, some 90% are on the electoral register.
Extrapolating from America’s experience in 2001, when a $300 per person social-security rebate boosted spending by about 25% of the total amount distributed, a €500 ($640) check from the ECB could increase spending by about €34 billion, or 1.4% of GDP.
The extra tax revenue that such a rebate would produce would reduce government deficits significantly.
Beyond lifting the eurozone economy out of deflation, such an initiative would have massive political benefits, as it would reduce resentment toward European institutions, especially in struggling countries like Greece and Portugal, where an extra €500 would have a particularly strong impact on spending.
In this way, the ECB could prove to disgruntled citizens and investors that it is serious about meeting its inflation target, and even help to stem the rise of nationalist parties.
To be sure, some countries – especially Germany – are likely to resist this approach by marshaling arguments about prudence and responsibility.
But the fact is that “helicopter money” would work – and nothing in eurozone law prohibits it.
After years of austerity, infighting, and unemployment, it is time to implement a QE program that delivers what Europe needs.

Deconstructing the Euro
PARIS – In January, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at the economics research firm Markit, called France “the new sick man of Europe.”
With near-zero GDP growth, rising unemployment, and mounting public debt – not to mention counter-productive austerity policies – it is difficult to argue otherwise.
Given France’s profound importance to Europe’s economic and political stability, this poses a major threat to the entire European project.
Recent developments confirm Williamson’s diagnosis.
French business activity sank to a seven-month low in December.
While tax revenues increased by €32 billion ($44 billion) last year, the government deficit fell by a mere €8 billion and public debt increased from 89% of GDP to more than 93%.
Meanwhile, unemployment rose from 9.5% to 10.5%.
The obvious conclusion is that austerity is not the answer.
Indeed, France must abandon its current policies, for its own – and the rest of Europe’s – sake.
France’s problems, like those of the eurozone’s other troubled economies, stem from the fact that the euro’s exchange rate does not align with member countries’ economic positions.
As a result, these countries’ virtual exchange rates vis-à-vis Germany are critically overvalued, inasmuch as wages in these countries have risen more quickly, and labor productivity more slowly, than in Germany.
Given that the implicit nominal exchange rates are fixed “forever” within the euro, these countries have accumulated major deficits relative to Germany.
Likewise, the deficit countries’ exchange rates are overvalued relative to third countries like the United States and Japan, while Germany’s currency is undervalued, because the euro’s exchange rate is determined by the balance of payments of the eurozone as a whole, which Germany’s massive surplus distorts.
In short, the euro exchange rate is too weak for equilibrium in Germany and too strong for equilibrium in France and the other less competitive eurozone economies.
The eurozone’s weaker economies thus face a dilemma: either expand in line with productive potential, thereby incurring external deficits, or enforce austerity, eliminating external deficits by squeezing imports.
Under pressure from Germany, they have so far pursued the latter option.
The current “competitive austerity” trend is irrational, first and foremost, because, by undermining domestic demand, it directly controverts the currency union’s fundamental principle that a large domestic market should act as a buffer against external demand shocks.
This is causing everyone to suffer – even Germany.
Indeed, from 2007 to 2012, Germany’s exports to other eurozone countries declined by 9%, from €432 billion to €393 billion.
But this is not the only threat that austerity poses to Germany’s hard-won prosperity.
The euro has also caused Germany’s business cycle to diverge from those of the less competitive economies, while prohibiting customized monetary policies.
And the common monetary policy that all are being forced to pursue is intensifying deflationary pressures in the weaker countries, while increasing inflationary pressures in Germany.
Furthermore, populations in the eurozone’s stagnant economies are increasingly demanding that Germany change its policies, increasing wages and implementing measures aimed at boosting consumption and discouraging savings.
While responding to such demands would help to ease political tensions across the eurozone, they would face strong opposition within Germany.
Similarly, resolving the crises that will inevitably emerge from the current rigid exchange-rate system will ultimately require Germany to agree either to debt write-offs or to large-scale government-bond purchases by the European Central Bank, which would flood the eurozone with liquidity.
Either outcome would run contrary to Germany’s interests and preferences, making it as unfair an approach as austerity.
What the eurozone needs is a solution that does not force any one country or group of countries to bear the brunt of the adjustment – and that means a controlled segmentation of the currency union.
Contrary to popular belief, this could be done in a way that reinvigorates the European ideal, rather than reviving the parochial nationalism of the past.
The key is to ensure that it arises from the European Union’s economic and political core.
Specifically, Germany, Europe’s greatest economic power, and France, the intellectual progenitor of European unification, should announce their simultaneous exit from the euro and re-adoption of the Deutsche Mark and the franc.
This would trigger the immediate revaluation of the Deutsche Mark – and possibly of the franc – relative to the euro.
For their part, other EU member countries would have to decide whether to retain the euro in its truncated form or revert to their own national currencies, possibly pegging them to the revived Deutsche Mark or franc.
Regardless of their decision, the price competitiveness of the eurozone’s weaker economies would improve considerably.
Of course, France and Germany would need to implement interim arrangements to safeguard their banking systems’ stability.
Moreover, they would have to negotiate with the ECB and other European governments a plan for managing euro-denominated debts.
A period of monetary uncertainty, as European economies adjusted to the new environment, would be unavoidable.
But that would be far better than the economic and political impasse in which the eurozone is now trapped.

The Accidental Empire
NEW YORK – It is now clear that the main cause of the euro crisis is the member states’ surrender of their right to print money to the European Central Bank.
They did not understand just what that surrender entailed – and neither did the European authorities.
When the euro was introduced, regulators allowed banks to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds without setting aside any equity capital, and the ECB discounted all eurozone government bonds on equal terms.
Commercial banks found it advantageous to accumulate weaker countries’ bonds to earn a few extra basis points, which caused interest rates to converge across the eurozone.
Germany, struggling with the burdens of reunification, undertook structural reforms and became more competitive.
Other countries enjoyed housing and consumption booms on the back of cheap credit, making them less competitive.
Then came the crash of 2008.
Governments had to bail out their banks.
Some of them found themselves in the position of a developing country that had become heavily indebted in a currency that it did not control.
Reflecting the divergence in economic performance, Europe became divided into creditor and debtor countries.
When financial markets discovered that supposedly riskless government bonds might be forced into default, they raised risk premiums dramatically.
This rendered potentially insolvent commercial banks, whose balance sheets were loaded with such bonds, giving rise to Europe’s twin sovereign-debt and banking crisis.
The eurozone is now replicating how the global financial system dealt with such crises in 1982 and again in 1997.
In both cases, the international authorities inflicted hardship on the periphery in order to protect the center; now Germany is unknowingly playing the same role.
The details differ, but the idea is the same: creditors are shifting the entire burden of adjustment onto debtors, while the “center” avoids its own responsibility for the imbalances.
Interestingly, the terms “center” and “periphery” have crept into usage almost unnoticed.
Yet, in the euro crisis, the center’s responsibility is even greater than it was in 1982 or 1997: it designed a flawed currency system and failed to correct the defects.
In the 1980’s, Latin America suffered a lost decade; a similar fate now awaits Europe.
At the onset of the crisis, a breakup of the euro was inconceivable: the assets and liabilities denominated in a common currency were so intermingled that a breakup would have led to an uncontrollable meltdown.
But, as the crisis has progressed, the financial system has become increasingly reordered along national lines.
This trend has gathered momentum in recent months.
The ECB’s long-term refinancing operation enabled Spanish and Italian banks to buy their own countries’ bonds and earn a large spread.
Simultaneously, banks gave preference to shedding assets outside their national borders, and risk managers try to match assets and liabilities at home, rather than within the eurozone as a whole.
If this continued for a few years, a euro breakup would become possible without a meltdown, but it would leave the creditor countries with large claims against debtor countries, which would be difficult to collect.
In addition to intergovernmental transfers and guarantees, the Bundesbank’s claims against peripheral countries’ central banks within the Target2 clearing system totaled €644 billion ($804 billion) on April 30, and the amount is growing exponentially, owing to capital flight.
So the crisis keeps growing.
Tensions in financial markets have hit new highs.
Most telling is that Britain, which retained control of its currency, enjoys the lowest yields in its history, while the risk premium on Spanish bonds is at a new high.
The real economy of the eurozone is declining, while Germany is booming.
This means that the divergence is widening.
The political and social dynamics are also working toward disintegration.
Public opinion, as expressed in recent election results, is increasingly opposed to austerity, and this trend is likely to continue until the policy is reversed.
Something has to give.
In my judgment, the authorities have a three-month window during which they could still correct their mistakes and reverse current trends.
That would require some extraordinary policy measures to return conditions closer to normal, and they must conform to existing treaties, which could then be revised in a calmer atmosphere to prevent recurrence of imbalances.
It is difficult, but not impossible, to identify some extraordinary measures that would meet these tough requirements.
They would have to tackle the banking and the sovereign-debt problems simultaneously, without neglecting to reduce divergences in competitiveness.
The eurozone needs a banking union: a European deposit-insurance scheme in order to stem capital flight, a European source for financing bank recapitalization, and eurozone-wide supervision and regulation.
The heavily indebted countries need relief on their financing costs.
There are various ways to provide it, but they all require Germany’s active support.
That is where the blockage is.
German authorities are working feverishly to come up with a set of proposals in time for the European Union summit at the end of June, but all signs suggest that they will offer only the minimum on which the various parties can agree – implying, once again, only temporary relief.
But we are at an inflection point.
The Greek crisis is liable to come to a climax in the fall, even if the election produces a government that is willing to abide by Greece’s current agreement with its creditors.
By that time, the German economy will also be weakening, so that Chancellor Angela Merkel will find it even more difficult than today to persuade the German public to accept additional European responsibilities.
Barring an accident like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Germany is likely to do enough to hold the euro together, but the EU will become something very different from the open society that once fired people’s imagination.
The division between debtor and creditor countries will become permanent, with Germany dominating and the periphery becoming a depressed hinterland.
This will inevitably arouse suspicion about Germany’s role in Europe – but any comparison with Germany's past is quite inappropriate.
The current situation is due not to a deliberate plan, but to the lack of one.
It is a tragedy of policy errors.
Germany is a well-functioning democracy with an overwhelming majority for an open society.
When the German people become aware of the consequences – one hopes not too late – they will want to correct the defects in the euro's design.
It is clear what is needed: a European fiscal authority that is able and willing to reduce the debt burden of the periphery, as well as a banking union.
Debt relief could take various forms other than Eurobonds, and would be conditional on debtors abiding by the fiscal compact.
Withdrawing all or part of the relief in case of nonperformance would be a powerful protection against moral hazard.
It is up to Germany to live up to the leadership responsibilities thrust upon it by its own success.

Lucky Putin, Unlucky Yeltsin
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assertive foreign policy stance of recent years reflects the confidence that comes with a booming economy.
In 1999, the year before Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president, Russia’s GDP was a paltry $200 billion.
By last year, it had reached $1 trillion.
Real growth has averaged 7% for eight years, and real incomes have grown by roughly 10% per year.
Russia’s budget surplus has stood at more than 7% of GDP in the last two years, public debt has dwindled to only 8% of GDP, from 100% in 1999, and the current account surplus has averaged at 10% of GDP for the last eight years.
But Russia’s stellar economic performance has little to do with Putin’s policy, and a lot to do with the reforms Yeltsin embraced.
By 1998, Russia already had achieved a critical mass of markets and private enterprise, while the financial crash of that year worked like a catharsis, forcing the government to abolish enterprise subsidies that underpinned a devastating budget deficit of some 9% of GDP.
Moreover, world oil prices that had fallen to $10 a barrel started rising toward the stratosphere.
The whole success story thus was in place in early 1999, one year before Putin entered the stage.
To be sure, Putin should be praised for substantial economic reforms during his first three years.
A new tax code was adopted, with lower and fewer taxes, notably a flat income tax of 13%.
The civil code was completed, a new customs code was enacted, and substantial judicial reform was implemented.
At the same time, however, Putin has systematically eliminated the rudimentary democracy Yeltsin had build.
One television channel after another was taken over by the state under various pretexts, as were major newspapers.
Opposition candidates and parties were denied registration for the slightest formal complaint.
Falsification of elections became the rule.
Many prominent Russians favored the Pinochet model of authoritarian politics and liberal economics.
But growing authoritarianism also hit business.
In October 2003, Putin cracked down on Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the CEO and main owner of Yukos oil, Russia’s most valuable company, who was thrown into prison on dubious charges of tax fraud after backing Putin’s political opponents.
Moreover, Putin’s associates wanted Yukos’ wealth, which was confiscated by the state oil company Rosneft through lawless taxation, leaving Putin’s tax reform and judicial reform in tatters and severely undermining property rights.
In fact, since 2003, Putin’s main economic policy has been re-nationalization.
Well-run private companies have been more or less forced to sell out to state-dominated companies.
Gazprom is buying up oil (Sibneft), gas, and power companies at knockdown prices, reinforcing its monopoly.
That, in turn, allows Gazprom to boost its profitability through price increases, despite stagnant production.
Indeed, with state companies now producing one-third of Russia’s oil, output growth has plummeted, as owners of private enterprises – the source of dynamism in the sector – are now afraid to invest in new capacity.
Among foreign investors, both Shell and TNK-BP are being pushed out by Gazprom in their main gas fields in Russia.
Beyond oil and gas, Russia’s arms export agency, Rosoboronexport, has just seized Avtovaz, the giant dysfunctional Soviet car factory, and VSMPO-Avisma, Russia’s big titanium company, while all aircraft production has been concentrated in one state company.
The government cheers this re-nationalization, although it has reduced Russia’s industrial growth from 8.3% in 2004 to 4% in the last two years.
Similarly, inefficient state banks – far inferior to private banks even in Kazakhstan or Ukraine – dominate the banking system.
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank, for example, is on a buying spree, aggravating the quality of Russian banking.
Increasingly, Russia’s oil surpluses drive economic growth through rising investment, which boosts construction and consumption, in turn benefiting retail trade and finance.
With personal incomes rising strongly, poverty is declining, while 68% of Russia’s college-age youth now attend universities.
But other social indicators are unimpressive.
Life expectancy for men is stuck at 59.
The murder rate is even higher under Putin than it was under Yeltsin, as is the traffic death rate.
None of the big public systems – education, health care, or the military – has been reformed, and the regime shows little interest in doing so.
Instead, the Kremlin is preoccupied with the profitability and value of the state-dominated companies that it controls.
Not surprisingly, all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin, whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries.
Although corruption is pervasive, no top official has been prosecuted.
Putin and his KGB friends from St. Petersburg sit safely on all this wealth, thanks to their authoritarian governance and control over all security organs.
Such a powerful apparatus cannot retire to a quiet life in a dacha as Yeltsin did – it would have to privatize everything first – which implies that Putin has no choice but to remain in office, regardless of what he says about not seeking a third presidential term.
But if he holds on to power contrary to the constitution, his popularity could easily collapse, especially as his economic policy has thrived on luck, not reform.

The Power of Market Design
STANFORD – In 2010, the United States faced a challenging allocation problem.
Demand was surging for a resource vital to daily life, but the available supply was being used by incumbents that had built an important industry around it.
Moreover, incremental transfers to new uses were impossible.
Could new rules alleviate growing scarcities while respecting existing users’ rights and enabling a voluntary, multi-party reallocation?
The resource was not water but radio spectrum – the electromagnetic frequencies used for wireless phone calls, smartphone data, and emergency communications.
Demand for spectrum had grown as more people streamed movies, placed video calls, and used mobile apps.
But because spectrum that would have been ideal for smartphone apps was taken up by a fragmented industry of TV broadcasters, there wasn’t enough bandwidth for mobile uses.
Our company, Auctionomics, advised the US Congress and Federal Communications Commission to solve the problem through a series of changes culminating in the Broadcast Incentive Auction.
Spectrum would be bought back from less-valuable broadcast uses and resold for cellular applications, while generously protecting incumbents who wanted to continue their traditional uses.
That auction, held in 2016 and 2017, acquired a large amount of spectrum, reallocated it to higher-value uses, and raised $19 billion in gross revenue.
The success of this initiative demonstrates the power and potential of market design to create and refine marketplaces and exchanges to improve the allocation of scarce resources.
The auction design was integrated with important legislative changes that made spectrum rights more easily exchangeable while allowing incumbents to continue operating with little or no disruption.
This approach is widely applicable, especially in environmental management.
Additional new scarcities will require a reallocation of resources that pays close attention to both social and environmental challenges and the interests of existing users, who will resist changes they deem harmful.
Market design, which has emerged as an important subfield of economics in the past 25 years, provides new economic theory and related algorithms, evidence, and examples to help policymakers implement effective solutions.
Market design methods have already solved several important everyday problems of matching resources to users.
Applications include internet advertising (seeing online ads that are appropriate and match your interests), organ transplantation (finding a compatible donor for a loved one), medical residency matching (connecting newly minted doctors to their first job), and charitable food donations (stocking the local food bank with the most-needed items).
Policymakers can adapt the same theory and practices for new and evolving allocation problems.
For example, market design can help address COVID-19 vaccine shortages by allowing exchanges of the ingredients and supplies (such as filters, tubing, and pharma bags) needed for vaccine production.
Likewise, financial instruments using cryptocurrencies have introduced decentralized designs with fully automated trading.
Spectrum-license auctions will need to change again to accommodate 5G technologies and support small-scale Internet-of-Things and artificial-intelligence applications.
And the success of cap-and-trade programs – for carbon dioxide emissions, fisheries, and other environmental goods – will depend on how well regulators can define the products to be exchanged and set rules that encourage participation while achieving societal objectives.
Market design will also play a critical role in solving the problem of water allocation.
Many of the world’s existing rights to fresh water – both surface water and groundwater – have already been granted and grandfathered in complex ways to cities, farmers, and industrial users.
In some cases, each individual trade of these rights requires governmental approval; other jurisdictions prohibit such trading entirely.
These restrictions and historical rules have led to highly inefficient allocations.
Water may be unavailable to towns that require more of it as they grow, even when those urban and residential uses are a hundred times more valuable than the rural ones they would supplant.
Certain industrial firms whose rights are based on historical use may have an incentive to overuse water, even during droughts, to retain their rights to future allotments.
Where trading of rights is limited or prohibited, poor price signals make it difficult even to assess which uses are most valuable.
And water demand will increase and shift as climate change continues to upend historical usage patterns.
The success of the US radio spectrum auction points to a solution.
Instead of revoking incumbents’ spectrum rights unilaterally, Congress redefined them in a way that made trading them possible and simple, and then allowed TV broadcasters to decide for themselves whether to continue their previous uses or decline to participate.
The rights that were sold were then reconfigured to be suitable for new uses and efficient trading, while those that were unsold remained fit for existing purposes.
A similar reorganization of water rights could protect existing users not wishing to sell, while creating tradeable rights for others that would allow water to flow to its most valuable use.
Any attempt to compel all current users to participate will likely be thwarted by legal and political opposition, but a fully voluntary market styled on the same principles as the one for radio spectrum could accommodate resisters while drastically improving the allocation of water rights.
Moreover, policymakers could use a portion of the value freed by any reallocation to offset inequities – for example, by granting credits to rural towns or small agricultural producers so that they receive the water resources they need.
Allocating water efficiently and fairly will require innovation, collaboration, and regulation.
In this and other domains, market design puts practical economic theory in the service of establishing rights and introducing effective rules and algorithms.
That way, we can accommodate diverse market participants, harness new technologies, and maximize the public good.

Elon Musk’s Not-so-Hidden Agenda
NEW HAVEN – Why did Elon Musk purchase Twitter?
His official answer – to defend free speech and democracy – is so unconvincing that the question won’t go away.
Musk’s repeated appeals to these ideals to justify important decisions he has made since taking over are so confounding that they raise deep suspicions about his motives.
For example, Musk castigated the decision to remove former President Donald Trump’s account, arguing that “freedom of speech is the bedrock of a strong democracy.”
But Trump’s account was removed because he was using it to spread conspiracy theories about the election to a wide audience with increasingly violent language.
It’s difficult to imagine a more effective way to undermine democracy than to give the president of the United States a platform to claim that a free and fair election that he lost was “stolen.”
How would allowing Trump, still the leader of the Republican Party and the former leader of a democratic country, to use Twitter to attack democracy make democracy stronger?
A democratic system relies on widespread acceptance of the legitimacy of its rules.
This legitimacy is expressed, most obviously, in voting.
So, it is no accident that those seeking to destroy the legitimacy of democracy spread disinformation that undermines trust in the electoral system.
But there are other ways to undermine democratic legitimacy.
Democracy is based on political equality.
The most obvious expression of this is the principle of “one person, one vote.”
But political equality has a broader significance – it means that each of our voices can be heard.
As the philosopher Stephen Darwall has argued, in a democracy, it must be possible to speak truth to power.
Preserving democratic legitimacy thus means protecting a democratic information space – a domain of mutual trust in which citizens feel confident that they can debate and criticize freely on the basis of a shared consensus about reality.
There are well-established methods to undermine a shared sense of reality, and hence destroy the possibility of a democratic information space.
Giving a platform to powerful people who spread outrageous conspiracy theories is one of them.
There are plenty of others.
In their book Merchants of Doubt, historians Naomi Oreskes of Harvard and Erik Conway of Caltech showed how both the tobacco industry and the fossil-fuel industry funded research intended to spread doubt about the scientific consensus surrounding smoking and climate change.
The result was policy paralysis.
Undermining public trust by sowing illegitimate doubt destroyed the possibility of a democratic information space to deliberate about these issues.
Even if you are concerned about climate change, you may oppose efforts to mitigate it if you believe that the real agenda behind those efforts is a plot to subjugate humanity under an eco-totalitarian regime.
All that is needed to destroy the possibility of a democratic information space for particular political issues, such as climate change, is to provide a platform for, and give legitimacy to, would-be propagandists.
But it is possible to generalize this strategy – to target the possibility of democratic legitimacy tout court, by destroying the possibility of consensus on any issue.
To do so, one would need a platform that gave equal weight to all voices spreading conspiracy theories about every imaginable issue of public political concern.
Kremlin operatives attempted this with their RT television channel.
Musk is now attempting this strategy with Twitter.
It is clear why the fossil-fuel industry would want to undermine the possibility of democratically sanctioned action on climate change.
But why would the world’s richest man want to undermine the legitimacy of democracy itself?
The answer, by now, should be clear.
In a healthy democracy, a shared democratic information space allows everyone to speak truth to anyone.
This is the essence of political equality.
In a healthy democracy, a middle-class journalist can publish well-researched exposés of multinational corporations or spectacularly wealthy individuals that contribute to a popular consensus in favor of constraining their actions, increasing their taxes, or otherwise holding them to account.
If one destroys that information space by nurturing the spread of mass suspicion, it will no longer be possible to marshal citizens against the powerful in this way.
For powerful individuals, democratic legitimacy is a threat, because it is a check on their power.
Why wouldn’t one of the world’s most powerful individuals want to eliminate it?

Capitalizing on Climate Unity
BONN – When Donald Trump was elected US president a year ago, some said the end of the Paris climate agreement was nigh.
Yet, as the latest round of global climate talks in Bonn, Germany, has shown, the world’s political leaders are more committed to the deal than ever.
This is good news, but the fact remains that countries’ commitments do not yet add up to enough to turn the tide – and our window of opportunity to act effectively on climate change is rapidly closing.
Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States – the world’s largest historical carbon dioxide emitter – from the Paris agreement dealt the accord a major blow.
Many of America’s closest allies – including both of our countries, the Marshall Islands and Australia – were deeply disappointed by the move, which was shortsighted, for both America and the world.
But it is hard not to take heart from the fresh wave of global resolve Trump’s decision has unleashed, both globally and within the US itself.
Almost every major US state, city, and company has now pledged to do more to ensure that their country can meet its commitments, despite the Trump administration’s opposition.
The fact that climate action is now the worlds’ biggest economic opportunity has certainly helped.
According to the Trump administration’s own analysis, more than twice as many Americans are now working in the solar industry than in coal, oil, and gas combined.
And earlier this year, the OECD indicated that we could boost global growth by 5% per year by 2050, simply by linking the climate and growth agendas.
There is no time to waste; climate change has already arrived.
This year’s record-breaking drought in the Marshall Islands, apocalyptic storms in the Caribbean, and devastating floods in Bangladesh and the US demonstrate this.
As the United Nations Environment Programme recently reminded us, even if every country hits its existing 2030 emissions-reduction targets, we will be unable to limit warming to below 1.5° Celsius above preindustrial levels – the threshold, recognized in the Paris agreement, beyond which the impact of climate change becomes far greater.
Our chances even of staying within the more conservative – and dangerous – 2° Celsius limit will be slim.
To ignore this reality is to gamble with the existential future of many island countries, not to mention the prosperity of the global economy.
Without a sharp rise in global ambition for emissions reductions by 2020, we will be unable to save the world’s most vulnerable countries.
And if runaway climate change takes hold, no country will be immune to its effects.
Unfortunately, things will get a lot worse before they get better.
That is why we must step up our efforts to boost our resilience to the climate effects we won’t be able to avoid, and address the associated security consequences.
In the meantime, we must urgently increase the ambition of our climate commitments.
Fortunately, several upcoming events offer an opportunity to do just that.
We need to seize that opportunity with both hands.
Next month, French President Emmanuel Macron will host a conference to mark the two-year anniversary of the Paris agreement.
And next September, California Governor Jerry Brown will host his own summit to galvanize greater action by cities, companies, and other non-state actors.
The biggest opportunity, however, will come in 2019, when UN Secretary-General António Guterres convenes world leaders in New York for the biggest climate gathering since the Paris talks.
We need to build an arc of ambition across these events that can, in the words of our friend Tony de Brum, the late Marshallese foreign minister and untiring climate warrior at the Paris conference, deliver a pathway to survival for the most vulnerable.
Some significant players are already going above and beyond their pledges.
A number of others, including the Marshall Islands, are set to bring forward new targets by 2020, to augment their current targets, which reach only as far as 2025.
Still others – including France, India, and New Zealand – have said informally that they are eager to do more.
The truth is that almost all countries have the capacity to do more, especially if the support is there and the opportunities are identified.
The imperative now is to create the right political conditions both to motivate and facilitate action.
As more countries signal their ability to increase the ambition of their commitments, still more will follow.
At the same time, we must ensure that every sector, as well as every country, does its fair share.
This includes, for example, international shipping, which, if it were a country, would be the world’s sixth-largest emitter.
Next year’s “Talanoa Dialogue” – to be convened by Fiji, which last week became the first island state to chair UN climate talks – will help countries identify exactly how they can achieve the goals set in the Paris agreement.
That dialogue, which countries should approach in good faith, must be a springboard for further action.
To that end, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report laying out pathways for keeping the temperature rise below the 1.5°C threshold will be crucial.
The science remains key.
The Paris talks proved that political success is possible, if leaders are given the right platform, if civil society mobilizes behind them, and if the world acts in unison.
To get the rest of the way to a sustainable future, we must apply this lesson again.
The catchphrase at the Bonn conference was “further, faster, and together.”
Our collective challenge is to translate a nice-sounding slogan into reality.

The Return of Industrial Strategy
LONDON – Industrial policy is making a comeback in many advanced economies.
Dismissed out of hand in the go-go 1980s as a contributor to the previous decade’s stagnation, it is increasingly viewed as a means to stem working-class voters’ defection to right-wing populist parties.
But developing a modern and effective industrial strategy will be no easy feat.
The European Union has been trying to define a consistent framework for addressing the topic since 2014, when it published an analysis of industrial policy’s advantages and disadvantages.
The United Kingdom is further along, having released in January a green paper on building an industrial strategy.
US President Donald Trump has also focused on industrial policy, though his version would presumably entail substantial state intervention and protectionist measures.
Trump’s regressive vision, despite remaining short on details, already seems defective.
But Europe’s approaches to industrial strategy show some promise, not least because they are likely to eschew the broad interventions of the past that emphasized “picking winners.”
In the United Kingdom, for example, the government expects to focus instead on “targeted interventions” designed to create positive incentives, correct market failures, and address social, geographical, and sectoral imbalances.
Clearly, political leaders have learned some important lessons from history.
But serious problems remain.
Europe’s governments seem to think that they can implement ad hoc policies that strengthen their “invisible hand” today, and that those policies will somehow end up fitting neatly into a coherent framework.
That seems optimistic, at best.
The UK’s new plan does not even pinpoint the strategy’s main objective.
Is it to buttress GDP growth when the UK is no longer part of the European single market and customs union?
Or is it to boost the British economy’s potential output (that is, to increase long-term trend growth)?
The government’s plan mentions both objectives, but says little about how they will be balanced.
UK leaders must recognize that, where the strategy is aimed at strengthening post-Brexit growth, it will probably have to be set in the context of higher tariffs vis-à-vis the EU, which would remain Britain’s main market.
Such a strategy would also have to take into account the global competitiveness of British industry, and complement the country’s new independent trade policy.
At the same time, the British government must not get so caught up in preserving short-term growth and employment amid Brexit that it loses sight of the need to boost long-term growth potential.
Worryingly, however, the proposed strategy may over-emphasize ring-fencing the government’s own involvement in the economy.
While governments are right to shy away from picking winners, they must remain active in other ways.
Specifically, they must analyze which sectors and industries are more likely to contribute to long-term growth, and help to enable their success – potentially even in ways that imply real financial risks.
For example, governments should consider large infrastructure investments that have positive externalities – say, shorter commuting times, with their economic and social benefits – and that may be too large or too risky for the private sector.
This is particularly relevant where the government has access to a wider range of information than the private sector, strengthening its ability to optimize its investments.
Another component that is missing from current discussion of industrial policy in Europe is a clear timeline.
The reality is that a strategy developed today could take a generation to deliver results (think education reform).
So an effective industrial strategy must establish not only an overall timeframe, but also important milestones along the way.
In the UK’s case, those milestones should include shorter-term goals and outcomes associated with the Brexit process.
After all, an effective modern industrial strategy requires a careful accounting of the assets and resources, including human capital, that the economy will need in the coming years.
For the UK, such an accounting cannot be decoupled from Brexit.
In particular, UK leaders must identify which resources are tied to Europe’s single market, how they can be replaced, and how long that process will take.
The final critical element of an effective industrial strategy is the institutional framework on which it depends.
The UK government acknowledges the importance of creating the right institutions to address regional disparities.
But institutions must go beyond linking up sectors and regions to ensure transparency and accountability, especially in the relationship between the private and public sectors.
With that in mind, British leaders should reflect on which of the necessary institutions are already in place and which need upgrading.
It is important to resist the urge simply to shut down weak or inefficient institutions, and to consider, instead, how they can be reformed and strengthened.
Major changes are coming to the British and European economies.
Leaders must act now to define a comprehensive strategic vision that will enable them to cope with the challenges ahead.
That vision must be bold and ambitious.
Above all, it must be shared.
At a time of intensifying polarization, that may well be the hardest part.

From Russia With Unrequited Love
NEW DELHI – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has assiduously courted Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him more than a dozen times in four years.
This month he hosted Putin in Tokyo and in his hometown of Nagato (famed for its onsen, or natural hot springs).
But Abe’s courtship has so far yielded little for Japan, and much for Russia.
Abe’s diplomatic overtures to Putin are integral to his broader strategy to position Japan as a counterweight to China, and to rebalance power in Asia, where Japan, Russia, China, and India form a strategic quadrangle.
Abe has already built a close relationship with India, and he sees improved relations with Russia – with which Japan never formally made peace after World War II – as the missing ingredient for a regional power equilibrium.
But Abe’s trust-building efforts with Russia are not aimed only at checking Chinese aggression.
He also wants Russia to return its southernmost Kuril Islands – a resource-rich area known as the Northern Territories in Japan – which the Soviet Union seized just after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.
In exchange, Abe has offered economic aid, investments in Russia’s neglected Far East, and major energy deals.
Abe has, however, encountered several obstacles.
For starters, Japan is a participant in the US-led sanctions that were imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea in March 2014.
These sanctions have pushed Russia closer to its traditional rival, China; and Putin has publicly identified the sanctions as a hindrance to concluding a peace treaty with Japan.
In response to Abe’s overtures, Putin has doggedly tried to drive a hard bargain.
Russia has bolstered its defenses on the four disputed islands, and, just prior to this month’s summit, he told the Japanese media that the current territorial arrangement suits Russian interests.
“We think that we have no territorial problems,” he said. “It’s Japan that thinks that it has a territorial problem with Russia.”
The US-led sanctions regime and low oil prices have battered the Russian economy, which is expected to contract by 0.8% in 2016.
Thus, Putin is more reluctant than ever to offer territorial concessions, lest it tarnish his domestic image as a staunch defender of Russian national interests.
Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that Abe left the recent “onsen summit” with dashed hopes of resolving the territorial dispute, while Putin returned home with 68 new commercial accords.
Many of the new agreements are symbolic, but some are substantive, including deals worth $2.5 billion and an agreement to set up a $1 billion bilateral-investment fund.
Under the latter agreement, Japan and Russia are supposed create a “special framework” for joint economic activities on the disputed islands.
But the plan has already run into trouble.
Peter Shelakhaev, a senior Russian official who leads the government’s Far East Investment and Export Agency, has indicated that there are legal hurdles to establishing such a framework, and that Japanese firms doing business on the Kurils would have to pay taxes to Russia.
If Japan did that, however, it would effectively be recognizing Russia’s jurisdiction over the islands.
Abe has thus been denied the legacy that he sought, while Putin has succeeded in easing Russia’s international isolation.
Abe was the first G7 leader to hold a summit with Putin after Russia annexed Crimea, and now Russia has won Japan’s economic cooperation, too.
Japan is the only G7 country that has a territorial dispute with Russia, and it is clearly more eager to reach a deal than the Kremlin is.
But this has only strengthened Russia’s hand.
While Japan has softened its position, and signaled that it may accept only a partial return of the islands, Russia has grown only more intransigent.
After the recent summit, Abe revealed that Putin now seems to be reneging on a 1956 agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, which stipulates that the smaller two of the four islands will be returned to Japan after a peace treaty is signed.
As it happens, this year marks the 60th anniversary of that joint declaration, which was widely viewed as a breakthrough at the time.
The Kremlin is now suggesting that its commitment to fulfilling the declaration was conditional on Japan not joining any security alliance against Russia.
And Putin has expressed concerns that the 1960 Japan-US Security Treaty would extend to the disputed islands if they were returned, thus allowing the US to establish a military presence there.
Japan is in no position to address Russia’s concerns.
It cannot opt out of the US-led sanctions regime; and it cannot exempt the disputed Kurils from its security treaty with the US, especially now that it has been urging the US to provide an explicit commitment to defend the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, over which China claims sovereignty.
Putin, for his part, appears smugly content with his negotiating position.
Not only did he arrive almost three hours late to the onsen summit, in keeping with his habit of leaving foreign leaders waiting; he also declined a Japanese government gift – a male companion for his native Japanese Akita dog, which Japan gave him in 2012.
There is little hope now that Abe will see tangible returns on the political capital he has invested in cultivating Putin.
And Japan’s dilemma will only deepen.
US President-elect Donald Trump’s desire to improve relations with Russia may give Abe leeway to continue wooing Putin; but if Russia gets the US in its corner, it won’t need Japan anymore.

Intellectual Property and Economic Development
WASHINGTON, DC – In his recent State of the Union address, US President Barack Obama reiterated his ambition to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement among the US and 11 Pacific countries.
Meanwhile, the European Union and China are pressing to close their own deals in Asia and elsewhere.
If these proliferating trade pacts are to spur virtuous cycles of growth for developing countries, they must not only reduce trade barriers; they must also build the institutional framework of a modern economy, including robust intellectual property (IP) rights.
Some activists and government officials get the relationship between strong IP protection and economic growth backwards, claiming that IP rights are an obstacle to development, and thus should not be enforced until after countries achieve high-income status.
This attitude is particularly prevalent in India, which recently put trade negotiations with the EU on hold, and it was central to the failure of the Doha Round of global trade talks.
As Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma put it, “inherent flexibilities must be provided to developing countries.”
But the bottom line is that the ideas protected by IP rights are the dynamo of growth for developed and developing countries alike.
Instead of diluting IP rights, developing countries like India should recognize that strengthening IP protection is a prerequisite for attracting the foreign investment that they need to help their economies grow, create jobs, and improve their citizens’ capacity to consume.
Today, IP accounts for much of the value at large companies.
One study found that in 2009, across a variety of industries in the US, intellectual capital – patents, copyrights, databases, brands, and organizational knowledge – held a 44% share of firms’ overall market value.
Such companies have little desire to put their IP at risk of erosion or outright theft; they want to do business where they know that their IP is safe.
Developing countries have a lot to gain from attracting multinational firms.
Such companies bring technologically advanced imports and new management techniques that foster growth in domestic firms, while spurring industrial modernization.
They also spawn new local companies that serve as suppliers, thereby boosting employment, augmenting workers’ skills, improving productivity, and increasing government revenue.
Currently, India attracts a mere 2.7% of global spending on research and development; China, with its stronger IP rights, attracts close to 18%; and the US brings in 31%.
United Nations data show that India’s stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) was equivalent to just 11.8% of its GDP from 2010 to 2012 – far lower than the developing-economy average of roughly 30%.
According to a new study by the economists Robert Shapiro and Aparna Mathur, if India achieved Chinese levels of IP protection, its annual FDI inflows would increase by 33% annually.
In the pharmaceutical sector – which is particularly vulnerable to IP infringement – a stronger IP regime could increase FDI inflows from $1.5 billion this year to $8.3 billion in 2020, with pharmaceutical R&D doubling to $1.3 billion over the same period.
The increased FDI would create 18,000 new jobs in the pharmaceutical industry.
If India could transform its IP regime to resemble the US system, which is more robust than China’s, the benefits would be even greater.
Inward FDI could increase by as much as 83% annually by 2020; in the pharmaceutical industry alone, FDI could reach as much as $77 billion, with R&D rising to $4.2 billion and 44,000 new jobs being created.
The Indian government’s ongoing assault on pharmaceutical IP makes these findings even more significant.
Over the last two years, India has invalidated or otherwise attacked patents on 15 drugs produced by international firms in order to make way for local champions, claiming that exclusivity enables companies to charge high prices that harm consumers.
Allowing local producers to copy patented medicines, officials assert, will bring down prices and expand access.
But drug patents and prices are not the main – or even a major – obstacle to patients’ access to medical care in India.
The bigger issue, as the IMS consultancy found last year, is the shortage of doctors, clinics, and hospitals, especially in rural areas.
Even the public clinics and hospitals that do exist are often rendered useless by high rates of absenteeism by doctors.
Medicine, however affordable, is of no value if no one is available to prescribe or administer it.
Furthermore, Indians lack access to insurance programs, particularly for outpatient care.
This, coupled with the lack of a public safety net, makes health problems a leading source of economic hardship, even for middle-class families.
Far from improving citizens’ access to health care, weak IP protections are exacerbating India’s formidable health-care challenges.
It is time for India’s leaders to recognize the positive role that IP can play in fostering growth and improving citizens’ wellbeing.
It is equally important for trade negotiators worldwide to reject the notion that IP protection is a luxury that only rich countries can afford.
The reality is that IP protection is an economic engine that developing-country citizens should not have to forego.

Was the Stock-Market Boom Predictable?
NEW HAVEN – Should we have known in March 2009 that the United States’ S&P 500 stock index would quadruple in value in the next ten years, or that Japan’s Nikkei 225 would triple, followed closely by Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index?
The conventional wisdom is that it is never possible to “time the market.”
But moves as big as these, it might seem, must have been at least partly foreseeable.
The problem is that no one can prove why a boom happened, even after the fact, let alone show how it could have been predicted.
The US boom since 2009 is a case in point.
In looking at the US stock market, it is important to bear in mind that its participants are overwhelmingly US investors.
According to a US government study published last year, despite some growth between 2009 and 2017, the share of the US stock market owned by foreigners was still only about one-seventh in 2017.
But if all people heeded financial advisers’ counsel and were completely diversified, people outside the US, who held more than two-thirds of the world’s wealth as of last year, would own over two-thirds of the US stock market as well.
Home-country bias, or patriotism, is a big factor in the stock market.
So, to understand the US stock market’s strength, we need to consider the thinking of its participants.
There seems to have been an overreaction in the US to a temporary drop in earnings.
S&P 500 earnings per share had been negative (a very rare event) in the fourth quarter of 2008, both for “reported earnings” and for “operating earnings,” and those numbers were just coming in around March 2009, when the index reached its nadir.
You might think that an intelligent observer in the US in 2009 would have recognized that the decline was temporary, and would have expected earnings – which are relevant to forecasting long-term growth of stock prices – to recover.
But the real question is whether the observer could have based a very optimistic forecast for long-term earnings growth on the rebound from that negative earnings moment.
We now know that long-term measures of earnings growth did not change a lot.
Ten-year average S&P 500 earnings per share from 2009 to 2019 were up only 71% from the previous decade.
The quadrupling in the S&P 500 price index was thus driven not by higher earnings but by much higher valuations of earnings.
It is true that real interest rates are down since 2009, with the ten-year US Treasury Inflation-Protected Security yielding 0.8% in February, down from 1.71% in March 2009.
But all of that decline occurred by 2010 and could not justify any of the strong uptrend in stock prices since then.
In 2009, some people in the US were using very strong language to express their fear.
One heard that a “financial supernova” was coming.
A ProQuest News & Newspapers search for “derivatives” and “financial weapons of mass destruction” (a phrase attributed to Warren Buffett) shows that these two terms first appeared together in 2003 and gained intense popularity by 2009, only to fade to near nothing by 2018.
Those who were prescient enough to know that derivatives markets weren’t going to blow up the economy might have known that any drag on the market from the fear that they would could not be sustained for ten years.
But a forecast based on such prescience is hard to quantify or defend publicly.
The fact that economists on the whole had not predicted the 2008 financial crisis was much emphasized at the time and led to some lost faith.
Many people were worrying in March 2009 that stocks had a lot further to fall.
Under my direction, the Yale School of Management has been collecting data on the opinions of both institutional and individual investors in the US since 1989.
One of the questions is: What do you think is the probability of a catastrophic US stock-market crash, like that of October 28, 1929 or October 19, 1987, in the next six months, including a crash caused by financial contagion from other countries?
In early 2009, the percentage of people who gave a probability greater than 10% reached a record high (since 1994).
Likewise, ProQuest News & Newspapers counts of the frequency of the phrase “Great Depression” soared to unprecedented heights.
There were more mentions of “Great Depression” in 2009 than there were during the Great Depression.
But then, with no stock-market crash and no extreme depression in sight, these fears were replaced by their opposite: deeper admiration of business success.
A new narrative emerged, featuring a new wave of billionaire geniuses whose appearance in the 1990s was interrupted only briefly by the financial crisis.
The publication in 2011 of the number-one best seller Steve Jobs,Walter Isaacson’s biography of the Apple founder, is one example.
Elon Musk has stirred excitement with futuristic companies such as aerospace manufacturer SpaceX and Neuralink, which is developing implantable brain-computer interfaces.
The accession of a flamboyant businessman, Donald Trump, to the US presidency is evidence of the strength of many Americans’ identification with business heroes.
Starting in 2004, Trump spent much of his time developing his business persona as the star of the reality TV show The Apprentice, and then, from 2008, The Celebrity Apprentice.
His campaign marshaled this enthusiasm, and his claim that he would “Make America Great Again” appealed to the optimism of US investors.
The quadrupling of US stock prices since 2009, as well as Trump’s election, thus appears to reflect, at least in part, a process of fear abatement and re-enchantment with American business culture.
But it is hard to forecast such trends – even the biggest – in the stock market, not only because forecasting is a highly competitive business, but also because spontaneity plays such an important role in human behavior.

The Asian Sleepwalkers
SEOUL – Whether East Asia’s politicians and pundits like it or not, the region’s current international relations are more akin to nineteenth-century European balance-of-power politics than to the stable Europe of today.
Witness East Asia’s rising nationalism, territorial disputes, and lack of effective institutional mechanisms for security cooperation.
While economic interdependence among China, Japan, South Korea, and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations continues to deepen, their diplomatic relations are as burdened by rivalry and mistrust as relations among European countries were in the decades prior to World War I.
One common characteristic, then and now, is a power shift.
Back then, Great Britain’s relative power was in decline, while Germany’s had been rising since German unification in 1871.
Similarly, at least in terms of economic, if not military, capability, the United States and Japan seem to have begun a process of decline relative to China.
Of course, this process is not irreversible: Effective political leadership and successful domestic reforms in the US and Japan, together with China’s failure to manage political pressure from below, could yet halt this seemingly inexorable power shift.
Major power shifts define eras in which key political leaders are likely to make serious foreign-policy mistakes.
Indeed, poor management of international relations at such critical junctures has often led to major wars.
Rising powers tend to demand a greater role in international politics, declining powers tend to be reluctant to adjust, and key policymakers are likely to misunderstand the intentions of other countries’ leaders and overreact to their actions.
Historically, rising powers tend to become too confident too soon, leading them to behave imprudently, which frightens their neighbors.
For example, Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Otto von Bismarck as chancellor in 1890, less than 20 years after the formation of the Second Reich, and began to destroy Bismarck’s carefully crafted alliance network.
His rough diplomacy frightened France, Britain, and Russia, making it easier for them to unite against Germany.
China’s new diplomatic assertiveness in 2010 – closely following the eruption of the worst financial crisis since the 1930’s – recalled that of Wilhelmine Germany.
In both cases, insecurity resulted not from an external threat, but from top policymakers’ own actions.
In late 2010, I was relieved – somewhat – when a key Chinese leader, State Councilor Dai Bingguo, announced that China would adhere to the path of peaceful development.
But the rhetoric of some Chinese, particularly in the military, concerning the South China Sea and other disputed Chinese sovereignty claims suggests that not everyone in the country’s leadership is committed wholeheartedly to such a path.
The extent to which policymaking by the country’s new leader, Xi Jinping, takes into account the insecurity felt by China’s neighbors – and abandons a quest for absolute security for China – will be one of the key variables influencing East Asia’s security environment in the years ahead.
America’s foreign policy will be another key factor.
If the US pursues a predominantly confrontational approach, East Asian politics will inevitably become polarized, just as multipolar nineteenth-century Europe gave way to an increasingly bipolar order in lockstep with rising tensions between Germany and Britain.
America’s so-called “pivot to Asia” might have been necessary from its point of view, given the concerns of its Asian allies about China.
But, unless the US wants a Cold War-style confrontation in Asia, it must try harder to engage China in shaping a viable regional security structure.
A confrontational US approach toward China, moreover, would imply an additional destabilizing factor: Japan might become much bolder than necessary in its foreign policy.
After Wilhelm II stopped engaging Russia in the 1890’s, bilateral relations worsened, which provided his ally, Austria, diplomatic carte blanche in dealing with Serbia – and, more important, Serbia’s Russian patron.
Thus, Wilhelm unintentionally contributed to the outbreak of war in 1914.
There are already some worrying signs of a Japanese miscalculation.
Japan’s new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, reportedly said that he is considering renouncing the Kono Statement of 1993, which acknowledged that the Japanese military had raped and enslaved Asian and European women during World War II.
If Abe does so, Japan’s relations with South Korea and China will suffer serious damage.
That is in no one’s interest, including Japan’s, given that the Japanese share many security concerns with South Korea.
So US diplomacy will need to be dexterous.
It must ease Japan’s sense of insecurity in the wake of China’s rise, while persuading Japan’s new leaders to behave prudently and refrain from excessively nationalist behavior.
Frankly, with two decades of economic stagnation already behind it, Japan has more important matters to pursue.
In contrast to its multilateral efforts in Europe, the US created a hub-and-spoke security framework – formed by US-centered bilateral alliances – in Asia following WWII.
One result is that no direct channel for security cooperation among Asian countries was ever established, which has contributed to the low level of trust in East Asia, even among close US allies like Japan and South Korea.
And it is precisely here that South Korea, a medium-sized ally of the US, will be in a better position than Northeast Asia’s bigger powers to act as a facilitator.
There is much to learn from the diplomatic failures that led to WWI.
A new history, by Christopher Clark, of the diplomatic prelude to that war is called, fittingly, The Sleepwalkers.
The question for the US and East Asia’s leaders today is whether they will wake up and develop effective multilateral mechanisms for security cooperation before doing themselves serious harm.

Why Are Governments Paralyzed?
MILAN – It is no secret that the global economy is struggling.
Europe is in the midst of a crisis whose root cause is a structurally flawed monetary and economic union.
The United States, emerging slowly from a financial crisis and widespread deleveraging, is experiencing a growth slowdown, a persistent employment problem, an adverse shift in income distribution, and structural challenges, with little effective or decisive policy action.
Meanwhile, among the major emerging economies, China’s reform process is on hold, pending a leadership transition this fall that will clarify various internal interests’ goals and power relationships.
India, which has lost reform momentum, is experiencing an economic slowdown and a potential loss of investor confidence.
The negative effects of these problems are now interacting, feeding back on themselves, and spreading to the rest of the global economy.
And yet, despite a palpable sense of concern that something is very wrong, the prognosis for significant change is bleak – and deteriorating.
What accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions?
One line of thinking blames a “leadership vacuum” – a common diagnosis in Europe.
Elsewhere – especially in the US – polarization and ugly zero-sum politics are thought to discourage potentially capable political leadership.
But, absent further analysis, the leadership vacuum becomes a catchall explanation.
What we need to know is why new political leadership in democracies like France, Britain, Japan, and the US has produced so little change.
A second explanation addresses that question: While bold action is required, the complexity of economic conditions, and disagreement about the right policy responses, implies a risk of serious error.
For professional politicians and policymakers in such circumstances, less may be more.
On this view, risk aversion both reflects and reinforces a divergence between individual incentives (the desire to be reelected, reappointed, or promoted) and collective needs (fixing problems).
A third answer is that policy instruments are simply ineffective in today’s conditions.
There is some merit to this claim.
Economic deleveraging takes time.
The restoration of sustainable patterns of growth requires years, not months.
Expectations may be out of line with the underlying reality.
But the absence of a quick solution does not mean that nothing can be done to improve the speed and quality of recovery.
Vested interests may also play a role.
Technological innovation and global market forces have produced a decisive shift in income toward capital and the upper 20% of the income distribution, often at the expense of middle-income groups, the unemployed, and the young.
The beneficiaries of these trends may have accumulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo, highlighting distributional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence.
There are structural explanations for policy inaction as well.
Governance systems and constitutional structures differ in the extent to which they require broad consensus for official action, or to change policy direction in response to shocks or shifting conditions.
Some argue that the more constraining political systems work well in stable times, but perform poorly under volatile conditions like those prevailing today.
Others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste, rent-seeking, and interference with freedom of choice, and that, when needed, inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances.
High hurdles to major shifts in policy direction force officials to make a convincing case.
That is an inherently difficult task at a time when rapid change in the global economy has left many still trying to understand what is happening and what it all means for growth, stability, the distribution of income, and employment.
In the face of such complexity, it is not surprising that genuine policy disagreements lead to extended debate and relatively little action.
Moreover, the technocratic elements of government must often be balanced against democratic accountability.
In every society, individuals with special training and expertise are appointed to perform technically complex functions.
Their freedom of action is constrained by time limits and reappointment procedures that determine the nature and degree of their accountability to elected officials and the public.
There can be too little freedom of action (populism) or too little accountability (autocracy).
The necessary balance may vary according to local conditions.
For example, many China observers believe that accountability there needs to increase at this stage of the country’s economic, social, and political evolution.
Others argue that Western democracies have the opposite problem: a surfeit of narrow, politically assertive interests leads to underinvestment and poor tradeoffs between present and future opportunities and performance.
This brings us to a crucial obstacle: Government, business, financial, and academic elites are not trusted.
Lack of trust in elites is probably healthy at some level, but numerous polls indicate that it is in rapid decline, which surely increases citizens’ reluctance to delegate authority to navigate an uncertain global economic environment.
Loss of trust probably has multiple causes, including analytical failure: central banks, regulators, market participants, rating agencies, and economists almost all failed to detect rising systemic risk in the years preceding the current crisis, much less to take appropriate corrective action.
But a more important cause is a suspicion that elites are placing their own interests above shared social values.
Claims that our leadership, institutions, analyses, or policy instruments are inadequate to the task at hand surely contain a kernel of truth.
But the deeper problem is a breakdown in precisely such values and goals – that is, a weakening of social cohesion.
Restoring it will require analysts, policymakers, business leaders, and civil-society groups to clarify causes, share blame for mistakes, pursue flexible solutions in which costs are shared equitably, and, most important, explain that hard problems cannot be solved overnight.

Bringing the Chinese Consumer to Life
BEIJING – History will be the ultimate judge, but there is good reason to believe that China’s recently completed Third Plenum will come to be regarded as a pivotal moment in the country’s development.
At long last, China’s senior leadership has endorsed a raft of reforms that could impel the economy’s shift from reliance on exports to consumption-led growth.
Until now, this transformation was framed in terms of broad goals and aspirations.
For example, the 12th Five-Year Plan, adopted in March 2011, promised the emergence of a consumer-led economy, resting on the building blocks of urbanization and the development of an embryonic services sector.
Notwithstanding the importance of these commitments in setting out opportunities for China’s middle class, they lacked a critical component: incentives for Chinese families to convert their newfound income into discretionary consumption.
On the contrary, financial and economic insecurity has gripped Chinese households since the “iron rice bowl” – the cradle-to-grave support that the socialist state offered workers and their families – was discarded in the late 1990’s.
Fearing for the future, households have hoarded incremental income, rather than spending it on consumer goods.
Economists call that precautionary saving.
China’s leaders called it frustrating.
The reforms endorsed by the Third Plenum focus on this wedge between income and consumption, offering specific proposals aimed at altering the behavior of fear-driven Chinese families.
Especially important is the proposal to channel 30% of the profits of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – currently running at close to $400 billion – into the country’s woefully under-funded social safety net.
China’s national health-insurance plan, for example, boasts nearly universal coverage, but the benefits it provides are negligible.
The same is true of China’s retirement system: the workforce’s enrollment rate is around 50%, but only $600 of assets per worker (in national, local government, and private pension schemes, combined) are available to cover lifetime retirement benefits.
Little wonder that Chinese families, fearful of such an uncertain future, save to excess.
An adequately funded safety net could go a long way in tempering the expectations underlying this behavior.
Several other measures proposed at the Third Plenum seek to shift Chinese families’ behavioral norms.
A major reconsideration of the one-child policy is especially important, given the need to relieve pressures arising from the inevitable decline in China’s working-age population.
Reform of the hukou (residency permit) system to allow citizens to transfer their welfare benefits from one city to another is vital for an increasingly flexible labor force that now includes almost 200 million migrant workers.
China’s consumers should also draw comfort from the likely move to market-based deposit rates on their savings accounts, which will reinforce incremental growth in wage income.
This long overdue policy shift is an important component of the Third Plenum’s official elevation of market-based pricing as the “decisive” mode of resource allocation in China.
The word “decisive” holds important implications for key resources – including fuels, financial capital, and, of course, the currency – that historically have been subject to state-administered pricing.
Rhetorical flourishes have always been an important signaling mechanism for major policy changes – think of Deng Xiaoping’s “reforms and opening up” of the late 1970’s.
The Third Plenum’s use of “decisive” to anchor a market-based approach is a similar gambit.
All of this casts modern China’s development strategy in a new light.
Beginning with Deng in the late 1970’s, scientists and engineers – technocrats with the determination to convert a dysfunctional centrally planned economy into an investment- and export-led colossus – framed and implemented a producer-oriented development model.
Today, the task at hand is very different: to transform the technocratic framework of the producer model into the aspirational vision of a flourishing consumer society.
The need to navigate this shift raises the toughest question of all: Is the new “fifth-generation” Chinese leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping, up to the challenge?
There are three reasons to believe that it is.
First, the role of technocrats in China’s senior leadership is on the wane.
Research by Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution reveals that only about 15% of the current 25 Politburo members are engineers and scientists, down from 40% in 2007 and 72% in 2002.
Li’s analysis points to the related ascendance of senior officials trained in law and the social sciences – providing a skill set that is more closely aligned with the vision of a consumer society.
Second, the Third Plenum established a new high-level organization – the so-called Central Leading Group on Reforms.
This small group, likely to be headed by Xi, will play the key role in drafting specific guidelines for implementing the Plenum’s proposed reforms – thus threatening to marginalize the long-dominant technocrats of the National Development and Reform Commission, the heir to the old State Planning Commission.
Finally, Xi’s power base is far broader than that of his two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, both of whom had shaky transitions in the first years of their leadership.
Unlike Jiang and Hu, Xi assumed quick command of the Chinese Communist Party, the government, and the military, and very effectively shepherded the Third Plenum’s historic reforms.
As always, proof will come only with implementation.
But with China’s leaders now focusing squarely on aligning the vast population’s behavioral norms with the next phase of transformation, the case for a consumer-led China has become more compelling than ever.

Europe’s Shaky Foundations
BERLIN – Slowly, word is getting round – even in Germany – that the financial crisis could destroy the European unification project in its entirety, because it demonstrates, quite relentlessly, the weaknesses of the eurozone and its construction.
Those weaknesses are less financial or economic than political.
The Maastricht Treaty established a monetary union, but the political union that is an indispensable precondition for the common currency’s success remained a mere promise.
The euro, and the countries that adopted it, are now paying the price.
The eurozone now rests on the shaky basis of a confederation of states that are committed both to a monetary union and to retaining their fiscal sovereignty.
At a time of crisis, that cannot work.
At the beginning of the crisis, in 2007-2008, the eurozone’s fundamental flaws could have been corrected had Germany been willing to support a joint European crisis response.
But German officials preferred to maintain national primacy – and thus a confederational approach to Europe.
Throughout history, confederations have never really worked, because the question of sovereignty (and thus of power and legitimacy) remains unresolved.
The United States is a case in point.
After winning independence, the American colonies united loosely under the Articles of Confederation.
But that arrangement failed financially and economically, and the US soon moved towards a full federation.
Today, Europe – or, more precisely, the eurozone – faces an almost identical situation, except that the historical conditions for further integration are much more complex and difficult than they were in post-independence America.
Europe has three choices.
Muddling through as before would only escalate and prolong the crisis.
Ending the monetary union would end the European project itself, and wreak unmanageable havoc.
Finally, Europe could move forward to real economic and political integration – a step that today’s leaders lack the confidence to take, because they don’t believe that they have the necessary public support at home.
Much, therefore, speaks for starting with a combination of the first and second options.
Then, once the European project is halfway over the cliff, the federalist moment might arrive.
But the operative word is “might”: a headlong plunge into the abyss might prove equally likely.
Europe’s do-nothing approach to the crisis has already produced visibly adverse consequences.
Elected officials’ passivity has stoked popular mistrust, which now threatens the European project.
Indeed, the crisis is beginning to erode the very foundations – the Franco-German and transatlantic partnerships – of a post-war European order that has ensured a period of peace and prosperity without precedent in the history of the continent.
Financial-market pressure has now reached France, and poses a danger that is far from over.
If France is brought to its knees and Germany doesn’t stand by its partner unwaveringly and with everything that it has to offer, the European catastrophe will be complete.
And that could happen sooner rather than later: France cannot and will not give up on the Mediterranean region, so the exit fantasies entertained by rich northern Europeans (Germans, above all) endanger the Franco-German pillar of European peace.
Across the Atlantic, America’s fiscal crisis and weak economic growth will force it to reduce its global military commitments.
Moreover, the US will orient itself increasingly towards the Pacific rather than the Atlantic.
For Europeans, with our turbulent eastern and southern neighborhoods, this presents an additional security challenge for which we are materially and intellectually unprepared.
Even today, Europe’s military weakness is working to undermine the transatlantic relationship.
An additional threat to the transatlantic alliance arises from the emerging new world order.
The coming years, indeed decades, will be characterized by an increasingly aggressive US-Chinese dualism as China becomes stronger and America’s weakness persists.
While this rivalry will have a military component, as evidenced by China’s enormous military buildup, it will manifest itself primarily in terms of economic, political, and normative spheres of influence.
East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific will play the central role here.
But China will try to draw Europe into this new global game.
Indeed, it has already begun to do so.
The recent visits by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to Europe’s crisis countries, to which he offered generous loans and assistance, made this strikingly clear.
And America’s weakness, the growing dependence of European (especially German) exports on the Chinese market, and the enticements of the Far East more generally, will nurture a new and promising Eurasian perspective as Transatlanticism declines.
European illusions about Asia will no longer be directed at Russia, which, apart from its natural resources, will simply have nothing to offer.
No, this time, the temptation will spring from China, which well understands Europe’s significance in its emerging geopolitical contest with (and against) the US.
As with Germany vis-à-vis France, here, too, Europe must stand unwaveringly by its transatlantic partner to avoid putting itself in great jeopardy.
The two foundations of Europe’s seven decades of peace are cracking.
Repairing them requires nothing less than pressing ahead, at long last, toward a strong, united Europe.

Boards on Their Backs
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent governance controversy at JPMorgan Chase has masked a much larger issue.
Regardless of Jamie Dimon’s victory in retaining his dual role as CEO and chairman of the board, the more important failure on display was that of the board of directors itself – a problem that affects almost all of the world’s megabanks.
This is completely obvious at JPMorgan Chase.
The report of the recent bipartisan investigation, led by US Senators Carl Levin and John McCain, into the infamous “London Whale” trades provides just one example.
There is also the litany of complaints and legal cases now surrounding the firm.
It is difficult to see JPMorgan Chase escaping its past anytime soon.
But the problem is much broader: Not a single global megabank has a well-functioning board.
Their members kowtow to CEOs, do not examine management decisions closely, and, with very few exceptions, rubber-stamp compensation requests.
Big banks’ boards are supine for three main reasons.
First, and most important, there is no market for control over the biggest banks.
One cannot build up a significant shareholding and use it to put pressure on boards – let alone pursue a hostile takeover.
The London Whale is a case in point.
The pressure brought to bear on JPMorgan Chase was completely inconsequential – nothing significant will change.
This is primarily because regulators – despite what they may claim – effectively protect megabanks from market discipline.
“Systemic importance” has become an excuse for maintaining impenetrable entry barriers (yet another reason why executives want their firms to be regarded as too big to fail).
Second, most board members lack sufficient relevant expertise.
Who on the current board of JPMorgan or Citigroup has real experience running a giant complex trading operation (which is what will make or break these companies over the next decade)?
Who among them understands macroeconomic risks not in terms of the platitudes of the prevailing consensus, but as the tail risks – the low-probability, high-impact events – that always wag the dog of financial crisis?
Unqualified board members do not ask hard questions.
And, five years after the largest financial crisis in almost 80 years, one can count the number of properly qualified board members – across all megabanks – on the fingers of one hand.
As a result, megabanks’ senior managers are not pressed to remove layers of opaqueness that shield their risk-taking from effective scrutiny.
This helps to keep board members in the dark – and gives them a convenient excuse for not really understanding how the business works.
Effective governance is possible under various formal arrangements.
In principle, a strong outside lead director can be just as effective as an independent chairman – a fair point that has been made in recent weeks.
But which huge banking conglomerate has such a lead director today?
Which board members are willing and able to stand up to CEOs?
That has certainly not been the recent experience at JPMorgan Chase.
Finally, regulators, too, have been rendered docile in the face of the megabanks’ CEOs.
Regulators have the power to require that boards become more powerful – or at least minimally effective.
For example, they could tighten the qualifications needed to become a bank director (in the United States, for example, the requirements are not serious).
Instead, regulators stand idly by while bank boards remain self-perpetuating clubs, with membership regarded as little more than so much social plumage.
The regulators acquiesce because, simply put, they are afraid.
Mostly, they are afraid that being tough on bank governance will somehow disrupt the flow of credit.
It is a silly and baseless fear, but that is how modern regulators think and act – in a state of constant, irrational anxiety.
The banks in question are so large and so central to the functioning of economies that each of them is too big to regulate.
Whenever small groups of individuals acquire that much power relative to the state and the rest of us, there is big trouble ahead.
Power corrupts, and financial power corrupts the financial system.
The biggest banks were badly run in the years leading up to the crisis of 2008 – exhibiting a toxic mixture of hubris, incompetence, and excessive leverage – and their governance problems today are worse than they were in 2005 or 2007.
The 2008 crisis was followed by a long, hard recession; we should not expect a different scenario now.

The Continuing Mystery of Life’s Building Blocks
GARRISON, NEW YORK – Imagine for a moment that you have come across a trove of marvelous devices left by an ancient civilization.
These mysterious instruments vary widely in size and complexity, but they all share a few wondrous capabilities.
If you want to understand how they work, it makes sense to start with the simplest and smallest device, then systematically carve off pieces until it stops working.
Eventually, everything that is inessential will be gone, and you will be left with only the components necessary for it to perform its basic functions.
And then, once you figure out what each of those pieces does, you will have your answer.
This is roughly the journey of discovery that the American biotechnologist J. Craig Venter and his colleagues have been taking for the past two decades – only their marvelous devices are not archeological remains, but living organisms.
And the pieces they are trying to understand are the genes that we share with all other forms of autonomous, reproductive life.
In a recent paper in the journal Science, Venter and his colleagues announced that they had created the smallest living and reproducing organism.
Their creation – called JCVI-syn3.0 – is a simple cell, with only the genes that are essential for life; it has a smaller genome than any autonomously replicating organism found in nature, larger only than those found in viruses and other entities that rely on hosts for essential functions.
Venter and his team created their organism through a process of trial and error.
They began by using their knowledge of biology to deduce the minimum set of genes that would be required for life.
That approach failed.
So, instead, they took an existing organism and began to whittle it down.
They started with the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, a parasitic bacteria that infects cattle and goats, and also a close relative of Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the fewest genes – just 525 – known among free-living bacteria.
The team broke the M.mycoides genome into eight fragments and began deleting genes one by one.
If the reconstructed organism failed to thrive, the gene was left in. If it did not appear to matter, it stayed out.
In the end, 473 genes were required for the organism to thrive.
(Humans, by comparison, have roughly 20,000 genes.)
The most important result of the Venter team’s work was to reveal how little we know about the basic biology of life.
Most of the 473 genes take care of housekeeping: They make proteins, keep DNA in good repair, and are responsible for the cell’s membrane and cytoplasm.
But there are 149 genes whose function is unknown.
In other words, the purpose of nearly one-third of the genes needed to keep the organism alive, well, and reproducing remains a mystery.
Of the 149 genes with unknown functions, 70 have a structure that at least hints at their role in the cell.
But we know nothing about the other 79, except that in these organisms, in this environment, life is impossible without them.
Moreover, as Venter and his colleagues acknowledge, if the team began with a different microbe, or grew it in a different environment, the set of necessary genes would be different.
So their genome is a minimal genome, not the minimal genome.
All of this implies many exciting discoveries ahead.
And yet, when it comes to practical, commercial objectives, the news is considerably more sobering.
One of the primary goals of synthetic biology has been to create a platform, or chassis, to use as a foundation for building organisms designed for specific tasks.
Just as Volkswagen uses its A5 platform to build 19 different vehicles, from luxury Audi A3s to small SUVs and budget models, a biological chassis would be a minimal microbial platform onto which could be bolted genetic instructions to make drugs, biofuels, cosmetics, or whatever one desires.
With the publication of the Science paper, two challenges become evident.
The first is that biology is complicated.
As Venter’s work shows, we do not yet have a sufficient grasp of the essentials of basic biology to design and build a cell.
Genes do not function like fenders or brakes; they cannot be mounted on a chassis to perform a function independently of other components.
Genes interact – amplifying, dampening, or even silencing one another.
And those effects, in turn, influence still other genes.
Genomes, it turns out, function less like machines than like ecosystems with multitudinous relationships and complex feedback loops.
Adding genomic parts to a synthetic organism in order to achieve a predictable result may be far more difficult than proponents of the chassis model have assumed.
The second challenge regards the competition.
When Venter and his team began their effort, genetic engineers had tools that were powerful but, by modern standards, crude.
In recent years, scientists have found ways to edit genes with far greater precision.
The most prominent, known as CRISPR Cas9, cuts DNA with remarkable (though not perfect) accuracy.
As a result, gene editing has emerged as an alternative strategy to the chassis model for tailoring microbes to make useful products.
It is impossible to know whether synthetic organisms like Venter’s JCVI-syn 3.0 or gene-editing techniques will prove to be commercially dominant in biotechnology – or indeed whether some other method will supplant both.
We can be confident, however, that our knowledge of basic biology will deepen, and that our growing ability to manipulate living organisms will confront us with increasingly serious ethical considerations.

Where Are the Green Sovereign Funds?
PARIS/MUNICH – Institutional investors are increasingly embracing the effort to achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.
Some are already implementing portfolio measures and incorporating climate factors into their decision-making.
The United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (which one of us chairs) has already welcomed 46 members, comprising pension funds and insurance companies representing some $6.7 trillion in assets under management (AUM).
The steps taken this decade will be decisive as regards hitting the mid-century target.
Of the Alliance’s members, 23 have publicly issued GHG-reduction targets for 2025, which means they are committed to acting immediately.
The remaining five members that are required to set targets this year will declare similar interim goals soon.
Net-zero initiatives are also being established in the investment-management and banking industries, representing $43 trillion and $37 trillion in AUM, respectively.
And yet, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) – representing AUM totaling around $10 trillion – are conspicuously absent, even though some are owned by governments that have adopted ambitious climate objectives.
Under existing international agreements, GHG emissions are measured at the country level, which understates the potential climate impact of countries with large foreign-asset holdings.
For example, the Norwegian SWF’s total asset holdings are three times the size of Norway’s economy, and its equity-portfolio carbon emissions are around twice the country’s own total emissions.
Norway is not alone.
A recent report by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) shows that SWFs around the world are lagging behind.
About three-quarters report having less than 10% of their holdings in climate-related strategies, while only 14% have made divestment decisions related to climate or environmental targets.
While 24% of SWFs consider climate action part of a broader ESG (environmental, social, and governance) framework, only 12% have an explicit climate-change policy.
To be sure, IFSWF’s own Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (the “Santiago Principles”) do not specify sustainability requirements for SWFs.
But governments of countries that have SWFs should view the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) in November as an opportunity to commit fully to the net-zero program.
There are several reasons why they should do this.
For starters, 2050 net-zero targets are becoming a mainstream expectation for all large institutional investors.
If a government chooses not to commit its SWF to this goal, it will be free riding on the growing share of the private financial sector that is already going green – a paradox of climate finance if there ever was one.
Moreover, it makes little sense for governments seeking to be consistent in their climate commitments to separate SWF portfolio emissions from overall climate objectives.
The domestic focus of international climate agreements should not be interpreted as a free pass for emissions associated with foreign investments.
Instead, governments should be using their SWFs’ financial weight to drive climate action internationally.
Last but not least, the transition to a low-carbon economy represents the biggest investment opportunity in decades.
Shifting from “brown” to “green” will require changes on the scale of another industrial revolution; those who create new markets or enter them early stand to reap massive returns.
As one of the few SWFs with an explicit emissions-reduction objective, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund has already begun to seize these new opportunities.
Between 2017 and 2020, the fund’s low-carbon benchmark portfolio, which comprises 40% of its total assets, generated returns that were 0.6% higher than its standard benchmark portfolio.
By contrast, Norway’s SWF missed out on $126 billion in potential returns during the same period, because it invested in oil and gas instead of green stocks.
Because many countries with SWFs have historically been heavily dependent on their oil and gas sector, the transition away from fossil fuels exposes them to larger economic risks.
But governments can mitigate these risks by aligning their SWFs with climate targets.
A total portfolio approach would enable these governments to start delinking domestic economic growth from SWF returns, thereby enhancing the robustness of the economy as a whole.
For SWFs, as for other institutional investors, staying on the sidelines of the global climate-mitigation effort is no longer an option.
But nor is it enough to focus solely on climate-related portfolio risk while ignoring a fund’s broader climate impact.
Were SWFs to get serious and join the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, they would be required to set stronger emissions targets every five years, reporting annually (alongside the usual financial disclosures) on their progress toward meeting them.
They would also be expected not only to invest in green assets but also – and more importantly – to develop new sustainable assets themselves.
Countries like France, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are well placed to lead a global SWF movement toward net-zero commitments at COP26.
If they do, other funds with large investment teams and sophisticated operations may soon follow, and those with fewer resources would, one hopes, be close behind them.
Most SWFs were established as savings vehicles for future generations.
It stands to reason that these funds should contribute to the conservation of the climate on which those generations will depend.

Argentina’s Warning to Would-Be Euro Deserters
BUENOS AIRES – The tensions between the eurozone’s north and south, and the complex and politically costly transfers of money required to dampen the euro crisis, have led many people to think the unthinkable: saving Europe’s common currency may require that some countries abandon it. Indeed, talk about exiting the euro has intensified, particularly in southern eurozone countries that desperately need to regain competitiveness.
Adopting a stronger currency (as in “euroization”) is neither difficult nor particularly unusual.
Introducing a new, weaker national currency to substitute for a stronger one in times of financial distress is an altogether different matter, about which most economists know almost nothing.
The closest experiment along these lines is probably Argentina’s exit in 2002 from its dollar exchange-rate peg (embodied in its currency board) to a floating regime that depreciated the peso by 300% in the first three months.
Despite Argentina’s obvious differences from the eurozone’s troubled southern economies, the Argentine currency rollercoaster provides sobering lessons for European policymakers to ponder.
Do Europeans want to return to their own version of a flexible “peso”?
At the very least, European policymakers will need to be willing to (a) “pesify” contracts, (b) impose heavy restrictions on commercial banking operations, (c) restructure debts, and (d) introduce capital and exchange controls.
Consider each facet more closely. First, a new currency needs to create its own demand as a means in which to conduct commercial transactions by displacing the euro as sole legal tender and unit of account.
This, in turn, requires the forced redenomination of prices, wages, and financial contracts, which can create serious disruptions, owing to heavy and asymmetrical balance-sheet effects, as well as a massive redistributive impact.
Argentina´s “pesification” of bank deposits and loans benefited debtors at the expense of depositors, inciting public upheaval.
Second, should any eurozone country quit the euro, the anticipation of forced pesification is likely to set off a bank panic, as depositors quickly switch their pesified holdings back into foreign exchange in order to move them out of the system and probably abroad.
In fact, in Argentina, people started to withdraw their deposits almost a year before the exit from the currency board, fueling capital flight and feeding back into market pressures to abandon the peg to the dollar – a dynamic that could be even faster and more furious in financially integrated European economies.
In these circumstances, a selective deposit freeze appears to be the only option to avoid bankrupting the banking sector.
Here, Argentina offers both a good and a bad example.
When all deposit withdrawals were capped in November 2001, the resulting liquidity crunch deepened the recession and, eventually, brought down the government.
By contrast, the restructuring of term deposits in January 2002 attenuated the bank run and kept the payments system alive, while allowing so-called “sight deposits” – which can be withdrawn immediately without penalty – to help build demand for pesos.
Third, while pesification removes balance sheet losses from domestic foreign-currency debts, external contractual obligations cannot be redenominated unilaterally.
Thus, the exit from the dollar peg requires a restructuring of external debt, both sovereign and corporate.
Indeed, Argentina’s sovereign default happened almost simultaneously with the demise of the currency board, but corporate renegotiations were a protracted affair.
Eventually, most companies avoided bankruptcy, mainly owing to the fourth ingredient in Argentina´s exit toolkit: capital controls that provided the legal umbrella to stop external corporate debt servicing.
Of course, controls are an inevitable ingredient in the exit mix.
Adopting a weaker currency is predicated on the need to regain competitiveness and improve external accounts.
But, in the short run, given the huge uncertainties involved in a regime switch, and the loss of access to capital markets that follows a debt renegotiation, foreign exchange becomes scarce, requiring a plethora of traditional restrictions – some more distorting than others – on capital movements.
In Europe, too, capital controls would be the only way to avoid the offshoring of financial settlements after the currency conversion and the freezing of bank deposits.
At any rate, experience indicates that exiting the euro while preserving the freedom of capital movements is little more than a fantasy.
Some observers suggest, based on Argentina’s precedent, that countries should introduce their own weaker currency to denominate wages and selected prices without leaving the euro.
We believe this analogy is misconstrued.
While Argentina did issue quasi-money in 2001 before abandoning the currency board, this money was conceived to meet fiscal needs and remained stable vis-à-vis the dollar.
Indeed, it is hard to imagine how this dual-currency scheme could have avoided the consequences of converting to a weaker currency if the quasi-money had depreciated, as the idea’s current promoters intend.
Argentina’s exit from its dollar peg was a traumatic experience, concentrating contract violations, wealth redistribution, defaults, bank runs, exchange restrictions, and severe limitations on capital movements into a short period of time.
Even so, it was simpler than introducing a “new drachma” would be for, say, Greece.
Because Argentina’s currency board never eliminated the peso as the main means of transactions, the basis for demand for it was there at the time of the blowup.
Euro defectors, by contrast, would need to promote demand for the new currency from scratch – a much messier and nastier process altogether.

Fighting the Diseases of Want and Plenty
BERLIN – “Diseases of want” arise from poverty, while “diseases of plenty” are associated with affluence.
Many of the illnesses in each category are avoidable, but stopping them will require a revolutionary change in our approach to medicine.
Diseases of want are avoidable because poverty is avoidable.
We have the technical expertise to eliminate extreme poverty simply by sharing information, generating relevant skills, and redistributing a small fraction of economic resources.
Our failure to overcome diseases of want thus reflects not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.
And it is this unwillingness, not the diseases themselves, that we must address.
By contrast, diseases of plenty – such as obesity, tobacco-related illnesses, depression, diabetes, and various types of cancer – arise because our affluent lifestyles make us ill.
Such illnesses also are avoidable, but again, we lack the will to conquer them.
They occur because our approach to medicine is fundamentally wrong.
Once we have understood this, we will be better able to tackle diseases of want as well.
The problem is that modern medicine focuses primarily on treatment rather than prevention.
It is supposedly people’s right to live as they choose, and if they fall seriously ill, their health system – doctors, hospital managers, insurers, medical researchers, and many non-medical support staff – is meant to cure them.
If we took an equivalent approach to aviation safety, we would allow anyone to fly airplanes, with or without a license, and would not monitor safety equipment.
If a plane crashed, aviation safety personnel would make every effort to save the injured, which would be expensive, given the gravity of the injuries.
Yet, in practice, aviation safety efforts concentrate almost entirely on preventing accidents in the first place.
Aircraft are required to be serviced regularly.
Weather information is readily available.
Pilots and other aviation personnel receive rigorous formal safety training, and strictly enforced rules ensure that a pilot’s performance is not impeded by fatigue or alcohol.
The industry has many other safeguards, most of which are implemented automatically.
Furthermore, all major aviation accidents are investigated by a national body whose reports are made public.
Pilots are usually granted immunity from prosecution.
And the aviation industry regards the safety of each passenger as equally important, regardless of what they paid for their respective tickets.
Variations in ticket prices reflect differences in comfort and amenities, not in safety.
Now, suppose that we applied this aviation safety approach to medicine.
Everyone would get regular, mandatory health checks, and have guaranteed access to information about healthy living.
In addition, everyone would receive rigorous training in how to maintain their health, whether in school or at work.
Rules for protecting one’s health would be strictly enforced, with automatic health safety checks at home, at work, and elsewhere.
At the same time, a national body would investigate all major diseases and publish its reports.
Doctors, like pilots, would be immune from prosecution.
Finally, the system would give equal attention to each person’s basic health, regardless of how much they paid for their health care.
Different levels of individual spending on health would reflect differences in comfort and amenities, not in treatment.
In order to acquire a health-oriented mindset in medicine, rather than the ubiquitous view that medicine is meant to cure illness, it is useful to be guided by Detlev Ganten’s “health formula”: your health depends on your body’s biology, your environment, and your behavior.
Like most profound insights, Ganten’s formula sounds obvious once expressed.
Crucially, it understands health as a state that is achieved when our behavior within our environment is adapted to our bodily needs.
Thus, any behavior that makes our bodies maladaptive to our environment is unhealthy.
And so is any environment, created through our lifestyles, that makes our behavior maladaptive to our bodies.
Once we take this health formula to heart, we see medicine with new eyes.
For example, diabetes, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, arthritis, gout, heartburn, and gallstones, as well as cancer of the breast, intestine, and prostate, commonly arise from obesity and stress.
Obesity often is a consequence of sedentary work and recreation habits, which result from the way we build our offices, schools, and cities.
Thus, an important part of tackling diseases of plenty is for people to change their daily routines – such as by taking frequent brisk walks, playing sports regularly, sitting on appropriately designed chairs, and avoiding sugary foods.
Stress, meanwhile, frequently is caused by insecurity and disempowerment at work, unemployment, homelessness, or deficient social ties.
Tackling this problem thus has implications for both government policy and companies’ strategy.
For example, giving workers control over their daily work schedules, promoting cooperative work cultures, and mindfulness training at work could all reduce stress and contribute to public health.
Medications, doctors, and operating rooms still would play a role in such a health system, of course, but only after all the safety checks had been observed – just as ambulances have a function after a plane crash.
Instead, we should focus mainly on how we conduct our lives, the example we set for family and friends, what we teach our children, and the physical and social contexts we create for our work and leisure activities.
And although there also is a strong case for universal health care and an important role for government, this role lies primarily in prevention.
The same preventive approach would help the world’s poorest countries overcome diseases of want.
Assistance to these countries should focus on eliminating extreme poverty and creating the social settings, habits, expectations, values, norms, and laws that promote health.
This is a new vision of medicine for rich and poor countries alike, where health systems still overwhelmingly concentrate on treating illnesses.
By focusing instead on prevention, while adapting our environments and behaviors to our bodily needs, we can initiate a new age of medicine that enables us to overcome a host of avoidable diseases.

Europe and the New World Order
BERLIN – November 15, 2008, is a date to remember, because on that day history was made.
For the first time, the G-20, the world’s 20 leading economies, came together in Washington, D.C., to find an answer to the global financial and economic crisis.
While this first meeting resulted in nothing more than declarations of intent, it still marks a historic turning point.
Faced with the gravest financial and economic crisis worldwide since the 1930’s, the Western industrial nations (including Russia) that previously dominated the world economy are no longer capable of coming up with an effective response.
Moreover, hopes for mitigating or, indeed, overcoming the global economic crisis rest exclusively with the emerging economic powers, first and foremost China.
As a result, the G-8, which excludes the most important emerging-market countries, has lost its significance for good.
Globalization has resulted in a lasting change in the distribution of power and opportunities, laying the groundwork for a new world order for the twenty-first century.
Once the current global crisis is over, nothing will ever be the same again.
The West – the United States and Europe – are in relative decline, while the emerging Asian and Latin American powers will be among the winners.
The US has responded to the decline of its global strength in an impressive manner, with the election of its first African-American president, Barack Obama.
Amidst one of the gravest crises in its history, America has proven to itself and the world its ability to reinvent itself.
And it is clear even now that this decision will have three long-term consequences.
First, the election of a black president will put to rest the tragic legacy of slavery and the American Civil War.
From now on, the issues of skin color, eye shape, or gender will no longer play a deciding role for a candidate for high, or even the highest, office.
The US political system now reflects the country’s demographic changes, as non-white sections of the population grow the fastest.
Second, Obama’s election will lead to a reorientation of US foreign policy in the medium term.
In particular, the transatlantic/European focus of American foreign policy, which was previously a matter of course, will increasingly become a thing of the past.
Third, the internal realignment of America’s political-cultural perspective will be reinforced by the ongoing global shift of wealth and power from the West to the East.
The Northeastern Pacific powers – China, Japan, and South Korea – are already America’s most significant creditors by far, and their importance will increase further as a result of the financial crisis.
For the foreseeable future, the greatest opportunities for growth lie in this region, and for both economic and geopolitical reasons America will increasingly turn toward the Pacific region, thus downgrading its transatlantic orientation.
All of this is bad news for Europe, because once this global crisis is over, Europeans will simply have become less important.
And, unfortunately, Europe is not only doing nothing to hold off or reverse its decline – it is accelerating the process through its own behavior.
With the election of Obama, America has turned toward the future within a globalized, multipolar world; Europe, on the other hand, is rediscovering national action in this time of crisis, and thus banking on the past!
The European constitution has failed, the Lisbon reform treaty is in limbo after the Irish rejected it, and stronger European economic governance is blocked by German-French disunity.
The reaction of EU member states to this ongoing self-inflicted impasse is unambiguous: rather than trying to reenergize the process of further political and economic integration, they are primarily acting on their own to try to fill the vacuum that has emerged.
Certainly, coordination between the member states exists, and is even successful at times, but without strong European institutions, such singular successes will not last.
There is a very real danger that Europe will simply miss out on an historic strategic turn towards a multipolar world – and at a high price.
After the summit in Washington, it should have sunk in among Europeans everywhere – even the Euroskeptics of the British Isles – that this strategic realignment is taking place right now!
If Europeans cannot get their heads around the fact that the nineteenth century is over, the global caravan will continue to move forward into the twenty-first century without them.

Systems at Risk
GENEVA – Failure to adapt to climate change, persistent extreme weather, and major systemic financial failure are just three of 50 major risks monitored every year in the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report.
It seems natural to draw connections among them, especially after a “superstorm” shut down Wall Street this past October.
Indeed, the report reminds us of the many ways in which systems inevitably affect one another in our interdependent world.
More important, the report warns of the dangers of multiple systems failing.
Two of the world’s most fundamental systems, for example, are the economy and the environment; their interplay underpins the first of three case studies of risk in this year’s report.
The 1,000 experts who responded to the WEF’s annual Global Risks Perception Survey, on which the report is based, ranked climate-change adaptation as their top environmental concern in the coming decade.
This reflects a wider shift in thinking about the climate, with growing acceptance that we are now locked in to some degree of global temperature change and need to adapt locally – for example, by strengthening our critical infrastructure systems in order to boost their resilience to extreme weather events.
But we face these environmental challenges at a time of persistent economic weakness.
Global growth remains slow; and, with monetary and fiscal policies having a limited impact on economic recovery, governments have neither the resources nor the courage to push for major projects.
Not surprisingly, our survey group ranked chronic fiscal imbalances second among 50 global risks that are most likely to manifest themselves over the next ten years.
Strong economies provide the leeway to invest in climate adaptation, while environmental stability ensures the breathing space needed to attend to economic problems.
Facing stresses on both systems simultaneously is like losing both engines on an airplane in mid-flight.
The second case study takes another perspective on systems thinking.
What happens if an apparently “minor” system – such as social media – sparks a “major” geopolitical crisis?
With the growing reach of social networks, information can spread worldwide almost instantaneously.
The benefits of this are well documented, but the risks of misinformation are not.
Consider the real-world case of someone shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.
Could something similar happen digitally, with a spark of misinformation igniting a conflagration and wreaking havoc before the truth is revealed?
The report’s third case study looks at what happens when we become complacent about a vital system.
For example, constant innovation in medical science over the last 100 years has left us with the impression that our health-care systems can never regress.
But experts are increasingly concerned about the potential for pandemics caused by bacteria resistant to all current antibiotics, while our intellectual-property system is failing to create adequate incentives for the development of new varieties.
The director-general of the World Health Organization has warned that if the world falls back into a pre-antibiotic age, a scratch or throat infection could become lethal once again.
Each case highlights the need to consider how to make systems more resilient, which means that systems cannot be considered in isolation.
They are both plugged into larger systems and comprised of smaller subsystems.
While, ideally, global risks would be met with global responses, the reality is that these risks manifest themselves mainly at the national level, and countries must address them largely on their own.
So we need to assess national resilience by regularly evaluating critical subsystems within countries.
The WEF currently is developing metrics that could evaluate national subsystems across five factors of resilience – redundancy, robustness, resourcefulness, response, and recovery – by combining perception-based data with publicly available statistical data.
Initial perception-based data gathered by the Forum is pointing toward the importance of leadership ability, transparency, efficiency, and good relationships between public and private-sector stakeholders.
While the development of these metrics is in its early stages, the ultimate aim is to develop a practical diagnostic tool that would function as an “MRI” for national decision-makers to assess their countries’ resilience to global risks.
By revealing underlying weaknesses that more traditional risk-assessment methods may miss, we could pinpoint the structural reforms, behavioral changes, and strategic investments that increased resilience requires.
The result would not only directly benefit each country willing to engage in this process. It would also imply accelerated innovation in global governance, which we need more than ever for the sake of preserving the integrity of our most crucial systems.

Trump’s Failed Iran Policy
CANBERRA – In response to US President Donald Trump’s policy of maximum pressure, Iran has just seized a second foreign oil tanker.
Trump’s approach to bringing Iran’s Islamic regime to heel clearly is not working.
If anything, it has created another Middle East flashpoint, undermined transatlantic relations, benefited Russia and China, and struck a serious blow to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Where to from here?
Trump’s biggest problem is that the other signatories to the 2015 nuclear agreement – officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – from which he has withdrawn the United States, have remained committed to the deal.
Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China have also opposed Trump’s imposition of crippling economic sanctions on Iran.
They are committed to preserving the agreement and to doing everything possible to persuade Iran’s leaders to continue to adhere to it.
The European signatories have established a special mechanism to facilitate trade and business with Iran at the risk of US retaliation, while Russia and China have expanded their economic and strategic ties with the Islamic Republic, marking the first time in the history of the Western alliance that America’s European allies have joined forces with its rivals.
These powers’ support for Iran is not adequate to compensate for American secondary sanctions, which punish all governments and companies that do business there.
But it can soften the sanctions’ effects and strengthen the Iranian regime’s resilience.
Iran has already shown its capacity to resist by downing an US spy drone, allegedly targeting six oil tankers, and seizing two more in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz.
It has thus signaled its ability to choke the Strait, through which one-fifth of the world’s oil passes, despite the US show of force in the Gulf to ensure maritime safety.
Trump’s usual confusing policy pronouncements have not helped him either.
He has moved from one end of the spectrum, defined by his hawkish Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to act militarily against Iran, to the other end, where his own “no war” impulses have prevailed.
He seeks to use America’s economic power, combined with threats, rather than military might, to achieve his objectives.
But when it comes to Iran, he has picked the wrong target.
He and his advisers have shown a very poor understanding of the nature of the Iranian regime and have underestimated its reactive capability in a highly complex region.
Trump’s team has missed the point that the regime is well entrenched and benefits from a robust regional security structure, stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon and Yemen.
It is ideological in character, but pragmatic when it comes to its survival.
The fortunes of the ruling clerics and their supporters are intertwined with the regime’s survival.
The highest echelons of the regime still comprise those who are very distrustful of the US, owing to America’s long years of support for the monarchy of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 revolution that toppled the Shah, sought to build an Islamic polity with the capacity to withstand its internal and external adversaries.
Khomeini died in mid-1989, but his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has essentially followed in his footsteps, acting both ideologically and pragmatically in order to ensure the continuity of the Islamic regime.
While resentful of the US and its allies, he has been flexible enough, for example, to bless the JCPOA, forge close relations with Russia and China, and maintain reasonable ties with European powers to cope with American pressure.
Meanwhile, the Islamic regime has worked intensively to build its soft and hard power, involving a network of sectarian and strategic partners across the region.
It has nurtured an asymmetrical warfare strategy in order not only to survive a foreign attack, but to turn it into a devastating regional confrontation.
It has lived with US sanctions for most of its 40 years and mastered a variety of methods to circumvent American pressure.
This does not mean that the regime is unwilling to renegotiate the JCPOA.
It has already signaled a willingness to do so, but only if this does not threaten its domestic and regional security and only if given sufficient economic and strategic incentives to do so.
The regime remains factionalized between hardliners and moderates, with the former in control of more levers of power than the latter.
But it would be erroneous to assume that in the face of a serious external threat all the factions would not unite, and be supported by a majority of the public, who have historically been known for their fierce nationalist sentiment.
The US policy of confronting and containing the regime has not borne fruit.
President Barack Obama’s policy of engagement proved to be more productive, as the conclusion of the JCPOA showed.
Trump, however, has painted himself into a corner, and now faces the prospect of an unwinnable military confrontation with far-reaching regional and wider implications, including economically devastating effects on oil supplies and prices.

Trump’s North Korean Appeasement
DENVER – Having met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un three times – all to great fanfare – US President Donald Trump may still believe that denuclearization is underway in the Hermit Kingdom.
If so, he is the probably the only one who does, given North Korea’s frequent missile tests and upgrades to its weapons.
It is anyone’s guess what the Trump administration’s North Korea policy will look like in a year, but for now, both sides seem to have what they want.
Trump has wrangled a loose stalemate that could hold through the November 2020 US presidential election, and Kim has secured a suspension of US-South Korean military exercises, in exchange for freezing his nuclear tests.
The summits with Kim never should have led to the current “freeze for freeze” arrangement, which weakens the US-South Korea alliance.
Yet when first meeting Kim in Singapore in June 2018, Trump decided simply to follow his instincts.
He has been taking US policy on North Korea in the wrong direction ever since.
Thinking like a New York real-estate developer, Trump assumed that North Korea wanted economic relief.
But he also listened carefully to Kim’s explanation of why North Korea pursued nuclear weapons in the first place: to deter a supposedly hostile United States from attacking it.
If Trump found this argument plausible, that may be because his own national security adviser, John Bolton, is a living, breathing validation of North Korean fears.
Given Bolton’s blood-curdling scenarios, Trump could hardly blame Kim for being worried.
And so, at the press conference following the Singapore summit, Trump openly considered curtailing “expensive” US-South Korean military exercises, which he described using Kim’s own terminology (“wargames”).
Between freezing joint exercises and making his always eager secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, available for peace-treaty negotiations, Trump assumed that he had addressed North Korea’s chronic trust issues.
He need only maintain his avuncular relationship with Kim, and he would be a shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize.
It has now been 15 months, and the North Korean regime is still not even remotely interested in considering denuclearization.
Trump’s team – if one can call it that – is in disarray, cognizant of the imminent policy failure, but reluctant to admit that their dear leader may be in over his head.
Steve Biegun, the US Special Representative for North Korea, continues to consult with relevant third parties, maintaining the fiction that denuclearization is still on the table.
But he does not appear to be receiving any support from Bolton or Trump, the latter having convinced himself that progress depends on his personal intervention.
The North Koreans would agree with Trump on that, albeit not for the same reasons.
Unlike Biegun, Pompeo, or Bolton – all of whom speak of denuclearization with a sense of urgency – Trump seems to agree with the North Koreans that there is plenty of time.
After all, he is primarily concerned with protecting his signature diplomatic achievement until November 2020.
Accordingly, he need only maintain the appearance of progress through periodic feel-good summits.
Moreover, the Trump administration and the Kim regime share a disinterest in developing a broader diplomatic architecture.
North Korea has always preferred a bilateral process with the US, because that format enhances its own prestige, and, unlike the moribund six-party talks, avoids the appearance that it is being ganged up on.
To be sure, dealing directly with Trump can be risky (he did, after all, walk out of the Hanoi summit in February).
But, overall, the process of summits and love letters has created a warm relationship between Kim and Trump, thereby softening the latter’s position.
The US, meanwhile, has been happy to brief interested third countries on the process, while keeping them on the sidelines and out of the negotiating room.
Other members of the six-party process – South Korea, Japan, Russia, and China – have seen little reason to believe that progress is at hand.
But they might as well let the US shoulder the burden and reputational risks of managing North Korea on its own.
There is never any guarantee that the North Koreans will play the role set for them.
As matters stand, the benefits of the current stalemate probably exceed the costs of the sanctions regime, which has grown increasingly leaky.
But the intensity of the North Koreans’ response to any mention of US-South Korean exercises suggests that they may see an opportunity in the current standoff – and in this president – to undermine US regional engagement more broadly.
The Kim regime’s recent missile tests and behavior toward South Korea may be meant as a warning to Trump.
If so, the message is clear: unless you placate us, we will cause problems for you before November 2020.
Trump might like the world to think that he is maintaining strategic patience with respect to North Korea.
But it is now clear that his administration’s policy is one of appeasement.
Whether it will work for him remains to be seen.
November 2020 is still a long way off.

The Promise of China’s Pearl River Delta
HONG KONG – July 1, 2017, will mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China, after more than a century of British colonial rule.
It comes at a moment when China’s leaders are increasingly promoting Hong Kong’s unique role in advancing the country’s economic development.
Two months ago, Premier Li Keqiang described China’s intention to deepen economic cooperation across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area – which Hong Kong analysts have called the Pearl River Delta (PRD) – in order to reinforce its role as a major driver of sustainable development.
The region includes Guangdong’s nine key cities – including Guangzhou, Foshan, and Shenzhen – plus Hong Kong and Macau.
Last year, the PRD’s population stood at 68 million, and its GDP was $1.3 trillion.
The PRD is the southern pillar of the three Chinese coastal growth clusters.
In the middle is the Yangzi River Delta (YRD), which includes Shanghai, has a population of 130 million and GDP of $2 trillion.
To the north is the Beijing/Tianjin/Bohai (BTB) corridor, covering ten key cities; it has a population of 100 million and GDP of $1.3 trillion.
Taken together, these three clusters account for 21% of China’s population and just under 40% of its GDP.
The PRD has the lowest population of the three, but the highest income per capita, and it forms an important link between China and global supply chains.
It gains a distinct advantage from the free-trade, low-tax, and highly globalized cities of Hong Kong and Macau; both are “special administrative regions” under China’s “one country, two systems” principle.
Another major asset is Shenzhen, a highly innovative “special economic zone” boasting a dynamic capital market and a tradition of experimentation with private-sector-driven job creation and integration into global supply chains.
The PRD’s competitiveness is no accident.
Deng Xiaoping used the region as a kind of public-policy laboratory, allowing different legal and institutional arrangements to exist concurrently, while China figured out how to approach globalization.
The system clearly works, but it does suffer from a fundamental contradiction, related to the economist Ronald Coase’s concept of transaction costs.
Thanks to China’s geographic, demographic, and economic scale, “reform and opening up,” in Deng’s phrase, and technological progress naturally drive down transaction costs, improving markets’ capacity to allocate resources.
This process often fuels specialization, with regional or municipal economies focusing on their own competitive advantages, in order to maximize their gains from the decline in transaction costs.
Such specialization can be seen clearly in the PRD.
Hong Kong is becoming a hub of international finance and services, while Macau establishes itself as a global gambling and entertainment center.
Meanwhile, Shenzhen is focusing on technological innovation; Guangzhou is a global trading hub; and Foshan and Dongguan are major manufacturing bases.
While each city appears to be imbalanced in its economic structure, the city cluster as a whole is well balanced and highly competitive.
But – and herein lies the contradiction – massive numbers of transactions can raise financial, social, and security risks, which can fuel systemic volatility and contagion across regions and sectors.
To mitigate these risks, governments and regulators must intervene, potentially even imposing restrictions on markets that artificially raise transaction costs.
China’s leaders would do well to remember this as they attempt to take advantage of the strengths of various systems to build a more open, modern, and faster-growing economy.
Chinese policymakers certainly recognize the value of city clusters to advance economic development and ease the pressures of rapid urbanization.
The urban share of the Chinese population surpassed 50% in 2011, and another 300 million people could be living in urban areas within the next 20 years.
In this context, city clusters could be essential to innovation and job creation, particularly in the service sector, while limiting resource wastage, avoiding further environmental degradation, and easing urban congestion from overcrowding.
Already, China has worked with Singapore and other major cities to improve urban design, water management, and environmental sustainability, as well as taking steps to tap the potential of the sharing economy.
Moreover, in April, President Xi Jinping announced the formation of the Xiongan New Area, about 50 miles south of Beijing, which will serve as a venue for experimentation with policies that enable innovative start-ups to replace obsolete smokestack industries.
The goal is to encourage job creation in sustainable industries while relieving urban congestion in the capital.
As for Hong Kong, China’s leaders view it as a source of valuable economic-development “software” – including an independent judiciary, a robust anti-corruption regime, a stable currency, and world-class capital markets.
Hong Kong’s high-quality and internationally oriented education system, and its efficient and sophisticated city-management scheme, are also important assets.
Hong Kong’s “software” complements China’s broader drive to build the “hardware” of development, exemplified in the One Belt, One Road initiative, which entails massive investment in infrastructure linking China to the rest of the world.
Already, stock-connect schemes involving Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and London are being established to support Chinese city clusters’ ability to meet OBOR-driven demand for offshore financing.
But more must be done to help Hong Kong – and, more broadly, the PRD – meet its potential.
Hong Kong’s world-class services sector currently is working below capacity, owing to physical constraints.
With better cross-border transport infrastructure and more flexible schemes for delivering medical, financial, and social services, senior citizens could retire outside of Hong Kong’s city limits, creating space for younger workers.
While many observers focus on China’s credit glut, the authorities are quietly fostering the development of dynamic city clusters.
But, in order to protect and sustain this progress, Chinese policymakers must work to minimize the risks associated with rapid urbanization and growing specialization. Otherwise, trends that are doing China so much good may end up undermining prosperity and social stability.

Democracy on a Knife-Edge
CAMBRIDGE – In Mohammed Hanif’s novel Red Birds, an American bomber pilot crashes his plane in the Arabian desert and is stranded among the locals in a nearby refugee camp.
He finds himself talking about thieves with a local shopkeeper.
“Our government is the biggest thief,” he explains.
“It steals from the living, it steals from the dead.”
The shopkeeper replies, “Thank God we don’t have that problem.
We just steal from each other.”
This little vignette just about summarizes the key message of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson’s new book, The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty.
Acemoglu and Robinson’s thesis is that prospects for freedom and prosperity balance on a knife-edge between state oppression and the lawlessness and violence that society so often inflicts on itself.
Give the state too much of an upper hand over society, and you have despotism.
Render the state weak vis-à-vis society, and you get anarchy.
As the book’s title signals, there is only a “narrow corridor” between these two dystopias, a slender path that only a few countries, mostly in the industrialized West, have managed to find.
Furthermore, getting on the path does not guarantee staying on it.
Acemoglu and Robinson emphasize that unless civil society remains vigilant and is able to mobilize against would-be autocrats, authoritarian regress always remains a possibility.
Acemoglu and Robinson’s new book builds on their previous blockbuster, Why Nations Fail.
In that book and other writings, they identified what they call “inclusive institutions” as the principal driver of economic and political progress.
These institutions, such as secure property rights and the rule of law, are accessible to all (or most) citizens and do not favor a narrow group of elites over the rest of society.
One country that has always given the Acemoglu-Robinson thesis some trouble is China.
The Communist Party of China’s monopoly of political power, the country’s rampant corruption, and the ease with which the Party’s economic competitors and political opponents can be dispossessed hardly smack of inclusive institutions.
Yet it is undeniable that over the last four decades the Chinese regime has achieved unprecedented rates of economic growth and the most impressive reduction in poverty in recorded history.
In Why Nations Fail, Acemoglu and Robinson argued that Chinese economic growth will run out of steam unless extractive political institutions give way to inclusive institutions.
They double down on this thesis in The Narrow Corridor.
They characterize China as a country where a strong state has dominated society for almost two and a half millennia.
Having spent so much time outside the corridor, they argue, it is unlikely that China can make a smooth entry back in.
Neither political reform nor continued rapid economic growth seems likely.
The other large country that now seems to sit ill at ease with the original Acemoglu-Robinson thesis is the United States.
At the time Why Nations Fail was written, many still considered the US a prime example of inclusive institutions – a country that got rich and became democratic through the development of secure property rights and the rule of law.
Today, the income distribution of the US is as skewed as in any plutocracy.
And the country’s representative political institutions, under attack from a demagogue, look decidedly brittle.
The Narrow Corridor seems to be written in part to provide an account of the apparent fragility of liberal democracies.
The authors coin the term “Red Queen Effect” to denote the ever-continuing struggle to uphold open political institutions.
Like the character in the Lewis Carroll book, civil society has to run ever faster to keep up with authoritarian leaders and restrain their despotic tendencies.
The ability of civil society to stand up to “Leviathan” may in turn depend on social divisions and their evolution.
Democracy typically emerges from the rise of popular groups that can challenge the power of the elites or from splits among elites.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, industrialization, world wars, and de-colonization led to the mobilization of such groups.
Ruling elites acceded to their opponents’ demands that the franchise be extended, without property qualifications, (usually) to all males.
In return, the newly enfranchised groups accepted limits on their ability to expropriate property holders.
In short, voting rights were exchanged for property rights.
But, as I discuss in joint work with Sharun Mukand, liberal democracy requires more: rights that protect minorities (what we may call civil rights).
The defining characteristic of the political settlement that generates democracy is that it excludes the main beneficiary of civil rights – minorities – from the bargaining table.
These minorities have neither resources (like the elite) nor numbers (like the majority) behind them.
The political settlement thus favors an impoverished kind of democracy – what one might call electoral democracy – over liberal democracy.
This helps explain why liberal democracy is such a rare beast.
The failure to protect minority rights is a readily understood consequence of the political logic behind the emergence of democracy.
What requires explanation is not the relative rarity of liberal democracy, but its existence.
The surprise is not that few democracies are liberal, but that there are any liberal democracies at all.
This is hardly a comforting conclusion at a time when liberal democracy seems very much under threat, even in those parts of the world where it seems to have been permanently entrenched.
But by appreciating the fragility of liberal democracy, we can perhaps avoid the lassitude induced by taking it for granted.

Worker Protection in the Gig Economy
BERKELEY – Today’s labor markets are undergoing radical change, as digital platforms transform how they operate and revolutionize the nature of work.
In many ways, this is a positive development, one that has the potential to match workers with jobs more efficiently and transparently than ever before.
But the increasing digitization of the labor market also has at least one very worrying drawback: it is undermining the traditional employer-employee relationships that have been the primary channel through which worker benefits and protections have been provided.
The ecosystem of digital labor platforms is still in its infancy, but it is developing rapidly.
Large popular platforms like LinkedIn have so far mainly been used to match high-skill workers with high-end jobs.
But these platforms are already expanding to accommodate middle-skill workers and jobs.
Nearly 400 million people have posted their resumes on LinkedIn, and in 2014 the site facilitated more than one million new hires worldwide.
Meanwhile, other types of digital platforms are emerging, linking workers with customers or companies for specific tasks or services.
Such platforms play a growing role in the market for “contingent” or “on-demand” workers, broadly defined as workers whose jobs are temporary and who do not have standard part-time or full-time contracts with employers.
Well-known digital platforms that link contingent workers directly to customers include Lyft, TaskRabbit, Uber, and Angie’s List.
Freelancer.com and Upwork are examples of platforms that help companies find and hire contingent workers for a range of specialized tasks such as software or website development.
Freelancer.com has more than 17 million users worldwide.
The trouble is that even as these sites provide new opportunities for workers and companies, they are bypassing the traditional channels through which the US and many countries deliver benefits and protections to their workforce.
In the US, in particular, the “social contract” has long relied on employers to deliver unemployment insurance, disability insurance, pensions and retirement plans, worker’s compensation for job-related injuries, paid time off, and protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Although the Affordable Care Act has made it easier for workers to acquire health insurance on their own, most workers continue to receive health insurance through their employers.
With the proliferation of digital job platforms, the social safety net for workers in the US – threadbare to begin with – is at risk of unraveling for a growing share of the workforce.
This is because most individuals who find work through digital job platforms operate as independent contractors, leaving them without the benefits and protections provided in standard employment contracts for full-time and part-time workers.
The difference between the cost of a full-time employee with benefits and an independent contractor can be 30% or more, so there is a strong incentive for companies to replace workers on standard full-time employment contracts with independent contractors as long as companies can attract the talent they need.
Digital job platforms also make it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers on temporary contingent contracts.
This creates the potential for a race to the bottom, with employers competing on labor costs through regulatory arbitrage.
Unless policymakers act, the US will continue to drift toward a two-tier labor market.
One tier will be populated by fully employed high-skill workers with generous employer-provided (and tax-advantaged) benefits, as well as high-skill individuals who finance their own benefits from high incomes earned as independent contractors or from self-employment. The other tier will include a large pool of contingent middle- and low-skill workers without the benefits, income, or security on which a robust and resilient middle class depends.
New policies are needed to provide workers in contingent employment relationships access to benefits, and new institutions are needed to deliver them.
There is growing support for the view that benefits should satisfy at least three conditions. They should be portable, attached to individual workers rather than to their employers.
They should be universal, applying to all workers and all forms of employment. And they should be pro-rated, linking employer benefit contributions to time worked, jobs completed, or income earned.
Two recent proposals incorporating these conditions call for the creation of “individual security accounts” analogous to US Social Security accounts, but encompassing portable benefits that would be available to all workers, regardless of employment status, and would accrue via pro-rated automatic payroll contributions.
A group of strange bedfellows – “gig” employers, labor organizations, venture capitalists, and bipartisan think tanks – recently issued a letter calling for a stable and flexible safety net based on these conditions.
Meanwhile, in Congress, forward-looking policymakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia are seeking ways to get ahead of the issues and create momentum for bipartisan solutions.
Much remains to be done before a new safety net for all workers is in place: determining which benefits and protections to include, how to pay for them, and how to deliver them to workers.
Labor groups, including unions or new types of labor organizations like Coworker.org and the Freelancers Union, could fill the gap, providing benefits as unions have done in the construction industry and guilds have done in the entertainment industry.
In Silicon Valley, where thousands of contractors and freelancers are hired every week, new private companies like MBO Partners are emerging to handle the benefits of contingent workers who work for many employers.
The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that digital labor platforms could increase US GDP by 2.3% and US full-time equivalent employment by 2.7% by 2025.
But realizing these economy-wide gains while providing a secure and portable safety net for all workers will require new ways of thinking by companies and policymakers.

New Financial Conditions, Same Climate Calculus
NEW YORK – In its most recent assessment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offered a comprehensive outline of what it will take to keep global warming below 1.5° Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels, in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
The bottom line is simple: Greenhouse-gas emissions must peak by 2025.
To achieve that goal, financial flows must rapidly be redirected from fossil fuels toward renewable energy.
In its Net Zero by 2050 report last year, the International Energy Agency made clear that, “There is no need for investment in new fossil-fuel supply in our net-zero pathway.”
But fossil-fuel financing has continued.
JPMorgan Chase, a bank that uses IEA modeling and data for its own “net-zero” commitment, ended up supplying the fossil-fuel industry with $61.7 billion last year.
And this year, Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused fossil-fuel stocks to surge, even while equity markets overall approach bear territory.
Despite the rapid growth of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, it is well known that leading financial institutions remain major funders of the climate crisis, bankrolling coal plants, oil pipelines, gas infrastructure, and other emissions-generating projects around the world.
But now that the financial sector’s annual general meeting (AGM) season has started, shareholders have an opportunity to demand more robust climate policies and decarbonization strategies from financial institutions and institutional investors.
Because commercial banks’ ownership is structured through publicly traded shares, AGMs allow shareholders to leverage their relative influence over the institution’s investments and policy decisions.
They are also an opportunity for civil-society groups to call attention to an institution’s practices and demand change.
Climate-change activists have a strong business and financial case to make.
Between the war in Ukraine, soaring energy prices, and hopes to sustain a post-pandemic economic recovery, there are numerous incentives to accelerate investment in renewables.
Such investments would drive the post-pandemic recovery, create widespread job opportunities, and increase returns for investors.
Moreover, notwithstanding the recent energy-price spikes, fossil-fuel investments continue to pose an enormous risk to financial institutions.
As the energy transition progresses, fossil-fuel assets will lose their value and become stranded.
Since the start of the pandemic, many banks, pension funds, and global investment houses have started pulling away from fossil-fuel investments for precisely this reason.
It started with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s surprising annual letter to CEOs, in which he singled out climate change as a key risk-management issue.
A few days later, BlackRock announced that one of its fastest-growing sustainability funds will stop investing in tar sands, one of the dirtiest fuel sources on the planet.
We know that shareholder activism works.
Last year, co-filers from 350.org Japan, Kiko Network, Rainforest Action Network, and Market Forces proposed a climate resolution at the AGM of Japan’s largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which has some $3.1 trillion in assets and is the world’s third-largest lender to the coal industry.
The resolution sought to inform investors of the risks associated with the bank’s continued financing of fossil fuel, and it called on the bank to adopt a strategy aligned with the Paris climate agreement’s targets.
Over the following months, the bank released a carbon-neutrality declaration, an updated business plan, and a revised environmental and social policy framework.
Similarly, following engagement between shareholders and investors at HSBC’s 2021 AGM, the bank announced in March that it will phase down fossil-fuel financing on a schedule aligned with a 1.5oC target, as well as update its oil, gas, and coal policies by the end of 2022.
For good reason, the climate movement increasingly sees bank AGMs as an effective theater of intervention.
They provide a platform not only for shareholder resolutions but also for activists to send a clear message to the broader business community – as happened at the French bank BNP Paribas’s recent AGM in Paris.
Activists also have launched demonstrations at HSBC, Barclays, and Standard Chartered’s AGMs, prompting some financial institutions to try to avoid being called out for their fossil-fuel financing by moving their meetings online.
True, with fossil-fuel stocks up and ESG commitments potentially being sidelined by more immediate market concerns, the climate movement could be facing headwinds this year.
But other recent developments have generated forward momentum.
Climate scientists have issued increasingly stark warnings about what awaits us if we fail to decarbonize rapidly.
Viewed in the proper context, the slight uptick in fossil-fuel stocks is a mere blip against the backdrop of record-setting temperatures across Europe, deadly heatwaves in Pakistan and India, and drought concerns around the world.
Given these warnings and the accelerating effects of climate change, it is rational for investors to expect much tighter carbon regulations and public support for renewables in the near future.
These policies will have significant economic ramifications in many regions of the world.
They will be part of a bigger global transition that is already shifting our economies in the only sustainable direction: toward carbon neutrality.
If banks want to show that they are trustworthy and serious about the risks they and their shareholders face, they will use this AGM season to advance climate resolutions and remove expansion of fossil-fuel investment from their agendas.

The Secret Sex Lives of Crop Plants
ABERYSTWYTH – Scientists estimate that there are more than 400,000 species of plants on earth, at least half of which are edible for humans.
Indeed, it is entirely possible that we are capable of eating 300,000 plant species.
And yet we consume just a tiny fraction of that.
Homo sapiens, the most cosmopolitan of species, one that thrives by virtue of being a generalist, eats only about 200 plant species.
Remarkably, a mere three crops – maize, rice, and wheat – account for more than half of the calories and proteins that we derive from plants.
Strangely, there have been few attempts to explain why we consume so few of the species that are possible to eat.
Taste is not the answer.
Nor is nutritional value.
The plants we eat have been enhanced by generations of selection, in which farmers have favored those with the most palatability, the greatest nutritional value, and the highest yield.
As much as one might hate broccoli, it is likely to be far tastier than most of the 300,000 alternatives.
Wild plants taste like wild plants because they still are wild plants.
But why is that?
In Guns, Germs, and Steel, the geographer and science writer Jared Diamond argues that the explanation for our limited menu lies within the plants themselves.
Diamond argues that when agriculture was still in its infancy, our ancestors were remarkably efficient at identifying the very few species that were suitable for domestication – by which Diamond means not being poisonous.
The logic seems impeccable, and it is true that the vast majority of the planet’s 400,000 plant species do contain chemical defenses (poisons) to defend themselves from grazing herbivores.
But, unfortunately for Diamond’s theory, many of our most important crops are also stuffed full of toxins, to the extent that if they were introduced today, they would most likely be banned for human consumption.
Examples include the tomato, its relative the potato, and many other root crops, such as cassava, which contains cyanide; taro, which is full of oxalates; and yams, which produce defense chemicals that mimic female hormones.
Indeed, many of the plants we love to grow and eat, including chilies, mustard, horseradish, and wasabi, are attractive precisely because they are packed with potentially harmful chemicals.
What distinguishes food crops from other plants has nothing to do with taste, nutrition, or whether they contain poisons.
The plants we eat are atypical because of their particularly dull sex lives.
Many biologists believe that the reason there are so many species of flowering plants is that each has become dependent on a unique species of insects that coevolved to pollinate it.
In other words, these are plants with elaborate sex lives.
The more unusual the mechanism of insect pollination, the greater the genetic separation among plant populations becomes, almost as if they had evolved on different islands.
This explains why there are roughly 25,000 orchid species.
Orchids are the kinky exhibitionists of the botanical world.
Many of them have extremely elaborate flowers that have evolved to trick male bees or wasps into trying to copulate with them, thereby ensuring that they are regularly pollinated.
This explains why we don’t farm orchids for food.
Seducing bees and wasps might work well for a few individual flowers, but it would never work on an agricultural scale.
There would never be enough male wasps to pollinate an entire crop; and if there were, they would soon tire or wise up.
Furthermore, because wasps are not found everywhere, an orchid crop could never be pollinated outside its original range.
Most food crops, by contrast, can be pollinated by different types of insects.
They can be successfully cultivated around the world, using whatever insects are available to pollinate them.
The most common crops of all – wheat, maize, and rice – are grasses that rely on the wind for pollination.
Others, such as potatoes and yams, are spread vegetatively and are rarely propagated from seed at all, while some crops that would naturally be insect pollinated, such as oilseed rape, become wind pollinated when they are grown on an industrial scale.
A more adventurous plant diet is possible.
But it would have to accommodate the quirky sex lives of what we include in it.

The Global Economy in Transition
NEW YORK – Recent conversations about the global economy and markets have been defined by a set of recurring questions.
While there are many moving parts that are difficult to capture in a single clear picture, it is worth attempting to bring some of the biggest issues into better focus.
The first question is straightforward: Is a recession looming?
With authoritative growth forecasts like those from the International Monetary Fund having been revised significantly downward, and likely to be downgraded further, there is good reason to worry.
But a global recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth – remains unlikely, though a major shock, such as a dramatic expansion of conflict or a sudden and significant disruption in a key market like energy, could change this outlook.
Some economies, however, certainly will contract.
Russia’s GDP will surely shrink, even with higher oil and gas prices, as a result of severe and most likely prolonged Western sanctions.
Europe, too, is likely to experience a recession, owing to high energy prices, heavy dependence on fossil-fuel imports, and the (costly) imperative of rapidly weaning itself from Russian supplies.
And many lower-income countries – for which soaring food and energy prices are compounding the effects of the pandemic – are facing harder times.
While the United States appears increasingly likely to face a major economic slowdown, a recession is not the most likely scenario.
Similarly, China – normally a powerful engine of global growth – is set to experience low single-digit growth for at least a year, owing to the combined effects of COVID-19 lockdowns, low vaccination uptake among the elderly, some loss of investor confidence in high-growth tech sectors, and a real-estate sector beset by high debts and falling prices.
The second key question relates to the trajectory of inflation.
The proximate cause of recent price increases is supply-chain blockages and imbalances between supply and demand.
The war in Ukraine has intensified upward pressure on energy, commodities, and food prices.
Some of this will be transitory, though it will last longer than initially expected.
But inflation is also being fueled by secular trends that are not set to fade anytime soon.
Populations representing about 75% of the global economy are aging, labor-force participation is declining, and productivity growth is trending downward.
Moreover, unused productive capacity in developing economies – a key source of deflationary pressure in the past – is smaller than it used to be, and what there is remains unused.
Add to that a coming policy-driven diversification of supply and demand linkages – a response to myriad shocks, from the pandemic and climate change to geopolitical tensions and conflict – and an extended period of supply-constrained growth with embedded inflationary pressures seems likely.
The third recurring question is: What is next for the tech sector and the digital transformation it is propelling?
Lockdowns and other public-health measures spurred an acceleration in adoption of digital technologies during the pandemic.
But, contrary to market expectations, this trend is likely to slow as pandemic restrictions are removed.
Amid overly optimistic growth projections, equity markets produced valuations that would have been unrealistic in the best of times.
At a time of surging inflation, monetary tightening, and falling growth projections, markets have begun correcting.
Not surprisingly, growth stocks, whose value is derived from expected future cash flows, and which tend to be concentrated in the tech sector, have fallen particularly sharply.
These market gyrations do not mean that the digital, energy, and biomedical transformations that are underway lack substance, or that they will not have long-lasting economic effects.
Markets naturally tend to be more volatile than the underlying economic reality they are supposed to mirror.
Momentum incentives cause overshoots in both directions.
Higher market volatility will have important short-run consequences, because venture-capital and private-equity funding, which plays a vital role in supporting innovative, potentially high-growth companies, is not insulated from it.
During upswings, valuations are rich, and some companies with dubious claims to durable growth dynamics are funded.
During downswings, private valuations lag behind market adjustments by about 6-9 months (experts estimate), partly because both investors and companies resist adjusting valuations downward until the need to raise additional capital forces the issue.
(Even now, growth companies are being urged to cut costs and conserve capital.)
During this period, deal prices are out of line with realistic longer-term values, making funding difficult and impeding growth and innovation.
A final question that seems to be preoccupying minds lately is whether the war in Ukraine, Europe’s resolve to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas, and sky-high fossil-fuel prices will derail the low-carbon transition.
Fortunately, there are good reasons to think that it might not, at least not in a lasting way.
For starters, high fossil-fuel prices create a strong incentive for countries and consumers to boost energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy solutions.
In this sense, they go some way toward offsetting the failure to establish an effective global carbon-pricing scheme.
High fossil-fuel prices will have adverse distributional effects within and across countries, resembling the impact of a regressive tax.
But these effects can be mitigated, ideally through some form of income redistribution.
What governments should not do is subsidize fossil fuels by regulating final prices below market levels, as this would weaken the incentive to pursue more sustainable options.
There is a good argument for stabilizing energy prices to encourage investment in alternatives.
But that does not mean cutting off the peaks while leaving the troughs in place.
Geopolitics is also bolstering the clean-energy incentive: unlike fossil fuels, renewables largely do not create external dependencies.
The green transition is thus a powerful mechanism for increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability to the weaponization of energy supplies.
Ultimately, the green transition is a multi-decade process, during which the energy mix shifts gradually from fossil fuels to clean alternatives.
In the near term, economies – especially Europe – might resort to “dirty” energy, including coal, to meet their needs.
But this need not spell disaster for the energy transition, let alone the global sustainability agenda.

No Worker Left Behind
BERKELEY – A week rarely goes by without a new dystopian prediction about technologically driven mass unemployment.
As artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies advance faster than even their own developers expected, studies are finding that many of the tasks and occupations that employ people can already be automated.
Estimates of the share of automatable employment vary widely, from 14% of all jobs in OECD countries to nearly 50% of all jobs in the US.
According to the McKinsey Global Institute, 9-32% of the workforce in developed economies could be displaced within the next decade.
Across all countries, low-skilled occupations that require less formal education will be the most susceptible to automation, whereas jobs requiring professional training and/or tertiary education will be less threatened, at least for now.
Either way, we urgently need to start furnishing workers with new skills to meet future labor-market demands.
To that end, US businesses, educational institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and state and local governments have begun to rethink education and training policies.
Their work is made more urgent by the fact that the federal government under President Donald Trump is shirking its responsibilities in this area.
Meeting the skills challenge will require an epic reinvention of workforce learning and training.
The response must be on par with the establishment of universal secondary education a century ago, or with the “college for all” movement that began in the 1960s.
But it must be much faster, and it will have to be spearheaded by public-private partnerships.
This is not the first time the US has had to adapt to vast labor-market disruptions.
More than 150 years ago, the Morrill Act of 1862 established and endowed “land-grant universities” to educate Americans in agriculture, science, engineering, and other fields relevant to the Industrial Revolution.
After the Civil War, the Morrill Act was extended to the former confederate states.
The system it created would evolve into the world’s largest post-secondary education system, encompassing more than 100 colleges and universities.
Economists predict that technological change will eventually create as many jobs as it destroys. But there will be significant hurdles along the way.
As things stand, too many US workers lack the skills needed for the good jobs of the future.
Though around one-third of US adults have a four-year college degree – the highest proportion on record – an equal share has no more than a high-school diploma.
For workers at all educational levels, acquiring additional skills to stay abreast of technologically driven occupational changes will require less “seat-time” in traditional classrooms, and more dynamic forms of workforce training.
A good example of such training is offered by Skillful, a nonprofit venture supported by the Markle Foundation, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and the state of Colorado.
Skillful is running a pilot project in Colorado to help workers without a college degree upgrade and market their skills.
The idea is to focus both on job seekers and employers, and on skills rather than degrees.
For Skillful CEO Beth Cobert, the goal is to get employers to start appreciating “hard” skills, such as carpentry or web design, and “soft” skills in communication or leadership, even if such skills weren’t acquired in a formal setting, and to recognize workers’ potential for future development.
Workers can acquire many of these skills through new forms of training such as targeted certification programs, technology “boot camps,” apprenticeships, and on-the-job classes.
Skillful’s approach is premised on the fact that a true skills-based labor market requires collaboration among many players.
Employers and industry groups need to be in closer contact with educational institutions so that the skills being supplied meet current and future demand.
And state and local governments should do more to shine a spotlight on their jurisdictions’ competitive strengths and emerging opportunities.
“We’re trying to integrate all these participants in the labor market,” says Cobert, and they “typically aren’t talking that much with each other.”
According to the OECD, workers without a college degree are less likely to participate in any type of workforce training.
That is why Skillful is leveraging industry and geographical data to help workers discover marketable skills they already have, careers they might want, and places where they can pursue further professional development or new employment.
Making such information easily available online is crucial to encourage workers whose jobs are most at risk to explore their training options.
Moreover, Skillful and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper have launched an intensive program to train career coaches, who will then help individual workers identify the skills and training they need for the jobs they want.
And 20 state governors, both Republicans and Democrats, have created a Skillful State Network to collaborate on innovations in workforce development.
At this point, there are no right or wrong strategies, and it is heartening to see that many states are experimenting with different initiatives and sharing lessons learned.
They are showing that progressive federalism can work even in “red” (Republican) states.
For example, North Carolina has created a pathway program to support training for low-skill adults and out-of-school youth.
In Ohio, high-school graduates can obtain a rigorous “Professional Readiness” certification covering 15 skill areas.
Montana recently introduced a manufacturing apprenticeship program.
And Indiana’s “NextLevel” initiative provides grants to employers to train workers in “middle-skill” occupations (those requiring more than a high-school diploma but less than a two-year associate degree).
Twenty years ago, the governors of 19 states in the American West created Western Governors University to teach in-demand competencies online.
Today, nearly 100,000 students are enrolled, and California’s government is also proposing an online community college to serve “stranded workers.”
Given the high stakes for millions of workers, there is no alternative to such initiatives.
Policymakers should follow the lead of those who are already strengthening education and adult-learning programs so that no workers are left behind by the driving force of automation.

Nuclear Disarmament’s Asian Pivot
WASHINGTON, DC – In 2009, US President Barack Obama pledged to seek a world without nuclear weapons.
But, while he delivered on his promise to negotiate a New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia a year later, progress has since stalled.
To break the deadlock, the current bilateral framework for negotiation, which has remained largely unchanged since the Cold War, must be transformed into a trilateral framework that includes China.
To be sure, such a move would significantly complicate negotiations.
After all, while decades of bilateral dialogue have given the United States and Russia a good sense of each other’s strategic perspectives – including the issues on which they disagree – China’s perception of strategic stability is unfamiliar.
But trilateral dialogues, catalyzed by skillful US diplomacy, could also serve as an opportunity to manage the countries’ strategic relations, which currently are characterized by contradictions and mistrust.
Russia seeks China’s support in opposing American missile-defense systems, and calls for the involvement of all nuclear states in future strategic arms-control talks, but then cites concerns about China’s military modernization to justify its refusal to negotiate with NATO on tactical nuclear-weapon reduction.
China, which has never adopted legally binding limits on its nuclear weapons or strategic nuclear-delivery vehicles, rejects Russia’s call to join negotiations – a stance that the US supports until the Russian and US nuclear arsenals move closer in size to those of China.
At the same time, US officials deny that their country’s missile-defense programs are directed against Russia or China, but refuse to offer a legally binding guarantee.
And the US Department of Defense is developing a robust program of long-range conventional strike weapons, which China and Russia cite to justify their efforts to strengthen their offensive nuclear forces.
Although multilateral cooperation on nuclear issues has been effective in some cases, such as in ratifying the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it has been inadequate in others, such as in easing tensions with Iran and North Korea.
In fact, even when China, Russia, and the US share the same agenda, their differing diplomatic tactics often undermine their ability to achieve their objectives.
For example, the three countries’ policies are inadvertently contributing to proliferation pressures in Asia and Europe.
US pledges to defend Japan against a nuclear attack from China or North Korea have played a decisive role in dissuading the Japanese from seeking their own nuclear weapons.
Given this, a Chinese nuclear surge – even one that did not lead to US-China parity – could undermine the credibility of American deterrence commitments, possibly motivating Japan to launch its own nuclear program.
Similarly, some of NATO’s newer members, many of which are former Soviet-bloc states, are anxious about the prospect of Russian rearmament.
As a result, they oppose efforts to reduce the number of American nuclear weapons in Europe, part of NATO’s “nuclear sharing” policy.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to initiating a trilateral dialogue is Chinese resistance to formal nuclear arms-control agreements, which is rooted in the memory of Cold War-era nonproliferation initiatives aimed partly at preventing China from developing its own nuclear deterrent.
Since then, Chinese officials have insisted that they do not belong in US-Russian strategic-arms talks, because the two countries’ nuclear arsenals dwarf theirs.
But, as the US and Russia reduce their nuclear stockpiles, this excuse is becoming less valid, and China’s exclusion from negotiations is becoming an increasingly significant hindrance to disarmament.
Securing a binding commitment from China’s government to limit its nuclear development is crucial to reassuring the US and Russia that further strategic-weapons cuts will not undermine global or regional stability.
Several recent developments could help to minimize obstacles to trilateral cooperation.
China’s new leadership is further removed from Maoist-era reflexive opposition to nuclear negotiations; Russian leaders’ confidence in their economic and military resurgence is waning; and both countries are increasingly frustrated by the lack of progress in nuclear talks with North Korea and Iran.
Meanwhile, faced with a large federal budget deficit, many American voters would welcome reduced spending on nuclear weapons.
The US should capitalize on this situation, leveraging Russian concerns and interests to induce China to join strategic arms-control efforts.
China might be willing to make a unilateral, but enforceable, commitment not to augment its nuclear arsenal, if Russia and the US reduce theirs further.
Determining the circumstances that might induce such restraint – and the conditions that would be needed to sustain it – is crucial to reinvigorating nuclear disarmament efforts.
With Russia ostensibly on board, it is up to the US to initiate a transformation in the nuclear-negotiation framework – and that means convincing China to participate.

The Risk of Nuclear Disaster in Ukraine
LOS ANGELES – Russia’s large-scale military mobilization on Ukraine’s border has grim historic precedents.
But should the Kremlin pull the trigger, it will encounter a hazard that no invading army has ever faced before: 15 nuclear power reactors, which generate roughly 50% of Ukraine’s energy needs at four sites.
The reactors present a daunting specter.
If struck, the installations could effectively become radiological mines.
And Russia itself would be a victim of the ensuing wind-borne radioactive debris.
Given the vulnerability of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors and the human and environmental devastation that would follow if combat were to damage them, Russian President Vladimir Putin should think again about whether Ukraine is worth a war.
Power plants are common targets in modern conflict, because destroying them inhibits a country’s ability to carry on fighting.
But nuclear reactors are not like other energy sources.
They contain enormous amounts of radioactive material, which can be released in any number of ways.
Aerial bombing or artillery fire, for example, could break a reactor’s containment building or sever vital coolant lines that keep its core stable.
So, too, could a cyberattack that interrupts plant operations, as would a disruption of offsite power that nuclear plants rely on to keep functioning.
Were a reactor core to melt, explosive gases or belching radioactive debris would exit the containment structure.
Once in the atmosphere, the effluents would settle over thousands of miles, dumping light to very toxic radioactive elements on urban and rural landscapes.
And spent nuclear fuel could cause further devastation if storage pools were set afire.
The health consequences of such fallout would depend on the population exposed and the toxicity of the radioactive elements.
The UN Chernobyl Forum estimated that the 1986 Ukraine accident would inflict 5,000 excess cancer deaths over 50 years, though some environmental groups think that figure grossly understates the likely toll.
Indeed, thousands of thyroid cancers emerged in the years immediately following the accident.
In the midst of a pandemic that has killed millions, nuclear-reactor fatalities may seem trivial.
But that would be an unconscionable misreading of the risk.
To reduce the uptake of radiation that settled on the ground after Chernobyl, Soviet authorities had to relocate hundreds of thousands of people and remove large swaths of agricultural land and forests from production for decades.
In and around the reactor, 600,000 “liquidators” were deployed to clean up the site.
Engineers built a giant “sarcophagus” over the reactor building to contain further releases.
Millions of people suffered psychological trauma, and some seven million received social compensation.
Eventually, the economic losses mounted into the hundreds of billions of dollars.
Japan is still counting the hundreds of billions that the 2011 Fukushima disaster will cost, and that incident released only one-tenth of the radiation that Chernobyl did, mostly into the ocean.
A war would magnify these risks, because the reactor operators who might mitigate the fallout would be more prone to flee for fear of being shot or bombed.
If a reactor is in the middle of a chaotic battlefield, there may not even be any first responders, and ill-informed populations hearing rumors would be on their own wandering – and panicking – in contaminated zones.
After the guns went silent, Ukraine would be saddled with the long-lingering effects that follow from any nuclear accident.
And, as Chernobyl demonstrated, it would not be alone.
Radiation releases do not observe national borders, and Russia’s proximity would make it a sink for radioactive aerosol deposits.
Given Chernobyl’s legacy, one might think that Russia would shun attacks on operating reactors.
And avoidance is indeed the historic norm.
True, Israel has attacked Syrian and Iraqi suspected nuclear-weapons plants, and Iraq bombarded two reactors in Bushehr, Iran, during the 1980s war.
But in those cases, the plants were still under construction.
There have also been instances when attacks on operating nuclear power plants were considered: Serbia weighed a strike against Slovenia’s Krško nuclear plant early in the Balkan War, and Azerbaijan contemplated attacking Armenia’s Metsamor plant in the 2020 war.
But there are other cases when only dumb luck, rather than reason, prevailed.
These include Iraq’s failed Scud attacks on Israel’s Dimona weapons reactor during the Gulf War and the US strike on a small research reactor at Iraq’s Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center outside Baghdad during the same conflict.
Ukrainian anxieties about its nuclear vulnerability bubbled up in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea.
Concerned that further conflict could result in a reactor attack, it appealed to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Security Summit to help boost its defenses.
Unfortunately, there is no defense that can withstand a Russian bombardment.
Is a reactor strike a bridge too far for Putin to cross?
Russia’s combat behavior since the breakup of the Soviet Union gives cause for concern.
In the Afghan, Chechen, and Syrian wars, Russian forces acted with scant regard for conventional boundaries.
Then there are the vagaries of war generally.
Bad stuff happens; combatants make mistakes; soldiers in the field ignore restraints.
A case in point was the March 26, 2017, bombing of the Islamic State-held Tabqa Dam in Syria.
Standing 18 stories high and holding back a 25-mile-long reservoir on the Euphrates River, the dam’s destruction would have drowned tens of thousands of innocent people downstream.
Yet, violating strict “no-strike” orders and bypassing safeguards, US airmen struck it anyway.
Dumb luck saved the day again: the bunker-busting bomb failed to detonate.
For the Kremlin, the lesson ought to be clear.
Invading Ukraine poses the risk of a radiological disaster that will affect not only the host country but also Russia itself.
No war of choice merits such a gamble.

Story Time for the World Economy
NEW HAVEN - Since hitting bottom in early March, the world’s major stock markets have all risen dramatically.
Some, notably in China and Brazil, reached lows last fall and again in March, before rebounding sharply, with Brazil’s Bovespa up 75% in May compared to late October 2008, and the Shanghai Composite up 54% in roughly the same period.
But the stock market news just about everywhere has been very good since March.
Does this suggest that the world economic crisis is coming to an end?
Could it be that everyone becomes optimistic again at the same time, bringing a quick end to all our problems?
Speculative booms are driven by psychological feedback.
Rising stock prices generate stories of smart investors getting rich.
People become envious of others’ successes, and begin to wonder if rising prices don’t portend further increases.
A temptation arises to get into the market, even among people who are fundamentally doubtful that the boom will continue.
So rising prices feed back into more rising prices, and the cycle repeats again and again – for a while.
During a boom, people considering getting into asset markets weigh the fear of regret if they don’t against the pain of possible loss if they do.
There is no authoritative answer about what the “right” decision is, and no consensus among experts about the proper level of exposure to these markets.
Should it be 30% in stocks and 70% in housing?
Or the reverse?
Who knows?
So the ultimate human decision must be based on the relative salience of these discordant emotional factors.
In a boom environment, the emotional factors are biased toward getting into the market.
But one must ask what would sustain such a movement now.
There seems to be no dramatic fundamental news since March other than the price increases themselves.
The human tendency to react to price increases is always there waiting to generate booms and bubbles. The feedback is only an amplification mechanism for other factors that predispose people to want to get into the markets.
The whole world can’t recover all of the enthusiasm of a few years ago from feedback alone, for there is a giant coordination problem: we are not all attentive to price increases at the same time, so we make decisions to buy at very different times.
As a result, things happen slowly, and, meanwhile, more bad news may be revealed.
The only way world confidence can return dramatically is if our thinking coordinates around some inspiring story beyond that of the price increases themselves.
In my 2009 book with George Akerlof, Animal Spirits , we describe the ups and downs of a macroeconomy as being substantially driven by stories .
Such narratives, especially those fueled by accessible human-interest stories, are the thought viruses whose contagion drives the economy. The contagion rate of stories depends on their relation to feedback, but plausible stories have to be there in the first place.
The narratives have substantial persistence in that they affect our views.
The story that drove the worldwide stock-market bubble that peaked in 2000 was complex, but, put crudely, it was that bright, aggressive people were leading the way to a new era of capitalist glory in a rapidly globalizing economy.
Such people became new entrepreneurs and world travelers on the way to prosperity.
This narrative seemed plausible to casual observers, because it was tied to millions of little human-interest stories about the obvious successes of those – friends, neighbors, and family members – who had the vision to participate enthusiastically in the new environment.
But it is hard today to re-create such a narrative, given so many stories of trouble.
The stock markets’ rebound since March seems not to be built around any inspirational story, but rather the mere absence of more really bad news and the knowledge that all previous recessions have come to an end.
At a time when the newspapers are filled with pictures of foreclosure sales – and even of surplus homes being demolished – it is hard to see any cause for the markets’ rebound other than this “all recessions come to an end sooner or later” story.
Indeed, the “capitalists triumphant” story is tarnished, as is our faith in international trade.
So, here is the problem: there isn’t a plausible driver of a dramatic recovery.
Starting an economic recovery is like launching a new movie: nobody knows how people will react to it until people actually get to see it and talk about it among themselves.
The new movie Star Trek , based on yet another remake of a television show from more than 40 years ago, surprised everyone by raking in $76.5 million on its first weekend.
That old story just got some excitement back with this new movie.
Similarly, we have to hope that some of the same old stories that propelled us in the past – the rise of capitalism and its internationalization throughout the world economy – can somehow be dusted off and revived yet again to invigorate the animal spirits that drive economic recovery.
Our efforts to stimulate the economy should be focused on improving the script for those stories, making these stories believable again.
This means making capitalism work better, and making it clear that there is no threat of protectionism.
But the rationale must be to get the world economy out of its current risky situation, not to propel us into yet another speculative bubble.

The Right Way to Beat Chinese Inflation
WASHINGTON, DC – High inflation is threatening social stability in China, soaring from 3.3% in March 2007 to 8.3% in March 2008.
As a result, the People’s Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks’ reserve requirements.
The trick for the Chinese government will be to quell inflation in a way that does not compromise its long-term goal of continued strong economic growth.
The risks are high.
China’s accelerating inflation reflects a similar climb in its GDP growth rate, from the already high 11% in 2006 to 11.5 % in 2007.
The proximate cause of price growth since mid-2007 is the appearance of production bottlenecks as domestic demand exceeds supply in an increasing number of sectors, such as power generation, transportation, and intermediate-goods industries.
Sustained robust growth and rising aggregate demand have also caused production bottlenecks outside of China, most notably in the agricultural commodity and mining sectors, which have helped lift oil prices to more than $100 per barrel.
Adding to these woes are two other inflationary factors: first, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS, or “blue-ear disease”) has been killing pigs – China’s main meat source – nationwide, and, second, terrible storms in January reduced the supply of grain and vegetables.
In these circumstances, continuing to raise borrowing costs would be a mistake.
To be sure, the prolonged rapid increase in Chinese aggregate demand has been fueled by an investment boom, as well as a growing trade surplus.
Thus, lowering inflation would require reducing the growth rate (if not the level) of these two demand components.
But Chinese policymakers should focus more on reducing the trade surplus and less on reducing investment spending – that is, they should emphasize renminbi (RMB) appreciation over higher interest rates to cool the economy.
A sizeable reduction in aggregate demand through RMB appreciation is achievable without being imprudent, because the current-account surplus in 2007 was 9.5 % of GDP.
Investment (especially in infrastructure in backward areas and social investments) should not bear the brunt of the expenditure squeeze, because today’s investment is also tomorrow’s growth in production capacity; and the production of more goods tomorrow would reduce inflation.
Using RMB appreciation as the primary tool to fight inflation implies accepting a temporarily higher unemployment rate now in exchange for a permanently lower unemployment rate in the future.
This is because manufactured exports are typically more labor-intensive than investment projects.
As a result, a RMB1 billion reduction in exports would create more unemployment than a RMB1 billion reduction in investment spending.
But tomorrow’s capacity expansion from today’s investment would mean a permanent increase in the number of jobs created from tomorrow onward.
Nevertheless, China must be careful when implementing RMB appreciation.
Policy makers should closely monitor potential changes in the economic conditions in the G-7.
A deep recession in the United States resulting from the sub-prime crisis would significantly lower Chinese exports and cut the prices of oil and other primary commodities.
In that case, a large RMB appreciation undertaken now would be overkill.
Moreover, the authorities should recognize that RMB appreciation is unlikely to reduce US-China trade tensions.
Consider the experience of Japan-bashing in the 1980’s, when the Yen-Dollar end-year exchange rate plunged from 248 in 1984 to 162 in 1986, and then to 123 in 1988.
While Japan’s overall current-account surplus declined significantly, from 3.7% of GDP in 1985 to 2.7% in 1988, the overall US current-account deficit only fell from 2.8% of GDP to 2.4%, because Japanese companies started investing in production facilities in Southeast Asia for export to the US.
So Japan-bashing continued under a new guise: the additional demand that Japan must remove its “structural impediments” to import.
In short, substantial RMB appreciation would reduce the bilateral US-China trade deficit and China’s overall trade surplus significantly, but it would do little to reduce the overall US trade deficit.
In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies, possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit.
A stronger RMB can help only the overheated Chinese economy.
And it has the virtue of doing so without hurting China’s future production capacity.

Europe and the Global Food Crisis
PARIS – The world has been shaken by unprecedented spikes in food prices, by hunger riots, and by social tensions that demonstrate that food supplies have returned as a source of insecurity – to which global warming and declining natural resources are adding unprecedented urgency.
By 2050, it is estimated that there will be nine billion people on earth, so the need for food may double – primarily among urban populations in the world’s poorest countries.
But there is more to finding a solution than simply identifying those nations that are capable of feeding the rest of the world.
It is increasingly urgent that every nation gain the means of feeding itself.
This means that agriculture should become an international priority, with the poorest countries helped to safeguard the security and independence of their food supplies.
Countries and organizations are already mobilizing.
The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization argues that rising food prices could lead to increasing global conflicts.
The Davos World Economic Forum ranks food insecurity as a major risk to humanity.
The World Bank has forcefully emphasized the importance of agriculture to jump-starting economic expansion and breaking the cycle of poverty.
UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon has created a working group to define a common plan of action, and France’s President Nicolas Sarkozy has proposed a global partnership for food.
Sarkozy’s proposed partnership has three pillars.
First, an international group should draft a worldwide strategy for food security.
Second, an international scientific platform should be charged with evaluating the world’s agricultural situation, sending out warnings of upcoming crises, and possibly facilitating governments’ adoption of political and other strategic tools to deal with food crises.
Finally, the international finance community, despite its current problems, must be mobilized.
The reliability and size of the European Union’s farm output means that it can and should play the role of regulator in global markets.
If Europe cut back on its agricultural production, the increase in its own food imports would contribute significantly to a worldwide increase in food prices.
This makes it imperative that EU food production levels be held steady – for the sake of Europeans and of people in the world’s poorest countries.
But Europe cannot build up its own agriculture to the detriment of the less fortunate.
So the EU must harmonize its policies with poorer countries.
At present, export subsidies and support payments represent less than 1% of the European agricultural budget, and the EU has undertaken to eliminate them once it receives reciprocal undertakings from major food-exporting countries.
Since 2001, with the “Everything but Arms” initiative, all products from poor countries – with the exception of weapons and munitions – can enter the EU single market on a duty-free basis.
This has led to the EU becoming the primary market for the poorest countries’ products.
The EU is also developing ways to respond to new global challenges through changes to its Common Agricultural Policy.
This was reflected in the decision to suspend the “set aside” rule that requires a proportion of agricultural land to lie fallow.
Now the EU is preparing to increase dairy quotas progressively, and evaluating the impact on world markets of its decisions regarding bio-fuels.
But Europe’s focus must be on encouraging the development of local agriculture.
Doing so is the only way to achieve greater global food security and reduce poverty.
It will also make it possible to ensure that today’s high prices for agricultural products are transformed into opportunity for poor farmers.
This is vital because, according to the World Bank, growth in farming eliminates poverty twice as much as growth in any other economic sector.
Indeed, agriculture remains the primary productive sector in the world’s poorest countries, employing 65% of the working population and, on average, contributing more than 25% to GDP.
But over the past 20 years, support for agricultural development has been declining.
Only 4% of public development assistance is now earmarked for agriculture.
The European Commission and EU member states are therefore planning to increase their assistance, both through the European Development Fund and by developing new sources of financial support.
Further liberalization of farm trade will not ensure food security.
Faced with the erratic nature of agricultural markets, regulation is needed to soften the impact on poorer countries of volatile food prices.
This does not mean that protectionism is the way forward, only that taking account of specific issues that affect international farm trade – weather, price volatility, or health risks – may be necessary from time to time.
But, in a world where productivity differentials can be as great as one to 1,000, it would be unwise to rely on markets alone to enable the poorest countries to expand their economies.
Nor is it likely that much economic expansion will result from competition between multinational food distributors and producers in countries where famine still stalks the land.
Instead, bringing together outside expertise and local knowledge of the geography and environmental and economic constraints in order to spread risks and share the management of resources and projects is far more likely to help poor countries achieve food independence.
It was such an approach that, in less than 20 years, helped postwar Europe achieve food sovereignty.
Countries that have protected their agricultural development from the threats posed by international markets – such as India or Vietnam – have achieved substantial reductions in agricultural poverty.
The time has also come to prioritize agriculture in order to ensure growth with a more human face.
At the heart of the EU, France wants to play its part in a collective effort that is fast becoming a major issue for us all.

Egypt’s Innocent Murderers
CAIRO – “Bashar should abandon power and retire safely in Egypt.
The general-prosecutor is murder-friendly,” a friend, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, told me as we watched former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s trial in the Police Academy’s criminal court.
Although Mubarak and his interior (security) minister, Habib al-Adly, were handed life sentences at the conclusion of their trials, the generals who ran Egypt’s apparatus of repression as deputy interior ministers were acquitted.
Hasan Abd al-Rahman, head of the notorious, Stasi-like State Security Investigations (SSI); Ahmad Ramzi, head of the Central Security Forces (CSF); Adly Fayyid, the head of Public Security; Ismail al-Shaer, who led the Cairo Security Directorate (CSD); Osama Youssef, the head of the Giza Security Directorate; and Omar Faramawy, who oversaw of the 6th of October Security Directorate, were all cleared of any wrongdoing.
Lawyers for Mubarak and al-Adly will appeal their life-sentences, and many Egyptians believe that they will receive lighter sentences.
The verdicts sent an unmistakable message, one with serious consequences for Egypt’s political transition.
A spontaneous cry was heard from the lawyers and the families of victims when they were announced: “The people want to cleanse the judiciary.”
Indeed, many Egyptians – including senior judges – do not view the judiciary as an independent institution.
“This is a major professional mistake.
Those generals should have been handed life-sentences like Mubarak,” said Zakaria Abd al-Aziz, the former elected head of the Judges Club. “The killing went on for days, and they did not order anyone to stop it.
The Ministry of Interior (MOI) is not the only place that should be cleansed.
The judiciary needs that” as well.
The verdicts certainly reinforce a culture of impunity within the security services.
The SSI and its departments were responsible for many human-rights violations, including mass-torture and extra-judicial killings, throughout Mubarak’s 30-year rule.
When protestors stormed the SSI headquarters and other governorates in March 2011, torture rooms and equipment were found in every building.
Unlawful detentions, kidnappings, disappearances, systematic torture, rape, and inhuman prison conditions have all been documented since the 1980’s by human-rights organizations and a few Egyptian courts.
Acquitting the heads of the SSI and the CSF (the 300,000-strong institution that acted as the “muscle” of Mubarak’s regime), after a revolution sparked by police brutality, led directly to renewed protests in Tahrir Square.
“We either get the rights of the martyrs, or die like them,” chanted hundreds of thousands in Tahrir and other Egyptian squares.
Sit-ins, reminiscent of the 18 days of January and February 2011 that ended Mubarak’s rule, have already started.
A third consequence of the verdicts concerns the empowerment of an anti-reform faction within the MOI.
Based on my year-long research on Egyptian security-sector reform, this faction is already the most powerful.
Following the revolution, factional struggle within the MOI became public.
“We have to save face,” said General Abd al-Latif Badiny, a deputy interior minister who was fired under al-Adly.
“[M]any officers and commanders refused to torture detainees and were against corruption, but we need a revolutionary president to empower us and clean the ministry.”
Badiny was reappointed after the revolution, but then reprimanded in November 2011, following clashes between demonstrators and police that left more than 40 protesters dead.
“He was advocating dialogue with protesters, whereas al-Adly’s men wanted a harsh crackdown.
They got their way in the end,” says Major Ahmad Ragab, the spokesperson of the reformist General Coalition of Police Officers (GCPO), which seeks to establish an official police syndicate and reform the security services along apolitical, professional lines.
The verdicts will significantly affect two other processes: revolutionary forces’ capacity to mobilize, and thus to place pressure on the ruling Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), and the presidential elections.
The objectives of those protesting the verdicts in Tahrir and other squares include: a judicial purge; a law that would ban Mubarak’s senior officials from holding political posts for ten years; new trials for al-Aldy’s generals; and removal of the general prosecutor (who was appointed by Mubarak).
There are also calls, still undeveloped, for greater unity ahead of the presidential run-off election on June 16-17.
Such appeals range from demanding an immediate transfer of power to a coalition of revolutionary presidential candidates (although the mechanism is vague) to the formation of a united presidential front in the runoff, with Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brothers (MB) as President and left-leaning Nasserist Hamadin Sabahi and liberal-leaning moderate-Islamist Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh as Vice-Presidents.
MPs have already called on the three figures to come to the parliament and negotiate a coalition.
The verdicts are likely to boost support in the runoff for Morsi, who split the Islamist vote with two other candidates in the election’s first round.
Moreover, a significant share of the non-Islamist revolutionary vote will go to Morsi, owing to the absence of other revolutionary alternatives.
The common saying in Tahrir is: “We’ve got differences with Morsi, but we’ve got blood with [Ahmed] Shafiq,” Mubarak’s last prime minister and Morsi’s opponent in the runoff.
Pro-revolution, non-Islamist, and non-MB candidates received almost 9.7 million votes in the first round of the presidential election.
The majority of these voters will probably now support Morsi, as opposed to staying home (the general drift before the verdicts).
The MB must still decide for inclusiveness if it wants to attract the support of Aboul Fotouh and Sabahi voters in the runoff against Shafiq.
But, for now, Tahrir and other squares are once again uniting the pro-change forces, whether Islamist or not.
The key challenge for Egyptian revolutionaries is to sustain that unity, establish a leadership coalition, translate their chants into concrete demands, and maintain the pressure during implementation.
Egypt’s revolution continues.

A V-Shaped Recovery Could Still Happen
LONDON – Since March, I have been more open than other commentators to the possibility of a “V-shaped” recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn (though I have also consistently warned of structural challenges facing many economies in the decade ahead).
Wherever I have expressed this optimism, I have met with pushback, given the apparent depth and scale of the current crisis.
And yet, as we move into July, many classic short-term leading and coincident indicators still point to a V-shaped recovery, as does the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane.
Despite the complications thrown up by COVID-19, the same weekly and monthly indicators that I have long relied on remain useful for separating signal from noise.
During my early days as chief economist for Goldman Sachs, I helped to develop a “Global Leading Indicator” (GLI) index, which was designed to be equally accurate but faster than the OECD’s longstanding index, as well as more predictive of financial-market behavior.
Since leaving the financial industry seven years ago, I have continued to monitor the publicly available components of the GLI each month. These include US manufacturing purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs); new orders relative to inventories; US weekly unemployment claims; the Belgian business-confidence survey; and South Korean monthly export figures.
And for additional hints about the state of the global economy, one can also follow well-known PMI surveys from other countries, as well as monthly surveys like the Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany.
Crucially, many similar indicators are available for China, and are generally more reliable than that country’s critics would have one believe.
In addition to these short-term leading and coincident indicators are those concerning financial conditions more broadly.
From late February through March, when COVID-19 was bearing down on South Korea and Italy, financial markets reacted to the widespread realization that the crisis would reach pandemic proportions. Equity markets suffered a sharp decline, and global financial conditions tightened significantly.
As a result, all of the aforementioned high-frequency indicators duly collapsed.
In March and April, South Korean exports declined sharply, PMI indicators collapsed everywhere, and unemployment in many countries (not least the United States) skyrocketed, despite dramatic initiatives by many governments to soften the blow.
These trends followed predictably from the sudden spread of COVID-19 across the developed world, where infection rates shot up and economies locked down.
Since then, the pandemic has been rampaging across emerging and developing economies as well as large parts of the US.
The sheer scale of the public-health emergency, combined with the unprecedented experience of economy-wide lockdown measures, has lent a dramatic and apocalyptic quality to the crisis. It is not surprising that many people would question an optimistic perspective.
Nonetheless, the current high-frequency indicators suggest that a V-shaped recovery remains possible. After all, governments around the world have mustered an absolutely massive economic-policy response, intervening with remarkable monetary and fiscal measures.
Already, many governments have vastly exceeded the scale of the response to the 2008-10 global financial crisis and recession.
True, policymakers have been focused more on containing the immediate health and economic emergencies than on stimulus; but many of the most important crisis-response initiatives will continue to have a lasting effect.
For example, subsidized furlough schemes to sustain household incomes through the worst of the lockdown have, in many cases, boosted savings rates, which will translate into increased spending in the future (circumstances permitting). And that is just one among many reasons why financial-market indices have risen sharply in recent weeks.
These may not be normal times, but, ordinarily, such a snap-back would suggest an economic recovery.
Moreover, many of the key high-frequency indicators also are improving – some markedly so.
Two consecutive months of US employment data and monthly PMI indicators across the US, Europe, and Asia are all pointing up.
Notably, despite China’s ongoing challenges, the Caixin services PMI index rose to a ten-year high of 58.4 in June.
And for those who doubt the validity of Chinese data, it is worth remembering that the same index fell to a low of 26.5 in February.
Moreover, South Korean exports were substantially stronger than in previous months (though they were still 11% lower year on year).
Obviously, all of this movement toward a V-shaped recovery is provisional.
If major economies are forced to shut down again, key high-frequency indicators and broader financial conditions will doubtless take another turn for the worse.
But if lockdowns remain localized and temporary, if health systems continue to expand testing, and especially if a vaccine or more effective treatments are developed, the economic outlook need not be as bleak as many believe.
If a V-shaped recovery does arrive, it will be important to shift attention to other issues, such as the quality of future growth.
We must not repeat the mistakes of 2009-10, when the recovery left much to be desired in terms of productivity gains and inclusion.
Policymakers will need to think much more imaginatively and radically than they did a decade ago. But that is a topic for another commentary.

Triangulating Brexit
BRUSSELS – More than 100 days after the United Kingdom voted narrowly to leave the European Union, it remains far from clear what arrangement will regulate cross-Channel trade after Brexit.
Political discussions tend to revolve around three key issues: immigration controls, access to the single market, and passporting rights for financial services.
Which balance should European leaders strike?
Many in Britain know exactly what they want: to impose controls on the movement of workers from the rest of the EU, thereby protecting the domestic labor market, but without losing access to the single market or passporting rights, which allow British firms to sell their financial services on the continent.
That was, after all, the kind of deal many leaders of the “Leave” campaign promised before the June referendum.
But the Brexiteers’ promise remains wishful thinking.
As German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has pointed out, access to the single market is inextricably linked to the free movement of people.
Indeed, he has even offered to send Boris Johnson, the UK’s foreign secretary, a copy of the Treaty of Lisbon, where that link is established.
This may sound legalistic, and it certainly reflects political motivations.
But basic economic principles imply that free movement is, indeed, at least as important as free trade.
Trade usually benefits both sides.
It is thus clear that it is in the common interest of the UK and the EU to minimize the losses from the introduction of new barriers through Brexit.
From the point of view of European welfare, it is the size of the trade barriers that matters, not which side is a net exporter or importer.
Low barriers typically have low costs, unless very large volumes of trade are affected.
But as barriers become higher, the negative impact on welfare grows disproportionately.
The good news for the UK is that it probably wouldn’t face substantially higher trade barriers even if it did leave the single market.
After all, the EU has, in general, a liberal trade regime, with low external tariffs.
That is why so many studies do not consider the economic benefits of tariff-free transatlantic trade as the primary reason for pursuing it.
Even if the UK faced some additional barriers – such as new customs requirements and certificates of origin – their impact would most likely be relatively small.
The case of Switzerland – which is even more integrated into EU production chains than the UK – shows that efficient customs administrations on both sides are enough to keep such barriers to a minimum.
In any case, exports of goods to the EU generate only about 6% of the UK’s GDP.
Yet another reason why the introduction of some low trade barriers is unlikely to produce large losses is that the differences in the cost of producing goods in one market or the other are small.
Producing a car in Britain, for example, costs about the same as producing one in Germany.
Barriers to the free movement of labor are a different story.
Productivity and income per worker in the UK remains significantly higher than in, say, Poland.
A worker would get about €25 ($27.70) for an hour of work in the UK, but only €8.50 in Poland.
In other words, not allowing a Polish worker to work in the UK would imply large economic costs for Europe.
Moreover, if British Prime Minister Theresa May follows through on her stated goal of reducing annual net immigration to less than 100,000, the UK would have to implement drastic – potentially costly – measures to close off the UK labor market.
This means that the barriers that EU negotiators are in a position to impose – which largely affect trade in goods – are likely to have a much smaller impact than the UK-imposed barriers, such as quotas on EU workers.
But there is one more issue that negotiators must consider: financial services.
While overall trade in services is unlikely to suffer enormously from Brexit – the internal market for services never worked all that well, anyway – finance constitutes a special case, largely because of the passporting arrangements for banks.
Economists are often ambivalent about the benefits of financial integration, not least because large flows of bank credit can have a serious impact on macroeconomic stability.
Whereas securitization, for example, can help to reduce risk and increase the availability of credit for risky borrowers under the right framework, the 2008 global financial crisis starkly demonstrated that it can imply huge costs if it goes too far.
But steps can be taken to maximize the benefits of cross-Channel provision of financial services after Brexit.
The key is to base decisions not on sustaining the City of London’s role as Europe’s financial hub, but on ensuring that the services provided strengthen Europe’s capital markets.
That would require an emphasis on equity over debt instruments, and on market-based financing over bank credit.
From an economic standpoint, the priorities that should guide Brexit negotiations are clear.
Negotiators must focus on minimizing new barriers to the free movement of labor; indeed, this should be an even higher priority than maintaining the free movement of goods.
And British financial services should be welcomed in the EU, but only if they help it to move away from its bank-centric system and complete the capital market union.
But politics continues to distort discussions, driving leaders to draw red lines on free movement and adopt mercantilist stances on financial services.
It will take some statesmanship on both sides to shift attention to the common good.

Making Sense of China’s Growth Model
SHANGHAI – Although China’s economy has expanded at a staggering pace over the last three decades, its growth model is now widely agreed to be exhausted.
Even China’s top leadership acknowledges the need for change – a belief that culminated in the far-reaching reform agenda presented two months ago at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee.
While not everyone agrees on exactly what the new growth model should look like, proposals do not differ drastically, given the prevailing consensus that the current model rests on an unsustainable foundation.
On the demand side, many economists endorse a shift from investment-led to consumption-driven growth.
Even more popular is the supply-side recommendation of a shift from extensive to intensive growth – that is, from a model based on capital accumulation to one propelled by gains in efficiency, measured by total factor productivity (TFP).
These recommendations are presumably influenced by Paul Krugman’s criticism in 1994 of Soviet-style extensive growth in East Asian economies (especially Singapore).
At the time, Jeffery Sachs disagreed, asserting that the East Asian model included far more efficient market-based investment allocation than the Soviet model did, and thus was unique; nonetheless, the criticism stuck.
It was not long before some Chinese economists began to categorize the growth pattern brought about three decades ago by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms as “extensive” – and thus problematic.
A consensus has gradually emerged around this idea, with calls for a shift toward intensive, efficiency-driven growth intensifying since China’s GDP growth began to slow in 2011.
But empirical research reveals a fundamental problem with this argument: China’s TFP has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 4% since Deng’s reforms began.
If the United States’ economy, with a TFP growth rate of only 1-2% annually, is considered efficiency-driven, why is China’s not?
More important, if China’s TFP growth is expected to slow, as major drivers like the convergence effect wane, what does it mean to say that efficiency gains should propel China’s future growth?
Consider the facts.
A conservative assessment by Louis Kuijs, working with the World Bank, shows that, from 1978 to 1994, China’s GDP grew by an average of 9.9% annually, labor productivity increased by 6.4%, TFP rose by 3%, and the capital-labor ratio increased by 2.9%.
In the period from 1994 to 2009, annual GDP growth averaged 9.6%, labor productivity increased by 8.6%, TFP increased by 2.7%, and the capital-labor ratio rose by 5.5%.
Similarly, Dwight Perkins and Tom Rawski found that from 1978 to 2005, China’s GDP grew by 9.5%, while capital investment grew by 9.6%, contributing 44.7% to GDP.
The share of tertiary graduates in the labor force rose to 2.7% by 2005, accounting for 16.2% of GDP growth.
And TFP grew by 3.8%, adding 40.1% to GDP growth.
While capital has been the largest contributor to China’s GDP, the economy’s TFP performance has been impressive – something that cannot be explained by an extensive growth pattern.
Indeed, Japan’s rate of TFP growth never reached such high levels, even at the country’s economic peak.
Even Hong Kong – the East Asian economy with the best TFP performance – registered only 2.4% average annual TFP growth from 1960 to 1990.
But annual TFP growth is not the only relevant figure. China’s TFP has contributed 35-40% to GDP growth, compared to an estimated 20-30% in East Asia’s “four tigers” (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan).
As for the Soviet Union, even in its best years, TFP accounted for only about 10% of GDP growth.
Though China’s TFP contribution to GDP growth is much greater than in the other so-called “extensive” economies, it remains well below levels in the intensive US economy, where the figure exceeds 80% – a divergence that some might use to justify their refusal to define China’s economy as “efficiency-driven.”
But this argument ignores the fact that China has been experiencing double-digit annual GDP growth, owing largely to capital expansion, while America’s annual GDP growth has averaged only 2-3%.
If transforming China’s growth pattern were simply a matter of increasing TFP’s contribution to GDP to US levels, China’s annual GDP growth would have to drop to below 5% – three percentage points lower than its potential growth rate.
Given 8% GDP growth, TFP would have to grow 6.4% annually.
This is almost certainly impossible, owing to the gradual diminution of the major drivers – including market-oriented economic reforms, the convergence effect on per capita income, and the adoption of foreign technologies – of China’s extraordinary TFP growth over the last 30 years.
All of this raises a simple question: Do extensive- or intensive-growth models really exist?
Perhaps there is only fast versus slow, or extraordinary versus ordinary.
According to this view, if a developing economy can realize extraordinary growth, it must be because it offers greater opportunities for capital expansion than a developed economy.
After all, investment opportunity is inversely proportional to per capita capital stock.
On this point, Krugman is right: such investment-fueled growth is achieved largely through perspiration, rather than inspiration.
But so what?
The fact that some of Asia’s most dynamic economies – including China, Japan, and the four tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) – have experienced investment-propelled growth and improvements in TFP simultaneously can be explained by the fact that TFP gains increase investment returns, accelerating capital expansion further.
Though further analysis is needed to elucidate the long-term relationship between capital expansion and TFP, it is clear that the long-accepted theory that they cannot co-exist is seriously flawed.
In short, when it comes to Asian economies, the dichotomy of extensive and intensive growth is a red herring.
A far more meaningful consideration is what drove these TFP gains; understanding that would enable China’s leaders to design a more effective plan for strengthening the economy’s long-term growth prospects.

The War with Radical Islam
NEW YORK – French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was not speaking metaphorically when he said that France is at war with radical Islam.
There is, indeed, a full-fledged war underway, and the heinous terrorist attacks in Paris were part of it.
Yet, like most wars, this one is about more than religion, fanaticism, and ideology.
It is also about geopolitics, and its ultimate solution lies in geopolitics as well.
Crimes like those in Paris, New York, London, and Madrid – attacks on countless cafes, malls, buses, trains, and nightclubs – affront our most basic human values, because they involve the deliberate murder of innocents and seek to spread fear throughout society.
We are wont to declare them the work of lunatics and sociopaths, and we feel repulsed by the very idea that they may have an explanation beyond the insanity of their perpetrators.
Yet, in most cases, terrorism is not rooted in insanity.
It is more often an act of war, albeit war by the weak rather than by organized states and their armies.
Islamist terrorism is a reflection, indeed an extension, of today’s wars in the Middle East.
And with the meddling of outside powers, those wars are becoming a single regional war – one that is continually morphing, expanding, and becoming increasingly violent.
From the jihadist perspective – the one that American or French Muslims, for example, may pick up in training camps in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen – daily life is ultra-violent.
Death is pervasive, coming as often as not from the bombs, drones, and troops of the United States, France, and other Western powers.
And the victims are often the innocent “collateral damage” of Western strikes that hit homes, weddings, funerals, and community meetings.
We in the West hate to acknowledge – and most refuse to believe – that our leaders have been flagrantly wasteful of Muslim lives for a century now, in countless wars and military encounters instigated by overwhelming Western power.
What is the message to Muslims of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003?
More than 100,000 Iraqi civilians – a very conservative estimate – died in a war that was based on utterly false pretenses.
The US has never apologized, much less even recognized the civilian slaughter.
Or consider Syria, where an estimated 200,000 Syrians have recently died, 3.7 million have fled the country, and 7.6 million have been internally displaced in a civil war that was stoked in no small part by the US, Saudi Arabia, and other allied powers.
Since 2011, the CIA and US allies have poured in weapons, finance, and training in an attempt to topple President Bashar al-Assad.
For the US and its allies, the war is little more than a proxy battle to weaken Assad’s patrons, Iran and Russia.
Yet Syrian civilians are the cannon fodder.
Long before there was Islamist terrorism in the West, the United Kingdom, France, and the US relied on diplomatic chicanery and launched coups, wars, and covert operations in the Middle East to assert and maintain Western political control over the region.
Historians know this sordid story, but most Westerners do not (in no small part because many of the interventions have been covert).
Since the fall of the Ottoman Empire a century ago, Western powers have sought to control the Middle East for a variety of reasons, including claims on oil, access to international sea routes, Israel’s security, and geopolitical competition with Russia in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Iran.
The US now has more than 20 military bases in six countries in the region (Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Turkey) and large-scale military deployments in many others, including Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.
It has funded violence for decades, arming and training the mujahedeen (in effect building the precursor of Al Qaeda) in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets; stoking the Iraq-Iran War in the 1980s; invading Iraq in 2003; trying to topple Assad since 2011; and waging relentless drone attacks in recent years.
The fact that jihadist terrorist attacks in the West are relatively new, occurring only in the last generation or so, indicates that they are a blowback – or at least an extension – of the Middle East wars.
With very few exceptions, the countries that have been attacked are those that have been engaged in the post-1990 Western-led military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria.
The terrorists themselves cast their actions in political terms, even though we rarely listen; indeed, the terrorists’ words are typically reported only briefly, if at all.
But the fact is that almost every terrorist attack in the West or against Western embassies and personnel has been accompanied by the message that it is in retaliation for Western meddling in the Middle East.
The Paris terrorists pointed to France’s operations in Syria.
To be clear, Western actions do not provide Islamist terrorism with a scintilla of justification.
The reason to point out these actions is to make clear what Islamist terrorism in the West represents to the terrorists: Middle East violence on an expanded front.
The West has done much to create that front, arming favored actors, launching proxy wars, and taking the lives of civilians in unconscionable numbers.
Ending the terror of radical Islam will require ending the West’s wars for control in the Middle East.
Fortunately, the Age of Oil is gradually coming to an end.
We should make that end come faster: climate safety will require that we leave most fossil-fuel resources in the ground.
Nor do the other ancient motives for Western interference apply any longer.
The UK no longer needs to protect its trade routes to colonial India, and the US no longer needs a ring of military bases to contain the Soviet Union.
It is time for the West to allow the Arab world to govern itself and to choose its path without Western military interference.
And there are heartening reasons to believe that a self-governing Arab Middle East would wisely choose to become a peaceful global crossroads and a partner in science, culture, and development.
The Arab world has played that beneficent role in the past, and it can do so again.
The region is filled with talented people, and the overwhelming majority in the region want to get on with their lives in peace, educate and raise their children in health and safety, and participate in global society.
Their objectives – prosperity and human security – are our own.

Can Asia Free Itself from the IMF?
BERKELEY – There has never been a question about the ultimate purpose of the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), the system of Asian financial supports created in 2000 in that Thai city.
That purpose, of course, is to create an Asian Monetary Fund, i.e., a regional alternative to the International Monetary Fund, whose tender ministrations during the 1997-98 financial crisis have not been forgotten or forgiven.
So far, however, the CMI has been all horse and no saddle. Its credits and swaps have never been activated.
The distress following the failure of Lehman Brothers would have been an obvious occasion.
Yet, revealingly, the Bank of Korea, the central bank hit hardest, negotiated a $30 billion foreign-currency swap with the United States Federal Reserve, not with its ASEAN+3 partners.
Now, we are told, ASEAN+3 has achieved another great breakthrough, the so-called Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM), aimed at turning its bilateral swaps and credits into a regional reserve pool.
The goal was set in 2005, and last month ASEAN+3 finance ministers negotiated the details.
They specified contributions to their $120 billion pool, set down borrowing entitlements, and allocated voting shares.
The agreement on contributions is significant, it is said, because China and Japan will both contribute 32%.
In previous regional agreements, like capital subscriptions to the Asian Development Bank, China had always been treated as a second-rate power and asked to contribute less.
Indeed, China had shunned Japan’s 1997 proposal to create an Asian Monetary Fund precisely because it worried that it would play second fiddle.
That China is now acknowledged as a co-equal means that it will not stand in the way of further cooperation.
Also significant, we are told, is the agreement to make decisions by simple majority, with countries’ votes to be roughly in proportion to their contributions.
This means that no single country can block action, in contrast to the IMF executive board, which makes decisions by consensus, giving large countries like the United States de facto veto power.
But do these new rules really matter?
Disbursing more than 20% of the credits available to a country still requires that it first reach an agreement with the IMF, and 20% of a country’s entitlement is actually less than it contributes to the pool.
This would appear to nullify the very purpose of the arrangement, which is to free Asia from the IMF.
While there is a plan to raise and then eliminate the 20% threshold, this is left to some future, unspecified date.
The reason for the contradiction is straightforward.
Countries putting money on the barrelhead want assurances that their resources will not be used frivolously, and they want to know that they will be repaid.
But regional neighbors find it hard to criticize one another’s policies and demand course corrections.
Political sensitivities run especially high in Asia.
Even in Europe, with its long history of cooperation, surveillance and conditionality are outsourced to the IMF.
Revealingly, the Fund, not the European Union, has taken the lead in negotiating emergency assistance packages for Hungary and Latvia.
Delinking the CMIM from the IMF will require Asian countries to undertake hard-hitting reviews of one another’s policies and to demand difficult policy adjustments.
Here ASEAN+3 talks the talk.
Its May agreement included a commitment to establish a regional surveillance unit.
But there is no agreement on where to situate it or how to staff it. It could be placed within ASEAN’s Secretariat in Jakarta.
It could be placed inside the Asian Development Bank in Manila. It could be given to the “neutral” Northeast Asian country, Korea.
The outcome matters – which is why governments are fighting over it. Recall how the fateful decision to situate the IMF in Washington, DC enhanced the influence of the US Treasury just down the street.
These dilemmas can be finessed by giving both surveillance responsibilities and the actual power to disburse funds to an independent board insulated from national politics.
Its members, with statutory independence and long terms in office, could function like the monetary policy committee of a central bank.
They could issue a Financial Stability Report that bluntly flags weak policies and financial vulnerabilities. And they could demand policy adjustments as a condition for disbursing funds.
The IMF could then be shown the door.
This scheme wouldn’t solve all of Asia’s problems. But it would at least head off one danger, namely the urge to accumulate even more reserves.
Recent volatility reinforces this temptation.
If Asian countries succumb, global imbalances and all their associated problems will return.
Pooling regional reserves as a way of making them go further is a better alternative.
But making this vision a reality requires further bold thinking.

What Now for America?
NEW YORK – At least it wasn’t a disaster.
If the Democrats had failed to secure a majority in the US House of Representatives, President Donald Trump would have felt almighty, with all the dire consequences that would entail.
But the Republicans still control the Senate, and that means that the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, will be pushed further to the right.
And the election of Republican governors in major states like Ohio and Florida means that electoral districts can be finessed to boost Trump’s reelection chances in 2020.
One of the most common political clichés ahead of these midterm elections was that they were a “battle for America’s soul.”
It is easy to imagine Republicans and Democrats standing for two different versions of the country: one is overwhelmingly white, modestly educated, not very young, strong in rural areas, often male, and proud to own guns; the other is better educated, younger, urban, racially diverse, more female, and keen to control guns.
These are caricatures, but they express a very recognizable reality.
Though both sides believe they are patriotic Americans, their idea of patriotism could not be more different.
The writer James Baldwin put the case for “progressive” patriotism well: he loved America more than any country in the world, and for that reason insisted on the right to criticize her perpetually.
Trumpian patriots would have denounced Baldwin as a traitor.
The big temptation for the Democrats, now that they have won control of the House, is to make the most of what they see as their greatest strengths: racial and gender diversity, and a shared loathing of Trump.
This would be a logical position.
Trump is indeed dreadful, and the Democrats could legitimately claim that older, rural white men are less representative of America today than the young, the urban, the nonwhite, and newly empowered women.
And yet, to focus the Democratic agenda on Trump and diversity would be a mistake.
There will be pressure, especially from younger Democrats, fired up by their success, to impeach the president.
But as long as the Senate, which would have to convict him, is in Republican hands, an indictment by the House would be practically meaningless.
Even if impeached, he would still be president, and Republicans would be inclined to defend him even more fiercely.
It is certainly a good thing to have more women and nonwhite, non-Christian representatives in the legislature.
This provides a refreshing and necessary contrast to the Republican Party, which has remade itself in the image of its leader: angry, white, and often openly racist.
But to fight Trump’s identity politics with an equally aggressive form of identity politics would make political tribalism worse, and could make it harder for the Democrats to win national elections.
There is always a danger that the Democrats will be divided, with younger radicals pitting themselves against the mostly white establishment.
But the Republicans, who seem utterly united behind their leader, have a problem, too.
The socially liberal, highly educated Republicans who used to be the backbone of the party have been pushed so far to the margins that they are almost invisible.
John McCain was perhaps the last of those Mohicans.
The Democrats should capitalize on that.
And the way to do it would be to put less stress on sexual, racial, or gender identity, and more on the economy.
This might seem a naive strategy during an economic boom, when Republicans can boast of record-low unemployment.
But even many traditional laissez-faire conservatives should recognize that a yawning divide between rich and poor is not good for business.
Henry Ford, who was not a fount of wisdom on many matters, recognized that if you want to sell cars, you have to put enough money into people’s pockets so that they can buy them.
This, too, is an issue close to America’s conflicted soul.
For some, American identity is based on red-blooded capitalist enterprise and rugged individualism, unhindered by excessive government regulation in the pursuit of material happiness.
But for others, America stands on an ideal of greater social justice and economic equality – which nowadays should include a commitment to address climate change (a barely-discussed issue in the midterms), given that global warming will harm the poor more than the rich.
There have been boom times for the very wealthy, such as the Gilded Age in the late nineteenth century, when 2% of American households owned more than a third of the country’s wealth, or indeed our own time, when the top 1% owns almost half the wealth.
And there have been periods of reform, when governments tried to redress the balance.
The most famous example is Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s.
It is clearly time for New Deal II.
Instead of promising more tax breaks for the richest citizens, a more equitable fiscal policy could pay for necessary bridges and other public goods and services that would improve everyone’s life.
Affordable health care for all citizens is a mark of a civilized society.
The US is still a long way from that goal.
The same is true of high-quality public education.
It is grotesque that so many people who stand to benefit from such “socialist” policies are still persuaded to vote against them because they are supposedly “un-American.”
Concentrating on egalitarianism would appeal to liberals, of course, but it should not alienate moderate voters either, because more equality would be good for the economy.
And it might even persuade some angry, poor Trump supporters to recognize that his pseudo-populism is not about helping the left-behind folks in Rust Belt cities and rural hinterlands. It is about giving even more money to the very few.
The Democrats’ core message for the next two years should be that in a plutocracy, everyone else loses.

The Arctic Comes in from the Cold
STOCKHOLM – Whether we are heading for a future of cooperation or of increasing confrontation in the Arctic remains to be seen.
But it is already clear that the region will command far more attention than it has in the past.
The main reason is of course climate change, which is accelerating the rate of ice melt and causing arctic temperatures to rise twice as fast as the global average.
Owing to their pace and scale, these changes have obvious geographic, economic, and strategic implications.
As the vast ice sheet that spans the region has melted, new fossil-fuel reserves and shipping routes have opened up, including the Northern Sea Route (NSR) along Russia’s Siberian coast and the Northwest Passage through Canada’s northern archipelago.
However, the same trend has also fueled the loss of permafrost, threatening billions of dollars’ worth of infrastructure that may soon be standing in mud instead of on firm ground.
Moreover, indigenous communities that have lived in the Arctic for millennia are increasingly voicing concerns about the growing threat to their livelihoods.
Nearly half of the Arctic’s land area is in Russia, as are around 70% of the four million people who live in the region.
Most live in the Kola Peninsula area near Norway and Finland, which is also home to Russia’s Northern Fleet and most of its sea-based nuclear deterrent.
But other parts of the region are no less important, strategically and demographically. Approximately two-thirds of the inhabitants of Canada’s arctic areas are indigenous people, as are the vast majority of the 56,000 people living on Greenland (which itself is the size of a small continent).
This summer, a century-old sailing ship, the Sedov, traversed the NSR without seeing any ice at all.
Such journeys still are possible only during the warmest months, whereas transit throughout the rest of the year requires special ships, often escorted by powerful icebreakers.
Nonetheless, the sea traffic has been steadily increasing, driven so far by the large energy projects that Russia is developing in Siberia.
Chinese and French companies each have a 20% stake in liquid natural gas extraction from the Russian-controlled Yamal gas fields, and South Korean-built tankers are shipping this LNG to Europe – and soon will be supplying East Asia.
Needless to say, many more projects are in the works.
Since 1996, the eight arctic countries – Russia, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark (Greenland), Iceland, Canada, and the United States – have cooperated through the Arctic Council, mostly to address environmental issues.
But now that the Arctic is becoming an increasingly important global theater, other countries are taking an interest.
In 2013, China, India, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan were granted observer status within the Council, in recognition of their scientific research commitments and interest in future shipping opportunities.
The potential for trade could be massive: the arctic sea route from Yokohama, Japan, to Hamburg, Germany, is 40% shorter than the current one that runs through the Suez Canal.
Perhaps inevitably, the new climate of great-power competition has increasingly affected Arctic issues.
At the Council’s ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland, last year, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shocked everyone when he refused to agree to a final communiqué and work program that mentioned climate change.
The Trump administration instead used the occasion to attack China for its own designs on the region.
In May next year, Iceland will pass the Council’s biennial rotating chairmanship to Russia, which is not likely to squander its two years in the driver’s seat.
Over the past decade, the Kremlin has devoted significant resources to strengthening its Arctic positions, reviving defunct Soviet military facilities and building new ones.
This military build-up has set off alarms within NATO, even though a sober analysis would find that in most cases, such facilities pose no particular threat to anyone – except, perhaps, polar bears.
Still, other points of contention do matter.
Russia regulates all of the shipping through the NSR, and thus will enjoy outsize control for as long as other parts of the Arctic remain covered with ice.
But as more ice melts, new shipping channels will open up well north of Russia’s jurisdiction, and this will introduce a slew of new legal issues.
In light of these looming issues, a recurrence of the type of confrontation that derailed the Rovaniemi summit would be most unfortunate.
With the executive meeting of the Arctic Council taking place in Reykjavik next month, we will soon know what the future holds.
There are more than enough issues for the US, Russia, China, and others to clash over nowadays.
But all should recognize a shared interest in preserving and further developing an open, collaborative framework for the world’s northernmost region.
One way or another, the Arctic will become an increasingly important theater.
It behooves us all to make it one of mutually beneficial cooperation, not war.

Climate Change, Markets, and Marxism
LONDON – Brazil’s new foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, is on record as believing that climate change is a plot launched by “cultural Marxists” to stifle Western economies.
These nefarious forces’ environmentalist “dogma has been used to justify increasing the regulatory power of states over the economy.”
Given the key role that Brazil has played in past climate-change debates, including in forging the 2015 Paris climate agreement, President-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s choice of Araújo must disturb anyone who believes that climate change threatens severe harm to human welfare.
Coming on top of US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement, his appointment threatens progress toward a low-carbon economy.
Part of the response to such conspiracy theorists must be to keep making the scientific case that climate change is occurring and will cause major harm to middle-income countries such as Brazil (even more than to developed economies).
But it is also important to convince people that combating climate change threatens neither prosperity nor private enterprise.
True, the need to tackle climate change does pose a challenge to simplistic and extreme free-market ideology.
Free markets alone cannot cope with the “externalities” that arise when economic activities produce harmful consequences that impose no direct cost on individual producers and consumers.
And climate change is the biggest externality of all, with the harmful consequences likely to be suffered by future generations worldwide, rather than primarily by those currently producing and consuming fossil fuels.
As a result, significant public policy interventions are required.
These should include carbon prices, which create incentives for reducing emissions; regulations mandating more energy-efficient buildings, consumer appliances, and vehicles; and subsidies to nascent technologies that have not yet achieved the economies of scale required for low-cost production.
Given the need for such interventions, the belief that climate change is a hoax is comforting to anyone who thinks that government must play no role in the economy.
Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged, a paean to entrepreneurship unfettered by environmental or social constraints, is a favorite of climate-change deniers.
But the public-policy interventions needed to fight climate change pose no threat to responsible private business or to the aspirations of developing economies.
A report just published by the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) – which includes many major businesses and no obvious “cultural Marxists” – describes how to build a zero-carbon global economy at only minimal economic cost by 2060.
In fact, such an economy would deliver as many job and business opportunities as those created by today’s fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
This is true for developing countries in particular.
For example, India will need to triple its annual per capita energy consumption – currently about 30 gigajoules – to achieve the standard of living of today’s developed world.
But it can do so while cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and dramatically cutting the terrible air pollution that blights its major cities.
Nobody should be trying to keep any economy down, and nobody needs to.
The ETC’s analysis shows that India could increase its total electricity supply from today’s 1,100 TW hours to 2,500 by the 2030s, with continued rapid growth thereafter, while never building any more coal-fired power stations beyond those already under construction, and without suffering a growth penalty.
More broadly, a zero-carbon global economy in 2060 would probably consume 4-5 times as much electricity as today’s 20,000 TW hours, delivering improved transport services, air conditioning, and cleaner heating to billions of people.
This will create huge opportunities for investment, job creation, and income growth.
Initial subsidies were required to drive the dramatic cost reductions now benefiting wind and solar power.
But it is mainly private companies that are now producing wind turbines and solar panels, and it is private investors, submitting competitive bids in power auctions, who are financing renewable power and earning good returns, despite ever-falling prices.
Venture capitalists – a group not known for its Marxist leanings – are playing a major role in the development of new battery technologies and electric vehicles.
Market competition is not only compatible with a zero-carbon economy.
It is essential.
Carbon prices and appropriate regulation can provide the required incentives, but competition among profit-motivated firms is crucial to ensuring that decarbonization is achieved at the lowest possible cost.
The market’s capacity for “price discovery,” lauded by free-market thinker Friedrich Hayek and largely ignored by Karl Marx, will be crucial.
Vibrant capitalist economies have always depended on a carefully calibrated balance between government policy and private competition.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s significantly extended the previously minimal role of the US federal government.
But, rather than holding back growth and destroying private enterprise, it was followed by 30 years of spectacular capitalist development, spreading prosperity as never before and dramatically expanding the ranks of the American middle class.
Ayn Rand’s free-market utopia, so beloved by climate-change deniers, is as detached from real-world complexities, and as likely to produce social and environmental disaster, as simplistic Marxist faith in the inevitable efficiency and incorruptibility of the state.
On the far right, free-market ideologues deny climate change because it threatens their facile economic ideology.
And there probably are some on the far left who, as Araújo fears, would like to turn the fight against climate change into a new justification for eliminating private enterprise.
Both sides deny reality, and for that reason are certain to be severely disappointed.

No Appeasement for North Korea
WASHINGTON, DC – Earlier this month, North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test – its second this year.
Judging by the tremor detected, it was the North’s most powerful nuclear device ever.
The question now is how the international community should respond.
That question has become all the more acute because, though North Korean reports are not exactly reliable, the propaganda that accompanied the latest test hinted that the North was testing a weapon design, not just an explosive device.
And, as South Korean officials have suggested, it may not be the last test of this year.
In other words, North Korea may begin to stockpile weapons of mass destruction.
Not only have the North’s recent nuclear tests been more powerful than those of previous years; they have also been conducted alongside an equally robust series of tests of ballistic missiles, including submarine launches and multi-stage rocket launches, with much more powerful engines.
This means that North Korea may be close to perfecting a delivery system for whatever weapons it is developing.
No one can say for sure whether a deliverable weapon will come from North Korea in the next two years, four years, or later.
But there is little doubt that the North Koreans are not just seeking attention; they are seeking a powerful bomb and the means to use it.
As expected, the international community has unvaryingly condemned the tests.
But not everyone agrees on what else to do.
Some observers, including New York Times contributor Joel S. Wit and former intelligence officer Scott Ritter, declare that now would be an appropriate time to initiate talks with the North Koreans.
The logic behind such suggestions seems to come down to, “What have we got to lose?”
The answer is simple: plenty.
Such talks – “dialogue” as the Chinese often call it – would most likely bring with it a general acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear-weapons state.
Moreover, the North would be unlikely to engage in any such talks, much less impose a moratorium on weapons tests, unless some of their longstanding demands – such as the suspension of joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea – were met.
This Realpolitik approach, some seem to believe, will somehow diminish whatever power the North Koreans wield, essentially disarming them.
But the truth is that the North has done nothing to earn such appeasement.
And, in fact, if the international community were to make any such conciliatory gestures, the result would be a bolder North Korea.
But there is a good reason why the international community – and the United States, in particular – has refused to agree to North Korea’s terms, particularly the suspension of US-South Korea military exercises.
Joint military exercises are an essential part of any alliance.
If two countries agree to mutual defense, they need to ensure that their cooperation is practiced and perfected.
That is precisely why North Korea, which knows a thing or two about the need for tests and exercises, has made the issue a top propaganda priority.
Instead of giving into such demands, the US has long held that it will engage in talks with North Korea only if they are based on previous agreements, including the September 2005 joint statement, which obliged the North to abandon all nuclear programs.
This is a sensible position.
After all, launching new talks that ignored past obligations would cast doubt on the viability of any new accord.
To be sure, pursuant to a February 2007 agreement, North Korea did take concrete steps to disable its nuclear facilities, including demolition of the cooling tower at its main atomic reactor in the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center in June 2008.
Such measures were supposed to brake the country’s nuclear momentum, by ensuring that restarting the program would be costly – perhaps even prohibitively so.
But, by restarting its nuclear program without rebuilding the cooling tower, North Korea has avoided many of those costs.
Kim Jong-un’s regime – which has as little regard for the environment as it does for international rules and norms – simply called for the steaming water used to cool the reactor to be dumped into a nearby river.
Against this background, the argument for talks is weak.
After all, negotiations are simply a means to an end, and if that end is unclear or unlikely, it makes little sense to engage in them.
Instead, the international community should reject North Korea’s demands outright, ending the regime’s fantasy that the world will simply accept it as a nuclear-weapons state.
Fortunately, the international community’s response to North Korea’s nuclear ambitions generally aligns with this imperative.
What is needed is more cooperation with China on sanctions enforcement, as well as deep and quiet talks with the Chinese that aim to address any strategic mistrust over the eventual political arrangements on the Korean Peninsula.
The US should also continue to strengthen its security relations with Japan and South Korea, including by developing and deploying antiballistic missile systems.
Direct measures like those that were allegedly used to hamper Iran’s nuclear program should be explored and accelerated.
None of this is to say that engaging North Korea is not an option.
On the contrary, previous agreements should remain on the table.
The September 2005 deal addressed North Korea’s key national interests: it gained assurances of peace and diplomatic recognition, in exchange for the dismantling of its nuclear program.
If the Kim regime really wants an opportunity to join the international community, it has everything it needs, written, agreed, and ready to be implemented.
If, however, it wants to continue its march toward nuclearization, it should know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it will remain a pariah.
Its status as a nuclear-weapons state will never be accepted.

Africa Is Not Europe’s Gas Station
NAIROBI – Having been thrust to the front lines of a climate crisis we did not cause, Africans have long urged rich countries to wean themselves off fossil fuels and slash their greenhouse-gas emissions.
But, instead of heeding our calls, the rich have remained addicted to oil and gas – much of which, in Europe’s case, has come from Russia.
Now they are taking this insult a step further: in their drive to end their dependence on Russian energy, the world’s wealthiest economies are turning to Africa.
Over the past few months, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has been working tirelessly to secure new gas deals with Algeria, Angola, Egypt, and the Republic of the Congo.
The closing of every single deal – the terms of which remain opaque – was attended by the CEO of Eni, the largest fossil-fuel company active on the African continent.
In other words, Draghi, a public servant, has been using government resources to deliver overwhelmingly private gains to an Italian company.
Similarly, in May, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz started his first official trip to Africa in Senegal, where he announced plans to pursue energy projects “intensively.”
Talks on gas extraction and liquefied natural gas (LNG) production have already begun, with Scholz expressing willingness to offer technical investments in power-plant infrastructure in Senegal.
It is not only those seeking to import the continent’s fossil-fuel resources who believe that Africa should extract more of them.
Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and United Nations high commissioner for human rights, recently argued that Africa should be exploiting its vast natural-gas reserves.
Robinson believes this would be just: by boosting energy access and spurring development on the continent, natural-gas extraction would help the hundreds of millions of Africans whom the fossil-fuel system has so far failed.
But, ultimately, what she is advocating is not much different from Draghi and Scholz’s strategy: use European taxpayers’ money to help massive corporations expand gas exploration and exploitation on African lands.
Robinson envisions the gas (and profits) going to Africans, but it is far more likely to be sent to Europe.
As the Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate recently pointed out, fossil-fuel development is nothing new for Africa, and it has long failed to reduce energy poverty or bring prosperity.
In fact, African economies that depend on fossil-fuel exports suffer slower rates of economic growth – sometimes up to three times slower – than those with diversified economies.
In Mozambique, foreign companies, led by Eni and TotalEnergies, have invested nearly $30 billion in developing offshore natural-gas reserves and LNG capacity.
Yet 70% of people still live without access to electricity.
It is unacceptable, not to mention unjust, that Germany and Italy are pushing African countries to pour their limited financial reserves into developing a fossil-fuel extraction and export industry for European consumers, especially with European demand set to plummet in a matter of years, as investments in renewables come online.
Such investments are an integral part of the European Union’s plan for ending its dependence on Russian energy.
The EU now aims to increase renewables’ share of its energy mix to 40% – or even 45% – by 2030, and overall gas demand is expected to fall 30% by 2030.
Moreover, Germany and Italy both plan to reach net-zero emissions within the next 30 years.
The EU’s new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will further accelerate the transition, as it penalizes countries stuck on fossil fuels.
Oil and gas companies are well aware of the impact this shift will have on their bottom lines.
For them, the goal of expanding output in Africa amounts to a cynical effort to squeeze every drop of profit out of their declining industry while they still can.
The fact that they will leave African countries holding the stranded assets is just as immaterial to them as their contributions to climate change have been.
Robinson is right about one thing: Africans need access to energy to enjoy lives of dignity.
But that is no reason to invest in a system that has already failed – precisely the system from which Europe is trying to wean itself.
Instead, Africa must invest in distributed renewable-energy systems, which would bring true prosperity and security to our continent, rather than poisoning our food, polluting our rivers, and choking our lungs to profit remote shareholders.
African climate-justice champions are very clear that we want to avoid locking in planetary catastrophe as much as we want to deliver universal energy access.
Unfortunately, African leaders do not seem to share our commitment to either goal.
Rather than using their time with Western leaders to demand support for the renewable-energy transition, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi agreed to increase oil and gas production and exports to Europe.
Senegalese President Macky Sall appears eager to join them, establishing Senegal as a fossil-fuel supplier for Europe.
During centuries of colonial rule, when European leaders told Africa to jump, we asked, “How high?”
Now Germany and Italy are telling us to saddle ourselves with fossil-fuel infrastructure that will soon become a drag on our economies and propel us toward climate disaster.
We must respond with a firm no, and instead demand that countries like Germany and Italy, and leaders like Robinson, support us in the development and implementation of renewable-energy systems.

Beyond Revolutionary Disillusion
PRAGUE - All revolutions, in the end, turn from euphoria to disillusion.
In a revolutionary atmosphere of solidarity and self-sacrifice, people tend to think that when their victory is complete, paradise on Earth is inevitable.
Of course, paradise never comes, and – naturally - disappointment follows.
That seems to be the case in Ukraine today, as its people prepare to vote for a new parliament little more than a year after their successful Orange Revolution.
Post-revolutionary disillusion, especially after the revolutions against communism - and in Ukraine's case revolution against post-communism - is rooted in psychology.
New circumstances imposed new challenges for most people.
Formerly, the state decided everything, and many people, particularly in the middle and older generation, began to see freedom as a burden, because it entailed continuous decision-making.
I have sometimes compared this psychological ennui to my own post-prison situation: for years I yearned for freedom, but, when finally released, I had to make decisions all the time.
Confronted suddenly with many options every day, one starts to feel a headache, and sometimes unconsciously wants to return to prison.
This depression is probably inevitable.
But, on a societal scale, it is eventually overcome, as new generations grow up.
Indeed, 15 years after the disintegration of Soviet Union, a new catharsis seems underway, and Ukraine’s Orange Revolution was part of that.
As Ukraine so clearly shows, the process of self-liberation from communism was, by definition, associated with a gigantic privatization.
Naturally, members of the old establishment, with their inside knowledge and connections, gained much of the privatized property.
This "inevitable" process poisoned political life and the media, which led to a strange state of limited freedom and a mafia-like environment.
The shadings differed from country to country in the post-communist world, but the new generations rising in these societies now seem to be fed up with it.
Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, as well as Georgia’s Rose Revolution, seems to confirm this.
While revolutions in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s were directed against totalitarian communist regimes, nowadays they aim to get rid of this mafia-type post-communism.
But to make the change irreversible, a truly independent and incorruptible judiciary is essential.
Too often in politically connected cases, suspicions and charges of wrongdoing are not pursued to an unambiguous conclusion.
This is understandable: the communist justice system was manipulated to serve the regime, and thousands of judges cannot be replaced overnight.
Although it is clear that a return to the old Soviet Union is not possible, some blame Russian influence for the disillusion in Ukraine.
Yes, there are some alarming elements in Russian policy, mostly because Russia has never really known where it begins and where it ends.
It either owned or dominated many other nations, and now it is only with grudging reluctance dealing with the loss of them all.
Some of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statements seem to recall the Soviet era with nostalgia.
Indeed, he recently called the disintegration of the Soviet Union a tragic mistake.
But Soviet nostalgia has far more to do with Russia’s traditional Great Power ambitions than with communism.
Russia, I believe, should clearly say – and the international community should clearly say to Russia – that it has defined borders that will not be questioned, because disputed borders lie at the core of most conflicts and wars.
On the other hand, I don’t want to demonize Putin.
He may lower oil prices for someone close to him, like Belarus’ dictator Alexander Lukashenko, and insist on a market price for someone else, but that’s basically all he can do.
I don't envision any serious conflict beyond that.
The promise of Western integration is one reason that conflict seems impossible, for it is a question of geography as much as shared values and culture.
Ukraine belongs to a united European political entity; the values that Ukraine endorses and that are embedded in its history are European to the core.
The Czech experience shows that implementing all of the European Union’s norms so as to be ready to qualify for membership takes some time.
But in principle, Ukraine can succeed as well.
Much the same is true for Ukraine and NATO.
Partnerships based on shared rules, standards, and values are the heartbeat of modern security.
Moreover, NATO in a way defines the sphere of a civilization, which of course doesn’t mean that NATO’s community is better than any other.
But it’s a community that is good to belong to – provided that people want it and that it makes historical sense for them.
NATO membership carries obligations, because situations may arise – and we have already experienced them – when NATO follows a United Nations appeal and conducts an out-of-area military intervention where, for example, genocide is being committed.
In other words, NATO membership, like EU membership, comes at a price.
However, I think that the advantages far outweigh any possible disadvantages.
It is up to Ukrainians to decide this for themselves and thus to overcome post-revolutionary disillusion.

The Necessity of a Global Debt Standstill that Works
LONDON/NEW YORK/GENEVA – Faced with an unprecedented economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers in rich countries have adopted a “whatever it takes” approach to save their economies from meltdown.
But, confronted by an even worse crisis in the rest of the world, the same policymakers have echoed US President Herbert Hoover’s administration at the onset of the Great Depression, essentially saying that nothing more can be done.
The result is trillion-dollar rescue packages for the advanced economies and crumbs for everyone else.
The tragedy is not just that the economic costs of social distancing are likely to be higher in emerging markets. It is also that the enormous rescue efforts in rich countries make it much more difficult for poorer countries to combat the pandemic.
Countries with sufficient borrowing capacities, such as the United States, have been able to raise huge amounts at rock-bottom rates.
But those funds come from emerging-market investors seeking safety and from US investors liquidating their foreign holdings.
In other words, some of the financing that the United States and other advanced economies rely on comes from emerging economies with much more pressing financial needs.
It is no surprise, therefore, that more than 100 countries have now approached the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance.
But the funds available to the IMF are insufficient.
G20 governments therefore recently agreed to suspend repayments on bilateral official loans from 76 of the world’s poorest countries until the end of 2020.
But a key constituency missing from the G20 plan is private creditors, which, for middle-income countries such as Mexico, account for the majority of sovereign debt.
Without private-sector participation, any official debt relief for middle-income countries may simply be used to service their private-sector debt.
It would be pointless for the official sector to lighten poorer countries’ debt burdens if this results only in a transfer to commercial creditors.
All private creditors need to participate on an equal basis in any standstill on debt service, both as a matter of fundamental fairness and to ensure adequate funding for emerging economies.
And their participation cannot be purely voluntary. If it is, relief provided by participating private creditors will simply subsidize the non-participants.
Moreover, history suggests that a significant percentage of private creditors may decline to participate, particularly when their own balance sheets are being squeezed by the effects of the pandemic.
In order for emerging and developing economies to be able to withstand the shock of COVID-19, it is imperative that the standstill include all private creditors.
We propose that a multilateral institution such as the World Bank create a central credit facility for each country requesting temporary debt relief, allowing them to deposit their stayed interest payments for use as emergency funding to fight the pandemic.
Principal amortizations occurring during that period also would be deferred, so that all debt payments would be postponed.
The multilateral institution overseeing the moratorium would monitor each country’s facility to ensure that the payments that otherwise would have gone to creditors were used only for emergency funding to combat COVID-19.
Once the global pandemic is over, all funding from this emergency facility would be repaid by the country.
In many countries, domestic law incorporates doctrines that allow the performance of a contract to be suspended because of wholly unforeseen, unpredictable, and unavoidable events.
For its part, public international law recognizes, in a doctrine called “necessity,” that states may sometimes need to respond to such exceptional circumstances, even at the cost of interrupting normal performance of their contractual or treaty undertakings.
COVID-19 meets all of these criteria.
Countries badly afflicted by this pandemic will need to deploy all their available financial resources to combat it.
And they must obtain those funds from several sources – by diverting expenditure earmarked for other purposes, securing loans or grants from official institutions, and redirecting money that had been intended for scheduled debt service.
Countries that make these adjustments will not be acting in a discretionary or optional manner; rather, they will be acting out of necessity in the truest sense of the word.
Everyone, and particularly the G20 countries, should publicly acknowledge this fact in the context of recommending a temporary standstill on bilateral and commercial debt payments.
Some may worry that a moratorium will destroy the sovereign-debt market.
But such concerns should be assuaged by the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime event, which is why it is being accompanied by the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, a stricter global lockdown than during World War II, and unprecedented monetary and fiscal policies in all advanced economies.
The pandemic has even caused the first-ever peacetime postponement of the Summer Olympic Games, which had been scheduled to take place in Tokyo in July and August.
If the International Olympic Committee and Japan were able to postpone the 2020 Games, then the G20 can surely organize a repayment standstill on private sovereign debt to keep the global economy alive until better times come.

Democracy on the Nile?
The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections may be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab World.
Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years.
Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years and say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot.
This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90% of the vote, albeit amid indifferent turnout.
Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot.
Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process.
Egypt could not truly set out on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution – to downsize the Pharaonic powers of its president and set limits on his term in office.
Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president. So the announcement that he wants competitive presidential elections is an important first step.
The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage, but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered.
The democratic genie is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region that is now embarking on the road of democracy.
Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way.
The real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections in Iraq, Palestine, and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria’s occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of its former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, show no signs of abating.
Egyptian opposition groups, too, have staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last few weeks.
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader Ayman Nour at the end of January.
The government’s heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown “Kifaya” (Enough) movement, which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime.
Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be holding up.
An alliance of local, regional, and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as-usual on the banks of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.
Only a month ago, Mubarak dismissed demands for constitutional reform as “futile.”
But, whatever combination of events brought about his change of heart, election initiative should be welcomed.
It is a necessary – but insufficient – first step for overhauling Egypt’s stagnant political system.
Egyptians are already wary of token reforms à la Tunisia, where longstanding President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections, but then staged a sham contest with a few handpicked “opponents.”
In previous Tunisian presidential referenda, Bin Ali routinely received 99% of the vote; he now got 96%.
Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.
As a measure of sincerity, he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency, which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place.
Mubarak should also endorse a limit of no more than two successive five-year terms for any president.
Equally necessary are confidence-building measures, including open and equal access to the media, which are now state-controlled.
I have announced that I intend to contest this upcoming presidential election as a way of opening debate on these essential reforms.
But I would gladly go back to my life as a private citizen once guaranteed a free and open election this fall.
If seriously implemented, these steps will transform Mubarak’s legacy.
Along with events in Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine, it may well usher in an Arab spring of freedom, one long overdue.

The Stall-Speed Syndrome
NEW HAVEN – Relapse is the rule in the post-crisis global economy.
In the United States, Japan, and Europe, GDP growth faltered again in the first half of 2014.
These setbacks are hardly a coincidence.
Persistent sluggish growth throughout the developed world has left major economies unusually vulnerable to the inevitable bumps in the road.
Sure, there are excuses – there always are.
A contraction in the US economy in the first quarter of the year was dismissed as weather-related.
Japan’s plunge in the second quarter was blamed on a sales-tax hike.
Europe’s stagnant growth in the second quarter has been explained away as an aberration reflecting the confluence of weather effects and sanctions imposed on Russia.
As tempting as it may be to attribute these developments to idiosyncratic factors, the latest slowdown in developed countries is not so easily dismissed.
Lacking cyclical vigor in the aftermath of severe recessions, today’s economies are finding it especially difficult to shrug off the impact of shocks and break out of anemic growth trajectories.
Consider the US.
Though annual GDP growth is estimated to have rebounded to 4% in the second quarter of 2014, following the 2.1% first-quarter contraction, that still leaves average growth in the first half of the year at a measly 1%.
The problem is even worse in Japan, where consumers brought forward expenditures in anticipation of the sales-tax hike.
The 6.1% first-quarter growth surge to which this gave rise was more than offset by a 6.8% second-quarter contraction.
The net result in the first half of this year – an average decline of 0.3% – is broadly in line with the 0.2% contraction now estimated for the fourth quarter of 2013.
With the trajectory of real (inflation-adjusted) growth having moved into negative territory, on average, for three consecutive quarters, Japan may once again be reverting to recessionary form.
Europe’s fragile economy has similarly failed to recover strongly enough to ward off periodic growth setbacks.
During the acute phase of the euro crisis, recession was concentrated in peripheral economies such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain.
Now, however, the malaise has spread to the core economies of Germany and Italy, both of which contracted in the second quarter, and to France, which recorded zero growth.
As a result, annual growth in the 18-country eurozone slipped to just 0.4% in the first half of 2014.
This poor performance can only exacerbate the European Central Bank’s deflationary concerns.
Collectively, the annual growth rate in the major developed economies averaged a little less than 0.7% in the first half of 2014.
America’s paltry 1% growth led the way, while Japan and Europe, whose combined GDP is roughly equal to that of the US in purchasing-power-parity terms, recorded no better than a 0.3% increase.
On balance, that is easily 1-1.5 percentage points below the developed world’s longer-term, or potential, growth trend – a worrisome outcome, to say the least, for employment, deflation risk, global trade, and export-dependent developing economies, such as China, which remain heavily reliant on external demand in developed countries.
But there is another problem with persistently subpar growth: It provides no cushion to shield economies from unexpected blows.
That is especially true when growth falls below 1%, leaving a thin margin between expansion and contraction.
Such sluggish performance is the economic equivalent of “stall speed” – the heightened vulnerability that aircrafts can encounter at low velocity.
Under such circumstances, it does not take much to lead to an aborted takeoff, or worse.
The analogy is all too apt today.
Shocks, whether traceable to weather, geopolitical disturbances, strikes, or natural disasters, are the rule, not the exception.
When hit by them, vigorously growing economies have cushions to withstand the blows and the resilience to shrug them off.
Economies limping along near stall speed do not.
The odds of a recessionary relapse in an environment of unusually weak growth – very much the problem today – should not be minimized.
The big question is what should be done about it.
The current approach, centered on unconventional monetary policy, is not the answer.
Though monetary policy provided a powerful antidote to frozen credit markets in the depth of the global financial crisis, it has failed to spark classic cyclical recoveries.
That should be no surprise.
The world’s major developed economies are not suffering from cyclical deficiencies in aggregate demand that are amenable to a monetary cure.
As the Bank for International Settlements correctly points out, they are still struggling in the aftermath of wrenching balance-sheet recessions.
In the US, a lingering overhang of household debt implies that deleveraging and the rebuilding of savings continues to take precedence over discretionary consumption.
In Japan, long-standing structural problems, such as aging, labor-market rigidities, and a generalized productivity malaise, can be addressed only through the so-called “third arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s reform agenda, which remains woefully incomplete.
And Europe faces a desperate need to build pan-European institutions to ensure banking and fiscal union, and to address serious competitiveness problems in France and Italy.
Unfortunately, the more that central banks give the impression that that they are on the case, and the more that markets cheer them on, the less pressure there is on politically gridlocked governments to deploy fiscal policy and push through structural reforms.
Moreover, the fixation on monetary accommodation leaves slow-growth, balance-sheet-constrained economies stuck at stall speed, increasing the risk of yet another global growth relapse.
Myopic authorities need to take less guidance from frothy financial markets and focus more on the structural repair of a post-crisis world.
This is a time for heroes, not cheerleaders.

Arrested Diplomacy
CANBERRA – On November 19, Carlos Ghosn, the board chair and former CEO of Nissan, was arrested at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport on suspicion of under-reporting income and misusing corporate funds for personal purposes; he remains in custody.
Less than two weeks later, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of its founder, was arrested in transit at Vancouver’s airport on charges by the United States that Huawei had violated US sanctions against Iran; out on bail, she now awaits an extradition hearing.
These two cases are technically unrelated.
But both underscore an important truth: in a globalized world, domestic legal processes can have major international repercussions.
Ghosn’s arrest put Japan’s justice system on trial in the court of world opinion.
In fact, Japan lacks many of the elements of due process found in Anglo-American jurisprudence, such as the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.
As a leading Japanese criminal defense attorney, Makoto Endo, put it, Japan’s criminal justice system operates on the premise of “guilty until proven guilty.”
But it may be even worse than that: a 99% conviction rate (among those who are indicted) implies that Japan’s prosecutors and courts could be colluding, rather than working to achieve justice.
For example, prosecutors’ requests for extensions of custody (up to 23 days) are rarely rejected, and bail is seldom granted.
Many suspects who are released on bail are re-arrested repeatedly on fresh charges until a confession is secured.
The problems with Japan’s justice system have been on public display since Ghosn’s arrest.
On January 8, using a rarely invoked constitutional provision, Ghosn made his first court appearance, at which he rejected all accusations as “meritless and unsubstantiated.”
On the face of it, his ten-minute rebuttal seemed more plausible than the prosecution case against him. Yet he remains in jail.
The way Ghosn appeared in court – handcuffed, a rope around his waist, and wearing plastic slippers – exacerbated what was already becoming a global public-relations disaster for Japan.
And yet, on January 10, prosecutors filed two additional charges against him. He could now be stuck in jail for six months until the trial begins.
The silver lining is that Ghosn’s case could spur a much-needed overhaul of Japan’s legal system to balance better the interests of prosecutors and the rights of defendants.
But that can happen only if he is acquitted.
When it comes to Meng’s arrest, the international implications are more palpable: Canada has now become a battleground in the Sino-American trade-cum-technology war.
Indeed, US President Donald Trump himself politicized the case by declaring that he could intervene in the case if it would help to repair US relations with China.
In other words, he made Meng a bargaining chip in the escalating bilateral conflict.
As Jeffrey D. Sachs notes, the arrest of top executives for corporate malfeasance (as opposed to personal crimes like embezzlement) is rare in the US.
Huawei is China’s largest international tech company, and has emerged as a world leader in 5G technology.
Realizing that it is losing its competitive edge, the US is now scrambling to recapture it, using its global financial clout.
So, while Ghosn’s case exposed what Brad Adams, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, has called Japan’s “long overlooked ‘hostage justice’ system,” Meng’s arrest has been condemned by some as tantamount to “kidnapping” and “political hostage-taking.”
That is not surprising.
Imagine that China imposed unilateral sanctions on firms doing business in Taiwan, and then called for the arrest of their executives in third countries like Japan and South Korea.
Meng’s case raises three key questions.
Should international transit corridors at airports function as legal trapdoors for travelers?
Why has Canada given a US law precedence over Canadian, Chinese, and international law?
Why should China tolerate the unilateral arrest in Canada of one of its leading citizens, who had not violated any Canadian, Chinese, or international law?
China certainly is not taking Meng’s arrest lying down.
Like the US, China is not averse to wielding its diplomatic clout, military might, and financial muscle to protect its interests.
Already, the Chinese authorities have arrested two Canadians in retaliation, and earlier this month, Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was resentenced to death for a drug-trafficking conviction, after initially receiving a 15-year prison term.
Echoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s position on Meng’s arrest, China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying – who had criticized the Meng case as “an abuse of judicial procedures” – rejected Canada’s appeal for clemency for Schellenberg.
Out of respect for the rule of law, Hua said, China’s government would not interfere in the judicial proceedings.
China’s retaliation against Canadians is as unjustified as it is predictable.
After all, it is both less costly and less risky for China to take aim at Canada than at the US.
This does not, however, mean that China would not be willing to defy the US, especially if the US continues to pursue its emerging containment strategy.
China is not alone.
Non-Western countries have not backed Canada on the Meng issue, highlighting a broader clash of political cultures.
In fact, a growing number of non-democratic countries, including China, have lately been testing the standards of state behavior established, enforced, and arbitrated by the West.
The Canadian and Japanese governments have failed to manage effectively the reputational, economic, and geopolitical ramifications of the Meng and Ghosn cases, which, given the interconnectedness of today’s world, are unlikely to be the last of their kind.
To ensure that such cases do not escalate into potentially destabilizing international incidents, creative diplomacy – focused on finding an appropriate balance between legal values and geopolitical interests – will be vital.

Let Europe Lead in Ukraine
WASHINGTON, DC – As Russia’s annexation of Crimea proceeds, the United States must step back; the European Union must step forward; and the international community must ensure both that Russia pays a steep economic and political price for its actions, and that Russian and Ukrainian nationalists do not lock both sides into a deadly spiral of violence.
Thus far, Western leaders have played their cards about as well as they could, barring early missteps by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who described a calculated assertion of Russia’s regional interests as the behavior of a leader who was out of touch with reality.
Escalation of the crisis by the US at this stage would merely play into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hands and expose the West as a paper tiger.
To see why, it is useful to recall some history.
Throughout the twentieth century, the US intervened repeatedly in Latin America to topple or subvert governments it did not like: in Cuba, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Guatemala, Haiti, El Salvador, Chile, and Grenada, to name only the most prominent cases.
During the Cold War, successive US presidents were perfectly happy to send in troops, directly or indirectly, to ensure that friendly governments prevailed in the Americas (and beyond).
Now recall Western responses to previous Soviet and Russian incursions into strategically important countries: Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, or Georgia in 2008.
Each time, the US refused to engage militarily with a state possessing the largest number of nuclear weapons on earth.
To recite this history is not to approve it, but rather to try to understand how Russians might understand the legitimacy of Putin’s actions.
There is also the universal political dynamic whereby a foreign threat or crisis strengthens a leader domestically.
Putin is getting the same bump in popularity from his Crimean adventure that then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher got from the Falklands War in 1982.
Even left-wing intellectuals are lining up to support Putin for protecting ethnic Russians from what the Kremlin and its allied media portray as “fascist” Ukrainian nationalism.
Against this backdrop, US Secretary of State John Kerry is right to make clear that NATO is not contemplating a military response of any kind.
He would do even better to hand off responsibility as lead negotiator and spokesman in this crisis to a group of EU leaders: EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, Merkel, UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
The EU as a whole has far more extensive economic ties – and hence influence – with Russia than the US does.
The EU is Russia’s largest trading partner – the US is in fifth place, behind China and Ukraine.
Roughly half of Russian foreign direct investment in 2012 went to the Netherlands, Cyprus, and Switzerland (which is not an EU member, but is subject to EU pressure), while an estimated 75% of Russia’s inward FDI comes from EU countries.
Finally, Russian oligarchs own more property in London and the south of France than they do in New York or Miami.
Moreover, EU pressure on Russia is less likely to whip up Russian nationalism than US “interference” in Russia’s neighborhood.
For starters, Ukraine is in the EU’s neighborhood as well.
But, more important, the EU does not remind Russians daily of their post-Soviet losses and humiliation on the global stage in the same way that the US does.
The US has far fewer Russia experts in politics today than it did two decades ago, because most American foreign policymakers have been paying far more attention to China, India, and the Middle East.
No country, much less a former superpower, likes to be ignored.
Finally, if the US steps back, the EU, the United Nations, and even China can remind the Russians of the political consequences of flagrantly violating international law and swallowing up impoverished, restive territories that will prove far harder to digest than the fixed referendum results would suggest.
The Muslim Tatars – roughly 15% of Crimea’s population – strongly oppose joining the Russian Federation and may become a permanent thorn in its side, along with the 25% of Ukrainian-speaking Crimeans who have been silenced over the past ten days.
The US and European decision to impose some economic sanctions now, with the possibility of adopting tougher and broader sanctions later, is not a sign of weakness but of strategic calculation.
Heavier weapons remain in the diplomatic arsenal to deter Putin from trying to carve off further sections of Ukraine; in the meantime, markets are imposing additional economic costs on all Russians.
It is now equally important to strengthen the moderate members of the new Ukrainian government and to reduce the influence of right-wing nationalists who would trample on the rights of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.
From the French Revolution to Egypt and Syria, extremists have repeatedly overtaken moderates and then proceeded to mimic the tactics and politics of the government they originally united to overthrow.
That is not to say that the US, the EU, and other concerned actors should not do everything possible to ensure that Ukraine’s people, whatever language they speak and religion they practice, gain the rights and prosperity that they desperately seek.
For the US, the defense of universal values is, according to President Barack Obama’s National Security Strategy, a core American interest.
But the way to pursue that interest in this case is not to invite a Cold War-style face-off.
It is to backstop the countries that have the most influence over Russia and the most at stake – strategically and economically – in resolving this crisis.

Why the Greek Deal Will Work
LONDON – Now that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, does Greece’s near-death experience mark the end of the euro crisis?
The conventional answer is a clear no.
According to most economists and political commentators, the latest Greek bailout was little more than an analgesic.
It will dull the pain for a short period, but the euro’s deep-seated problems will metastasize, with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the European Union as a whole.
But the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong.
The deal between Greece and the European authorities is actually a good one for both sides.
Rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis, the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that, by correcting some of the euro’s worst design flaws, created the conditions for a European economic recovery.
To express guarded optimism about the Greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis or the pointless vindictiveness of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.
Neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like Joseph Stiglitz and conservatives like Hans-Werner Sinn.
The arguments against creating a European single currency and then allowing Greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s – and, in theory, they still are.
But this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable, or even tolerable.
Joining the euro was certainly ruinous for Greece, but there is always “a great deal of ruin in a nation,” as Adam Smith remarked 250 years ago, when losing the American colonies seemed to threaten Britain with financial devastation.
The great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage.
The United States in the mid-nineteenth century was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure, as evidenced by the Civil War, which was provoked as much by single-currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery.
Italy would probably be better off today if Garibaldi had never launched unification.
But once unification has happened, the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break-up.
This seems to be the case in Europe, as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries, including Germany and Greece.
Thus, the question was never whether the single currency would break up, but what political reversals, economic sacrifices, and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together.
The good news is that Europe now has some persuasive answers.
Indeed, Europe has overcome what could be described as the “original sin” of the single-currency project: the Maastricht Treaty’s prohibition of “monetary financing” of government deficits by the ECB and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another’s debt burdens.
In January, ECB President Mario Draghi effectively sidestepped both obstacles by launching a program of quantitative easing so enormous that it will finance the entire deficits of all eurozone governments (now including Greece) and mutualize a significant proportion of their outstanding bonds.
Moreover, European governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance.
Government debts never have to be repaid, provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money, issued by a credible central bank.
But for this to be possible, interest payments must always be made on time, and the sanctity of debt contracts must always take precedence over electoral promises regarding pensions, wages, and public spending.
Now that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government has been forced to acknowledge the unqualified priority of debt servicing, and can now benefit from unlimited monetary support from the ECB, Greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden, which is no heavier than Japan’s or Italy’s.
Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands.
Having achieved this, EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout.
Instead, they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “tough love” policies by easing austerity to accelerate economic growth, not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone.
This raises a key issue that the Tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the Greek crisis: the role of constructive hypocrisy in Europe’s political economy.
Gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems, but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the EU.
On paper, the Greek bailout will impose a fiscal tightening, thereby aggravating the country’s economic slump.
In practice, however, the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip, provided the government carries out its promises on privatization, labor markets, and pension reform.
These structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets, both in symbolic terms for the rest of Europe and for the Greek economy.
Moreover, the extension of ECB monetary support to Greece will transform financial conditions: interest rates will plummet, banks will recapitalize, and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010.
If budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors, which seems unlikely, this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy.
In short, the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in Greece.
Conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points; so the near-universal belief today that Greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair.

The Forgotten Virtues of Free Trade
LONDON – “Laissez-faire,” French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently declared, “is finished.” Perhaps, but should we really be satisfied if he is right?
If laissez-faire has run its course, what will possibly replace it as the foundation of an open, global society?
Now more than ever, it is worth remembering that the last great financial crash not only inspired the New Deal in the United States, but also plunged the world into a new dark age of economic nationalism and imperialism.
Free trade is far from perfect, but the alternatives are worse.
Protectionism is bad for wealth, bad for democracy, and bad for peace.
Yet a new wave of protectionism is a genuine danger.
Barack Obama, appealing to swelling protectionist sentiment among Americans, threatened during his presidential campaign to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement unilaterally.
This July, the World Trade Organization’s Doha trade round fell to pieces, partly because the US refused to lower its agricultural subsidies.
The world is on a slippery slope toward nationalism and exclusion.
If a government can step in to bail out failing banks, why not to protect its failing businesses or farmers as well?
We need a new deal for trade.
There is now widespread talk of a “Bretton Woods II” that would restructure global finance, promote sustainability, and offer developing countries “aid for trade.”
But, to be effective, any new deal to promote trade must involve more than a new set of international institutions.
It requires democratic reform from the bottom up.
In fact, this requirement is rooted in history.
We have become so accustomed to thinking of free trade as a specialist matter for liberal economists and trade negotiators in dark suits that we forget how a century ago, free trade was a core belief for many democrats, radicals, women activists, and, indeed, organized labor.
Back then, Britain was in a position not unlike that of the US today: a superpower in relative decline, facing new competitors and a backlash against globalization.
In the late nineteenth century, all powers raised their trade barriers – except Britain.
Britain’s stance holds lessons for today.
Most economists stress the superiority of the free-trade model and point to the power of lobbies and interest groups to explain its unpopularity in practice.
As US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has argued, trade expansion inevitably creates some losers, whose protests distract attention from the benefits of globalization.
This is true, but it is only half the story, for it ignores how, at crucial moments in history, free trade has mustered the support of the many winners.
A century ago, during an earlier crisis of globalization, the demand for free trade in Britain inspired a genuine mass movement.
It was not just a cause dear to bankers, merchants, or the young John Maynard Keynes.
It mobilized millions of people.
For women, who remained disenfranchised, free trade was a kind of substitute citizenship: parliament safeguarded their interests as consumers by keeping the door open for cheap imports.
For many democrats, it was a force for peace and social justice, minimizing the power of special interests and teaching citizens about fairness and international understanding.
We should not romanticize this earlier era of free trade.
Poverty did not vanish.
Many British people believed in a “Free Trade Empire.”
Others fanned the flames of Anglo-German antagonism, caricaturing protectionist Germany as a barbarian society surviving on horse sausages and dog-meat; Lloyd George, the future prime minister, told audiences that he was more afraid of the German sausage than he was of the German navy.
One reason that free trade defeated protectionism in Britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people’s emotions and identities, not just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food.
Liberals and radicals organized traveling shows, color posters, and political entertainment.
In towns, displays in shop windows illustrated the costs of tariffs to ordinary consumers.
In the countryside, people watched political slide shows late into the night.
Meetings in seaside resorts reached almost a million people in 1910.
When was the last time you went to the beach and found yourself pulled into a debate about tariffs?
The First World War and the 1920’s shattered any naïve belief in pure free trade.
Like today, consumers discovered that markets could leave them helpless, leading to calls for regulation.
Internationalists had to come to terms with the simple fact that, on its own, trade did not automatically enable peace.
Economic globalization had outpaced politics, creating new tensions over oil and other strategic resources.
Political institutions needed to catch up.
Bretton Woods and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade created a new order after the Second World War.
In economic terms, they have had considerable success.
Tariffs have fallen, although non-tariff barriers and preferential agreements have been on the rise.
But in terms of democratic culture, GATT also led to a further separation of trade from everyday politics.
This is why free trade has been left so defenseless in the face of anti-globalization protests.
The good news is that people have not stopped caring about the ethics of trade.
On the contrary, they have switched to other movements like fair trade and trade justice.
To be fair, the WTO under Pascal Lamy has tried to reach out to such groups.
Still, there is a long way to go to reconnect freer trade with citizenship and global solidarity.
History shows that doing so is both possible and necessary.

The Long March of “General” William Barr
NEW YORK – The death of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man, at the hands – or, more accurately, the knee – of a police officer in Minneapolis ignited massive protests across the United States against systemic racism and police brutality. It also spurred a growing number of people outside the US to confront the legacies of racism and inequality in their own countries.
Donald Trump’s administration, however, is doing no such thing.
Instead, the Trump administration has continued – even accelerated – its effort to hollow out America’s institutions in favor of a nihilistic populism.
Its ultimate goal remains unchanged: to create a full-fledged illiberal regime in the US.
No one is more committed to this dream than William Barr, Trump’s attorney general.
Barr may not have the foggiest idea who Antonio Gramsci was; Trump almost certainly doesn’t.
But Barr’s lust for power and Trump’s feral cunning seem to have led the two men to intuit the Italian Marxist philosopher’s theory of cultural hegemony: the idea that the ruling class gains society’s consent to the status quo by ensuring that a country’s institutions embody and promote a legitimating ideology.
Schools, courts, religious institutions, and the media, for example, can play a powerful role in in the internalization of norms, values, and beliefs.
Trump, Barr, and US Republicans more generally have used all of these institutions.
But, in response to the ongoing protests, the Trump administration has gone a step further, deploying law enforcement and even the military to advance their ideological ends.
On June 1, Barr – who, it is said, relishes the “general” in his job title – ordered the expansion of the protective perimeter that had been set up around the White House.
Officers fulfilled that mission – which involved clearing peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park, the site of many important protests in America’s history – using tear gas, smoke bombs, pepper spray, police batons, horses, and riot shields.
Trump then waddled across the emptied park in order to be photographed awkwardly holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Church.
Barr stood proudly nearby, alongside a real general, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who, after a tidal wave of criticism, subsequently expressed regret for having participated.
“My presence in that moment and in that environment,” Milley acknowledged, “created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.”
In fact, it was worse than that: the stunt called into question the US military’s 240-year-old tradition of remaining strictly apolitical.
Trump insists that his politicization of the military is a matter of upholding “law and order” – a phrase that harks back to Richard Nixon, another tough-talking US president with autocratic aspirations.
Though the demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, Trump claims that using force against protesters is actually an “act of compassion,” because it supposedly “saves lives.”
Antonio Gramsci, meet George Orwell.
Former senior US military leaders see through the Trump administration’s deceit and have condemned the Lafayette Square stunt.
General James Mattis, Trump’s own former secretary of defense, said this “abuse of executive authority” made “a mockery” of the US Constitution.
Over 1,000 former justice department officials published a letter requesting an internal review of Barr’s handling of the protests.
But both Barr and Trump are as committed as ever to their pursuit of illiberal cultural hegemony.
Trump has demonized protesters, including by touting the absurd conspiracy theory that a 75-year-old protester whom police were caught on camera shoving to the ground was an “Antifa provocateur.”
He also attempted to deploy 10,000 active-duty troops in the streets of Washington, DC, to “dominate” the demonstrators, whom he calls “thugs.”
Likewise, Barr has played up the violence, claiming – without any evidence – that “far-left extremist groups” are stoking it.
And he actually did deploy his own “army”: federal correctional officers – trained in quelling prison riots, not managing peaceful protests – who wore black clothes without badges or other insignia.
There is, however, a key difference between Trump and Barr.
The former is a reality-TV autocrat content to think that pretending to be strong makes him strong, even as he hides in a bunker and behind an impossibly high security fence.
(Having been born in Russia, I am all too familiar with a president who hides behind high walls that are supposed to symbolize power, but actually betray the state’s fear of civil society.)
Barr, by contrast, is a determined apparatchik.
While Trump asserts that his authority is “absolute,” Barr is dedicated to carrying out the “long march through the institutions” – in the words of Rudi Dutschke, the 1960s German radical leader who studied Gramsci’s work – required to make that claim true.
This has meant, for example, undermining Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and forcing federal prosecutors to drop their case against Trump’s first national security adviser, General Michael Flynn.
His latest assault on democracy is the dismissal of US Attorney Geoffrey Berman, a Manhattan-based federal prosecutor who has investigated several of Trump’s associates.
Barr has not corrupted his office and chipped away at executive accountability and transparency merely out of personal loyalty to Trump.
His motivations are ideological.
As a staunch proponent of the theory of a unitary executive, he wholeheartedly subscribes to the view that a president’s power is all-encompassing.
By this logic, Trump has the right to gut any investigation into his actions, and congressional oversight of the presidency should be severely curtailed.
Barr’s “chilling vision of unchecked presidential power,” as the journalist Damon Linker calls it, is akin to that of Carl Schmitt, the Nazis’ favorite legal philosopher.
General Barr is thus a true Gauleiter.
And, under Trump, he has been given the ultimate opportunity to implement his ideology, whatever the consequences for America’s constitutional order.
I suspect that even Gramsci would be stunned by how openly Barr has deployed the “apparatus of state coercive power” to enforce “discipline on those groups who do not ‘consent’” to Trump’s – and Barr’s – own hegemony.

COVID-19 Is Finishing Off the Sino-American Relationship
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Having already claimed nearly 217,000 lives and sent the global economy toward its deepest slump since the Great Depression, the COVID-19 crisis is bound to reshape geopolitics.
While the contours of the post-pandemic order remain to be seen, one thing seems certain: far from normalizing their relationship, the United States and China are likely to become increasingly estranged – and increasingly hostile.
Even before the current crisis erupted, the Sino-American relationship was on life support. The outbreak may have sounded its death knell.
In particular, evidence that local Chinese authorities initially suppressed information about the new coronavirus, together with the severe disruption of global supply chains caused by China’s sudden nationwide lockdown, highlighted for most Americans two sources of severe vulnerability stemming from the bilateral relationship.
The first is China’s repressive political system.
While Americans have long been aware of the ideological chasm between their country and China, to most it was largely an abstraction.
Stories about the forcible detainment of hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, the repression and abuse of Tibetans, and the persecution of political dissidents were harrowing, but distant.
For many, they were merely evidence of the US system’s superiority.
The COVID-19 outbreak – which has caused the deaths of more than 58,000 Americans, partial economic shutdowns, and mass unemployment – turned the abstract into reality.
For the first time, ordinary Americans going about their lives in their own country fear for their economic and physical survival, because of political repression in a distant land.
And Americans do, by and large, blame Chinese political repression for the crisis.
According to a recent Harris poll, more than 70% of Americans believe that China reported inaccurately on the outbreak’s effects, and over 75% hold the Chinese government responsible for the virus’ spread.
In fact, 55-60% believe that China’s government deserves more blame than its American counterpart for COVID-19’s spread in the US.
The second source of vulnerability lies in economic interdependence, especially US reliance on Chinese supply chains.
Before the outbreak, Americans viewed this issue mainly through the lens of trade imbalances and job losses. They now largely see China’s outsize role in producing the world’s personal protective equipment and pharmaceutical ingredients as a dangerous national-security weakness that must be mitigated.
But while the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted for Americans the true extent of the danger of engaging with China’s one-party regime, a large and immediate surge in mutual hostility was not inevitable. That outcome reflects both governments’ decision to leverage the crisis to boost their domestic standing.
After news of its botched initial response in Wuhan got out, the Communist Party of China (CPC) went into damage-control mode.
As soon as new infections began to decline, the government launched an aggressive diplomatic effort and propaganda blitz to repair its image.
It has sent medical supplies and personnel to hard-hit countries like Iran, Italy, and the Philippines.
At home, it has trumpeted its own resolute action, whipping up nationalism, and criticizing Western democracies’ weak responses.
The West, meanwhile, gave China plenty of ammunition.
US President Donald Trump, in particular, has overseen a truly inept crisis response, characterized by finger-pointing, constant contradictions, and outright lies.
With Trump’s failed response, and the associated meltdown of the US economy, now threatening his re-election prospects, the Republican Party is eager to pin the blame on China.
And many Americans seem convinced: according to the Harris poll, more than 50% agree with Trump’s characterization of the new coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus.”
This toxic brew of ideological hostility, a prolonged trade war, geopolitical rivalry, and domestic politicking will most likely fuel further escalation in bilateral tensions.
In the US, Congress is likely to pass legislation mandating the reshoring of China-based production of goods deemed relevant to national security.
And the Trump administration will probably impose new sanctions, including tighter restrictions on technology transfers.
Because such punitive measures enjoy wide public support – 71% of Americans want to pull manufacturing back from China – the only real question is how harsh they will be.
Given the political stakes, Trump is unlikely to show much restraint.
After all, the US relationship with China is set to be the most important foreign-policy issue in the November election.
Already, Trump has begun attacking his presumptive Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joseph Biden, for being “soft” on China, while Biden has responded by accusing Trump of being softer.
As for Chinese President Xi Jinping, he is unlikely to back down.
Earlier this month, at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee (the CPC’s top decision-making body), he declared that “we must maintain ‘bottom-line thinking’ and make mental and material preparations for changes in the external environment that will last a relatively long period of time.”
It is not yet clear exactly what Xi’s “bottom-line thinking” is, but it is a safe bet it implies that China will respond to intensifying US pressure not with concessions, but with retaliation.
At a time when the world is facing an imminent shared threat, a worsening cold war between its two largest economies is the last thing anyone needs.
But with neither leader likely to change his approach, this outcome will be hard to avoid.
In fact, far from catalyzing global cooperation, the pandemic may well lock the US and China into a vicious cycle of escalation, leading directly to full-blown conflict.

The Organ Crisis
LONDON – Organ transplantation is one of the most impressive achievements of modern medicine.
It has brought hope to millions of patients suffering from previously fatal organ failure.
For many, it has made life longer and better.
It has benefited many professionals and industries, too, by becoming a new source of pride, funding, and profit.
Struggling to contain costs, health-care payers are also among its beneficiaries.
Kidney transplantation, for example, has proved to be less costly than dialysis.
Yet, since its inception, transplant medicine has been grappling with a rapidly increasing gap between the supply of organs and demand for them.
For most stakeholders, the often dire consequences gave rise to a whole set of solutions, all based on one general strategy: if we are short of organs, then let us get more of them.
This strategy has come with a high price tag, however.
On the one hand, it has given rise to some exceptionally corrupt practices, such as organ trafficking, transplant tourism, and many other ugly phenomena associated with a black market in organs.
On the other hand, it has put transplant ethics under severe strain.
Indeed, transplant ethics has been on a slippery slope almost since transplants began.
The strategy of getting more organs has pushed, and continues to push, the ethical line to places that had previously been deemed immoral.
To tackle insufficient supply from the dead, we first embraced an increasingly inclusive, and at any rate flexible, definition of death.
This has often raised suspicions about the motivations of doctors in pronouncing a candidate donor’s death.
We then came up with the idea of opt-out consent for deceased organ donation.
This system, which allows organs to be harvested also from refusers who have failed to express their refusal, has not increased trust in medicine, either.
As the organ crisis continued to deepen, we allowed donations from the living.
This was particularly audacious, for it required us to abandon the supreme Hippocratic principle according to which it is unprofessional to injure a healthy person.
In the category of living donations, we first permitted only directed donations by relatives and non-directed donations by non-relatives.
We assumed that family ties and non-directedness would preclude coercion and commerce.
However, the mechanisms we used to confirm that assumption were conveniently lax.
They did not allow certain forms of coercion to interfere with the donor’s consent.
Nor were they overly fastidious about clandestine commercial ties.
By that time, we had already become aware that interests in organ commerce were constantly intensifying, and that those in need of organs or money were increasingly likely to turn to the black market or seek a legal loophole that would allow them to conceal the commercial transaction behind some legitimate gesture.
Until recently, we have not done much about the black market (the 2008 Declaration of Istanbul marks the beginning of a determined struggle against this market), but we banned altruistic directed donations by living non-relatives out of fear that they would become that legal loophole.
This fear did not last long, though.
The increasing demand for more organs has driven us to legitimize this category as well.
Indeed, it has helped a lot, but it has not sufficed, either.
Currently, we peddle the idea of quasi-non-commercial incentives for organ donations from both the deceased and the living.
For example, the new Israeli transplant law provides incentives for people to sign a donor card by giving them and their relatives priority on transplant waiting lists.
This material incentive is in clear breach of the principle that organs should be distributed according to need only.
Moreover, it is likely to discriminate against people who are either unaware of the donor-card system or tend to refuse to sign the card for reasons associated with religious beliefs or low trust in the medical authorities.
The same law indeed forbids commerce in organs, but offers living donors reimbursement of expenses that contains fixed-sum elements.
Moreover, the Israeli National Transplant and Organ Donation Center now openly encourages providers, insurance companies, and the Donor Card Institution, to pay families who consent to donate the organs of their deceased relative.
Such arrangements, which should be described as government-sponsored commercialism, are considered unacceptable by all relevant international declarations.
If things continue as they have, we will soon become tired of quick-fix remedies.
Indeed, advocates of the increasingly popular idea of a regulated market in organs claim that it is the ultimate treatment.
Perhaps it is.
But let us not even go there!
For even if we believe that buyers and sellers of organs can in principle enter the transaction on the basis of free choice, none of them has chosen to face the underlying dilemma in the first place.
Both are victims: the buyer is a victim of morbidity and declining social solidarity, while the seller is a victim of poverty and other forms of financial distress.
A regulated market would not challenge these man-made facts.
Instead, it would reaffirm them more than any previous ethical solution has ever done.
Many of the social crises that we currently face are just symptoms.
Yet the underlying problems must be addressed as well if we are to lead the kind of life that human beings can and deserve to have.
The organ crisis is no different.
Instead of medicalizing and ethicalizing it, let us direct our main efforts at draining the swamp.
Organ transplantation, like mosquito repellent, should be used sparingly, and only when there is no other choice.

Europe Crosses the Rubicon
The so-called “European Neighborhood Policy” has, so far, been a curious thing.
There is much talk about it in the European Union, but little practical effect.
It was meant as an alternative to the ever-increasing number of accession rounds, say, involving the countries in the southern Caucasus.
But the war in Lebanon and its consequences have caused a sudden and fundamental change in the leisurely pursuit of this policy.
The Lebanon War has served as a harsh reminder to the European Union that it has “strategic interests” – security interests first and foremost – and that, should it choose to ignore them, the price will be high.
Moreover, the division of labor between the US and Europe isn’t functioning in the time-tested manner of old: the ongoing war in Iraq is gnawing at America’s military capabilities and resulted in a crisis of moral and political legitimacy of the US across the Arabic/Islamic world.
With the decision of its member states to send several thousand soldiers to Lebanon to implement the UN cease-fire resolution 1701, the European Union has taken the most significant decision yet within its Neighborhood Policy.
Can the EU in fact be able to emerge as a stabilizing political force in the most dangerous area of conflict within Europe’s immediate geopolitical neighborhood?
After the Balkan Wars of the 1990’s, the Near and Middle East is at once the most dangerous and also – given security considerations – the most important neighboring region for the EU today.
Why?
Because the main threats to European security at the beginning of the 21st century stem from that region.
The threats concentrated in the Middle East are diverse: regional conflicts, totalitarian religious ideologies, terrorism, nuclear armament programs, blockades to modernization, unstable regimes and hegemonic ambitions.
If one asks what interests the EU and its member states have in this crisis-riddled region, the answer is, that certainly European energy and economic interests are at stake, as well as the vital interests of Europe’s partners and allies (Israel in particular).
But first and foremost on the list are Europe’s.
How the Middle East develops will determine the extent of the risks for, or even probable challenges to, Europe’s security.
Success in containing, or indeed resolving, the conflict there will have overwhelmingly positive consequences for Europe’s security.
The Middle East today is defined by three central conflicts: the Israeli-Arab conflict, Iraq, and Iran.
The fusion of Iran’s nuclear program (and Iran’s hegemonic ambitions) with the situation in Iraq and with Hezbollah in Lebanon will lead to a “New Middle East” which, in all likelihood, will provoke a major confrontation.
This will involve far more than just the usual regional actors and conflicts.
The war in Lebanon has made it abundantly clear how far this dangerous process has already progressed.
The mission in Lebanon is a high-risk one for the UN force, and for Europe in particular.
The war did not bring forth a real decision.
Neither Hezbollah nor Syria, let alone Iran, have any interest in the UN mission’s success.
The Security Council resolution presupposes – in addition to separating the combatants – the enforcement of the internal and external sovereignty of Lebanon’s elected government of Lebanon, without saying how this is to be accomplished with a politically strengthened Hezbollah, militarily superior to the Lebanese forces.
Any attempt at disarming Hezbollah by the UN force would mean a war with Hezbollah (and with Syria and Iran in the background) -- a task the UN force cannot accomplish.
But were it to resign itself to mere observer status in Lebanon, the UN and Europe would lose all credibility.
Moreover, it is likely that, within a few months, UN soldiers would once again find themselves between the firing lines of the conflicting parties.
The mission therefore will have to walk the thin and risky line in pursuit of its robust mandate to stabilize the country.
Failure will be a constant danger and the military risk will be high.
Yet, in light of the situation there is no better alternative.
In view of the risk to its troops, Europe will be compelled to influence and even proactively bring about strategic changes to the political environment in the entire Middle East.
With its decision in favor of the mission in Lebanon, the EU crossed a military Rubicon.
It must now back up its growing weight in the Middle East with political initiative.
This must include three key elements: a negotiated solution for Syria; a resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians; and a common strategic understanding with the US of the political strategy of the West for the region (which addresses the region’s most dangerous conflict, Iran).
This common understanding will be the pivotal challenge for the future of the transatlantic relationship.
For Europe and its troops, the stakes in Lebanon are very high.
But this is about vital European interests.
War and chaos in the Middle East or just a moral or political vacuum will directly affect and upset the security of the EU and all its member states.
Europe therefore had to act, though that decision was obviously difficult.
The key question in the near future will be whether Europe actually has the military and political capabilities, the political staying power, and the common will to act in accordance with its core interests in the Middle East.
We will see.
In any case, one thing can already be said: Welcome to the real world.

The Post-Inflation Economy That Could Be
CHICAGO – Economic commentaries nowadays are typically about inflation or recession, so let’s instead consider the growth prospects once central banks get those challenges under control.
As matters stand, there appear to be worrisome headwinds to growth.
As most advanced-economy populations age, their labor-force growth is slowing, so there will need to be greater productivity per worker to compensate.
But with investment in physical capital muted, labor productivity is unlikely to grow rapidly without significant innovation, either in work processes or products.
While it initially appeared that increased telecommuting during the pandemic would enhance productivity (by saving time and avoiding the duplication of capital at home and in the office), many firms are rediscovering the value of having workers in the office at least for some of the time.
Another headwind comes from poorer countries, where lower-middle-class households have suffered tremendously through the pandemic and now from food- and fuel-price inflation.
Many children have missed more than two years of school and are likely to drop out, permanently impairing their earning potential and the skill-base of the labor force more broadly.
Meanwhile, deglobalization – through reshoring, near-shoring, and friend-shoring – threatens to make it even more difficult for them to get good jobs.
In the longer run, the weakness of demand in these countries will spill over to the developed world.
If the world does not find new sources of growth, it will fall back into the pre-pandemic malaise of secular stagnation.
But this time, the situation could be worse, because most countries will have limited fiscal capacity to stimulate the economy, and because interest rates will not fall back quickly to their pre-pandemic lows.
Fortunately, there are tailwinds that could be unleashed.
While trade in goods seems to have reached its limits before the pandemic, trade in services still has not.
If countries can agree to remove various unnecessary barriers, new communications technologies would allow many services to be offered at a distance.
If a consultant working from home in Chicago can cater to a client in Austin, Texas, so can a consultant from Bangkok, Thailand.
Yes, consultants in other countries might need to have front offices in the United States to assure quality or redress complaints.
But the overall volume of work that could be undertaken by global consulting companies would grow substantially, and at a significantly lower cost, if their services could be offered across borders.
Similarly, telemedicine has become increasingly feasible not just in psychotherapy and radiology but also in routine medical diagnoses (sometimes aided by local equipment or a nurse practitioner).
Again, global organizations (for example, a global Cleveland Clinic) could help reduce informational and reputational barriers, allowing for a general practitioner in India to conduct routine medical exams for patients in Detroit – referring them out to specialists in Detroit when needed.
The biggest barriers to such trade in services are not technological but artificial.
Understandably, the authorities in advanced economies do not allow general practitioners in India to offer medical services without proper certification.
But the problem is that most countries’ certification procedures are unnecessarily cumbersome.
What if the world could agree on a common certification process for the work done by general practitioners?
A country with unusual ailments could tack on an addendum to the exam for those who want to practice there, but only if absolutely necessary.
A second problem is that national health-insurance schemes typically do not pay for services from outside the country.
But if the certification challenge has been met, there is no good reason why they shouldn’t, given the cost savings that would result.
A third barrier is data and privacy.
No patient will be willing to share personal details or test results if she cannot be sure that the data will be kept confidential and safe from misuse.
In an era of geopolitical tension and economic blackmail, meeting those conditions requires not just a commitment from the service provider but also assurances from the provider’s government that it will not violate patient privacy.
Democracies that can enact strong privacy laws (including limits on how much data their own government can see) will be better positioned to capitalize on this trade than autocracies, where there are few checks on government.
Imagine how much faster and more affordable it would be for a US citizen to reach a doctor if routine matters were outsourced.
Developed countries would obviously benefit, but so would developing economies, because the incomes that their doctors generate would be used to employ more workers locally.
Moreover, these doctors would be less likely to emigrate, and they could use the same telemedicine technologies to provide services in remote parts of their own countries.
At the same time, specialists in advanced economies would be able to offer more of their services to patients in developing countries without them having to travel to New York or London, as they currently do.
But aren’t service providers in rich countries likely to resist removing barriers that, together with the difficulty of competing at a distance, have ensured them high wages?
Probably, but there will still be significant domestic demand for their non-routine services.
Also, if barriers are lowered elsewhere, they will be able to serve much larger markets with specialized high value-added services.
For this reason, an agreement on reducing barriers to trade in services among a broad set of countries will have a greater chance of success than bilateral agreements.
Moreover, many others in advanced economies, including manufacturing workers who have borne the brunt of global competition, will benefit from cheaper basic services.
As economic inequality both within and across countries decreases, global demand should also strengthen.
Another potential tailwind for growth lies in “green” investments.
Though Russia’s war in Ukraine has complicated the clean-energy transition for Europe, much of the world’s emissions-heavy capital still needs to be replaced, and those investments could help jump-start the global economy.
To aid the transition, each country will need to establish sensible incentives for businesses and consumers, such as investment credits, emission regulations, cap-and-trade systems, or carbon taxes.
Governments also will need to agree on a system for allocating responsibility to high-emitting countries (which are typically rich and less vulnerable to climate change), so that they can help finance the energy transition in low-emitting countries (which are typically poorer and more vulnerable).
The post-pandemic, post-inflation economic outlook is not all doom and gloom.
But much work needs to be done to dismantle artificial barriers and leverage existing technologies.

Orphan Ideas
CHICAGO – Since the United States Supreme Court’s “Citizens United” decision, which prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by corporations and unions, concern about business interests’ influence over US elections has been growing.
But political contributions are only one reason why business interests have so much power.
When it comes to lobbying, money is not everything: ideas play a big role, too.
Unfortunately, rather than leveling the playing field, the battle of ideas may skew US politics even further in favor of big business.
The importance of ideas can be seen from the simplest things.
Congressional bills aimed at benefiting powerful constituencies are generally given appealing (and misleading) names.
For example, a tax holiday to repatriate foreign earnings was called the “American Job Creation Act.”
It is easier to sell a bill that (allegedly) benefits everyone in society, not just a small group of its most privileged members.
More importantly, the lobbying of the quasi-governmental mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not have been so successful without the idea of the “ownership society.”
How could anyone oppose turning every American into an owner?
It is precisely the appeal of such ideas that can make them so dangerous politically.
If ideas are like weapons in lobbying, it is important to appreciate the possible distortions in the market for their creation and diffusion.
New ideas are like new drugs.
While some pharmacologists dedicate their lives to searching for the cure for cancer, regardless of any monetary incentives, many are driven by the hope of securing a lucrative patent.
Even if researchers themselves are motivated by only the noblest of goals, their need for funding forces them to take into account profitability.
That is why we have so-called “orphan drugs,” from which not enough money can be made because they cure rare diseases or diseases (like malaria) that affect people who cannot afford to pay for them.
The process of creating new economic ideas (or new evidence about old ideas) is not that different.
Researchers do not get patents, but they get citations, recognition, and promotions.
While some researchers dedicate their lives to the search for truth, regardless of any personal gain, many are driven by the hope of academic stardom and the money that comes with it.
Even if researchers themselves are motivated by only the noblest of goals, their need for funding forces them to take into account the demand for ideas.
And, if funding is not a major issue, the mechanism of amplification of an idea (and thus its ultimate diffusion) nonetheless depends upon how appealing it is to some lobbying effort.
Consider a great researcher in my field, Michael Jensen.
In 1990, he co-wrote a paper about executive pay, arguing that it was not sufficiently linked to performance.
Although the authors used an untenable benchmark to determine that the sensitivity of pay to performance was too low, the article was published in a top economic journal, prominently discussed in the Harvard Business Review, and is one of the most cited papers in economics.
Fifteen years later, Jensen wrote a paper about the costs of excessive sensitivity of pay to performance.
The paper was published in a minor journal and is not very well cited.
Why?
Business loved the first paper, because it shifted the conversation from how much executives were paid (a very controversial topic) to how they should be paid (a more technical and less contentious issue).
And, since companies cannot make executives pay out of their pockets for bad performance, the shift in focus ended up justifying an increase in pay.
There was no similar love for the second paper, which languishes almost unknown, despite its important insights.
Jensen, a researcher of the highest integrity and fame, is free to write on both sides of this issue.
But the two papers’ asymmetric citation payoff is a warning for young scholars: if they want to get ahead professionally, the position that they should take is clear.
From venture capital to telecommunications, from the construction industry to teachers’ unions, there is plenty of demand for evidence that celebrates the benefits of these industries and justifies (implicitly or explicitly) government subsidies to them.
There is no equally organized and active demand for evidence that all of these subsidies are distortionary, waste money, and make companies less rather than more competitive.
Here is perhaps the biggest orphan idea: pro-market does not necessarily mean pro-business.
A pro-business agenda aims at maximizing the profits of existing firms; a pro-market agenda, by contrast, seeks to encourage the best business conditions for everyone.
Who benefits from evidence that an industry is too concentrated, its profit margins are too high, and consumers are being ripped off?
As with malaria drugs, millions of people would benefit from such an idea, but their ability to pay is limited.
And, sure enough, in most of what we economists write – and, more important, in what we teach in business schools – it is hard to tell the difference between being pro-market and being pro-business.
The battle against crony capitalism starts in the classroom, and we professors are inevitably implicated.
If we are not part of the solution, we are part of the problem.

Palestine Stands Up
JERUSALEM – Although the crisis over Israel’s naval interventions to defend its blockade of Gaza is gaining all the headlines around the world, something of far more historic importance is taking place in the Middle East.
The Palestine National Authority is preparing to issue a unilateral declaration of independence, and it is taking concrete steps on the ground to make any such declaration viable.
When US President Barack Obama appointed former Senator George Mitchell as his special envoy for Middle East peace negotiations, Mitchell’s mandate was to achieve within two years not only an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but also overall peace between the Jewish state and the whole Arab world.
But, after 15 months on the job, and innumerable visits to the region, all Mitchell has to show for his efforts is an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority to start indirect “proximity talks” – which it is hoped will lead to direct talks in due course.
When one bears in mind that both sides have been negotiating directly for 15 years, Mitchell’s achievement appears even more minuscule.
Under such circumstances, calling Mitchell’s work up to now a failure is the only polite – and realistic – thing to do.
It is as easy to blame Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s intransigence – his enforcement of the Gaza blockade, for example – as it is to point out that the Palestinian Authority does not control Hamas-ruled Gaza, with its 1.2 million inhabitants, leaving it in no position to speak authoritatively for Palestinians.
As a result, one thing that both Israelis and Palestinians agree on is that the proximity talks will most likely lead nowhere, so both sides are currently busy ensuring that the other side will be blamed for the failure.
On too many issues – borders, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem – the gaps between the two sides are too deep to be easily bridged.
In these circumstances, an idea recently raised – tentatively but courageously – by Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad should be eagerly welcomed.
It may or may not fly, but it is arrestingly novel: if negotiations fail – so Fayyad says – sometime in 2011 the Palestinians should declare independence unilaterally.
This may be a real game changer.
Obviously, it would not resolve the conflict; it might not even immediately change the situation on the ground. Indeed, it could even precipitate some unforeseen Israeli countermeasures.
But it would certainly mean a paradigm shift for a conflict in which everyone has been treading water for almost two decades.
If the Palestinians declared independence unilaterally, and if, as is expected, some sort of recognition by at least some states followed, the contours of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would change dramatically.
Indeed, the conflict would become, if one can use the expression, more “normal” – no longer between an occupying power and an occupied people, but between two countries, two states, that disagree about a lot of issues, including borders, mutual relations, and control over populations.
In a way, a unilateral declaration of independence would make the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a bit more like the Israeli-Syrian conflict – an inter-state conflict. It might even force Israel to make decisions that until now it found easier to avoid.
Such a declaration would also be an enormous act of self-empowerment for the Palestinians.
Until now, they have failed abysmally in institutional nation-building, a necessary requirement for any successful national movement.
Palestinian nationalism is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of most Palestinians – yet, since 1948, when the United Nations proposed partitioning British Palestine into two states, a Jewish and an Arab one, it has failed to move from ideology towards reality.
Neither violence nor terrorism nor relying on outside powers (the UN, the Arab League, the Soviet Union, the US, the European Union) succeeded in delivering statehood, which a people can achieve only by its own agency – what Zionist ideology calls “auto-emancipation.”
Fayyad is the first Palestinian leader who did not emerge from the Fatah movement, and he may thus understand what other Palestinian leaders failed to comprehend, mired as they were in a toxic combination of self-righteous ideology and violence.
It may just be that the Palestinians are on the verge of a new chapter in their history – and in the history of Israel and the whole region as well.

Trump’s Train Wreck
WASHINGTON, DC – Donald Trump, the US Republican Party’s presidential nominee, has again shaken up his campaign organization.
In doing so, he is revealing more about himself and his so-called management style than he may want people to see.
Few presidential campaigns have featured such evident chaos and churn in personnel.
Two people who have never run a presidential campaign, and whose political instincts contradict each other’s, are now running Trump’s operation.
Kellyanne Conway, his new campaign manager, is a pollster who has been mining survey data from the mainstream Republican right for years (the party’s right wing is its “mainstream,” because its center is essentially gone).
During the Republican primary, she worked for the “super PAC” that backed Trump’s bitter rival, Ted Cruz.
Conway is a smart, tough partisan who is expected to be a steady and sensible influence in the campaign.
If she prevails – and Trump can stick to a theme – we’ll see a more reasonable Republican candidate.
On the other hand, Trump’s decision to appoint Steven Bannon as his campaign CEO foretells anything but steadiness and sensibility.
Prior to his appointment, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a far-right, hyper-nationalist – indeed white supremacist – online publication.
He is known to be a combative nihilist who will stoop to any depth to win.
Bannon’s appointment caused mainstream Republican jaws to drop.
Trump, trailing Hillary Clinton badly in August polls, has come under growing pressure to move closer to the Republican Party establishment.
Unless he adopts a more mainstream approach, he will not be able to attract white suburbanites – a key constituency still up for grabs.
But Bannon is no fan of the Republican establishment.
Under Bannon, Breitbart News routinely assailed Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
Earlier this summer, it attacked Ryan for supporting an omnibus spending bill that funds President Barack Obama’s Syrian refugee program, and for sending his children to a private Catholic school.
It even backed Ryan’s Wisconsin congressional primary opponent, a Trump supporter whom Ryan defeated in an 84-16% landslide.
Breitbart News also condemned the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, publishing a column that accused McConnell of being soft on Clinton to remain in the good graces of donors who oppose Trump.
What has the Conway-Bannon dichotomy produced?
Early signs suggest that Conway is sanding down some of Trump’s rougher edges.
For example, Trump, who never apologizes, recently expressed vague “regret” for offending people.
More important, Trump has been moving away from his tough anti-immigration stance, such as his pledge to establish a special “deportation force” to round up all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.
What Trump is moving toward, however, remains unclear, as is whether his supporters will let him get away with this shift.
By contrast, Bannon apparently wants to “let Trump be Trump.”
He seems to support Trump’s refusal to “pivot” from the divisive rhetoric of the primary season to a more “presidential” approach.
Presumably, he hopes to free Trump to follow his basest instincts, spewing vile invective against Clinton as the election contest heats up.
That won’t go down well with the constituency that Conway is trying to win over to Trump.
There is little reason to think Trump’s new staffing arrangement will yield a new, more coherent candidate.
Throughout the campaign, he has vacillated wildly between poise and pugilism, sometimes in the same day.
Trump’s appointment of Bannon, in particular, suggests that he is desperate, scared, and lost.
Although it still isn’t clear how much Trump actually wants to be president, we know that he hates to lose.
And yet he doesn’t seem to understand the basics of presidential politics, nor the difference between the primary season and the main event.
He still boasts that he defeated all of his Republican opponents, though, given how the primary process works, it’s easier to beat 16 rivals than one or two.
Trump also confuses the enthusiastic supporters who attend his rallies with the presidential electorate.
He seems not to comprehend that what he says to his ardent fans is heard by a much larger, and less sympathetic, public.
This is a key reason why his poll ratings were plummeting by mid-August.
And so he did what flailing candidates often do: he shook up the staff.
Bannon replaced Paul Manafort, who was close to the elites Bannon despises, and who had tried to strengthen Trump’s ties to them.
Manafort made the major misstep of trying to compel Trump to change, and of telling mainstream Republicans that he could manage the candidate.
Even politicians without Trump’s outsize ego would bridle at such talk.
By the time Manafort was replaced, Trump was ignoring his advice, and Manafort had essentially given up.
In the meantime, Manafort’s past as an adviser to and lobbyist for unsavory dictators around the world was catching up with him.
In one instance, he had worked for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a proxy for Russian President Vladimir Putin who fled to Russia after being driven from power in 2014.
The US Justice Department has now started to scrutinize Manafort’s lobbying activities in the US on behalf of Yanukovych, which posed yet another threat to the campaign.
While Trump’s influential children had initially favored Manafort, that changed when he started to attract the wrong kind of media attention, including questions about Trump’s so-far inexplicable affinity for Putin.
Manafort may be gone from the Trump campaign, but his Ukrainian ties will be a matter of press interest for some time to come.
The 2016 presidential election isn’t over, so it’s still possible that Trump could end up in the White House.
His poor judgment in people, glaringly apparent in recent weeks, is yet another reason why that is a dangerous possibility for American democracy.

Today, the United Nations estimates that 77 million people – more than 1% of the world’s population – are displaced within their own countries, having been forced to flee their homes by armed conflicts, violence, urbanization, development, and natural disasters.
This is more than the population of France, the United Kingdom, or Turkey.
These people are not “refugees,” because they have not crossed an international border, but their experiences are often equally devastating.
Today, the number of people who have been internally displaced by conflicts alone is twice that of refugees.
With the increasing pattern of internal, rather than international, armed conflicts, and the rising regularity of extreme weather events affecting millions of people, internal displacement poses an even greater challenge to future generations.
Uprooted from their homes and livelihoods, and traumatized by the violence or sudden disaster that forced them to flee, the displaced are often thrust into an extremely precarious future with few resources.
Think of the 15 million Chinese displaced following the Sichuan earthquake, the more than two million Iraqis uprooted within their country’s borders by sectarian and other violence, the 2.4 million displaced in Darfur, or the hundreds of thousands who have fled Mogadishu in the last year.
In the last decade, those displaced by conflicts alone rose from 19 million to 26 million, with millions more displaced by disasters.
The plight of these victims long went unrecognized, as governments and the international community alike failed to acknowledge their rights to protection and assistance.
In 1998, the UN issued Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which sets out these legal rights.
Ten years on, what impact have the Principles had on displaced people’s lives?
The achievements are notable, if insufficient.
We have raised awareness of the plight of the displaced, brought about changes in government policies, and raised billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs.
This has helped save countless lives.
Humanitarian efforts continue to be strengthened, including through a new rapid funding mechanism, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund.
But for every gain we have made, enormous difficulties still remain.
The number of those displaced by natural disasters is rising, as the adverse effects of climate change continue to mount.
Nine of every ten recorded disasters are now climate-related.
As many as 50 million people around the world are estimated to be displaced each year by floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and landslides.
However sudden the initial displacement, the impact can last for generations, together with a long-term need for clean water, shelter, health care, and other basic services, as victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998 know from bitter experience.
Nor are rich countries immune.
Two years after Hurricane Katrina, thousands of people remain in temporary shelters.
Moreover, violent armed groups, be they government-supported militias or rebel movements, increasingly embrace terror as a tactic to force civilians from their homes, as seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Iraq, and elsewhere.
Millions of people remain impoverished, face discrimination, and suffer long-lasting trauma even after the guns fall silent.
Life in camps is demoralizing and ultimately dehumanizing.
The world rightly focuses on the tragedy in Darfur, but overlooks another four million Sudanese still displaced as a result of the north-south conflict, many of whom continue to live in terrible poverty in Khartoum slums or in makeshift camps across the country, with little opportunity to re-build their lives.
We must prevent displacement from occurring, and end it as quickly as possible.
On the preventive front, countless lives can be saved by simple actions such as flood-proofing coastlines, or strengthening earthquake codes for hospitals and schools.
Countries like Bangladesh and Mozambique have proven that disaster risk reduction and preparedness can be a life-saving investment.
In conflict situations, preventing displacement primarily requires political will.
Those who forcibly displace civilians in violation of international law must be held accountable in order to deter others in the future.
States that are not involved in the conflict are also required to uphold the rights of the displaced, including the right to return to their homes wherever possible, and this must be addressed in peace agreements and enforced in peacekeeping mandates.
So here’s the bottom line: conflicts will continue and natural disasters are growing in frequency and intensity.
Addressing the root causes and reducing the impact of displacement should start by heeding victims’ voices – their needs and wishes must be understood and their rights respected.
The international community can help. But national authorities must lead.
Ten years after the Guiding Principles were signed, the time for excuses and inaction has run out.

Debating the Confidence Fairy
LONDON – In 2011, the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman characterized conservative discourse on budget deficits in terms of “bond vigilantes” and the “confidence fairy.”
Unless governments cut their deficits, the bond vigilantes will put the screws to them by forcing up interest rates.
But if they do cut, the confidence fairy will reward them by stimulating private spending more than the cuts depress it.
Krugman thought the “bond vigilante” claim might be valid for a few countries, such as Greece, but argued that the “confidence fairy” was no less imaginary than the one that collects children’s teeth.
Cutting a deficit in a slump could never cause a recovery.
Political rhetoric can stop a good policy from being adopted, but it cannot stop it from succeeding.
Above all, it cannot make a bad policy work.
I recently debated this point with Krugman at a New York Review of Books event.
My argument was that adverse expectations could affect a policy’s results, not just the chances that it will be adopted.
For example, if people thought that government borrowing was simply deferred taxation, they might save more to meet their expected future tax bill.
On reflection, I think I was wrong.
The confidence factor affects government decision-making, but it does not affect the results of decisions.
Except in extreme cases, confidence cannot cause a bad policy to have good results, and a lack of it cannot cause a good policy to have bad results, any more than jumping out of a window in the mistaken belief that humans can fly can offset the effect of gravity.
The sequence of events in the Great Recession that began in 2008 bears this out.
At first, governments threw everything at it.
This prevented the Great Recession from becoming Great Depression II.
But, before the economy reached bottom, the stimulus was turned off, and austerity – accelerated liquidation of budget deficits, mainly by cuts in spending – became the order of the day.
Once winded political elites had recovered their breath, they began telling a story designed to preclude any further fiscal stimulus.
The slump had been created by fiscal extravagance, they insisted, and therefore could be cured only by fiscal austerity.
And not any old austerity: it was spending on the poor, not the rich, that had to be cut, because such spending was the real cause of the trouble.
Any Keynesian knows that cutting the deficit in a slump is bad policy.
A slump, after all, is defined by a deficiency in total spending.
To try to cure it by spending less is like trying to cure a sick person by bleeding.
So it was natural to ask economist/advocates of bleeding like Harvard’s Alberto Alesina and Kenneth Rogoff how they expected their cure to work.
Their answer was that the belief that it would work – the confidence fairy – would ensure its success.
More precisely, Alesina argued that while bleeding on its own would worsen the patient’s condition, its beneficial impact on expectations would more than offset its debilitating effects.
Buoyed by assurance of recovery, the half-dead patient would leap out of bed, start running, jumping, and eating normally, and would soon be restored to full vigor.
The bleeding school produced some flaky evidence to show that this had happened in a few instances.
Conservatives who wanted to cut public spending for ideological reasons found the bond vigilante/confidence fairy story to be ideally suited to their purpose.
Talking up previous fiscal extravagance made a bond-market attack on heavily indebted governments seem more plausible (and more likely); the confidence fairy promised to reward fiscal frugality by making the economy more productive.
With the help of professors like Alesina, conservative conviction could be turned into scientific prediction.
And when Alesina’s cure failed to produce rapid recovery, there was an obvious excuse: it had not been applied with enough vigor to be “credible.”
The cure, such as it was, finally came about, years behind schedule, not through fiscal bleeding, but by massive monetary stimulus.
When the groggy patient eventually staggered to its feet, the champions of fiscal bleeding triumphantly proclaimed that austerity had worked.
The moral of the tale is simple: Austerity in a slump does not work, for the reason that the medieval cure of bleeding a patient never worked: it enfeebles instead of strengthening.
Inserting the confidence fairy between the cause and effect of a policy does not change the logic of the policy; it simply obscures the logic for a time.
Recovery may come about despite fiscal austerity, but never because of it.
Although Krugman invented his discourse for an American readership, it perfectly fits the British case as well.
In his first budget in June 2010, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned that “you can see in Greece an example of a country that didn’t face up to its problems, and that’s a fate I am determined to avoid.”
In presenting the United Kingdom’s 2015 budget in March, Osborne claimed that austerity had made Britain “walk tall” again.
On May 7, that claim will be put to the test in the UK’s parliamentary election.
British voters, still wobbly from Osborne’s medicine, can be forgiven if they decide that they should have stayed in bed.

Europe’s Precarious New Normal
LONDON – A decade ago, ten countries joined the European Union.
Today, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are universally recognized as fully integrated European countries.
The extraordinary political transitions set in motion by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, together with the mundane and drawn-out EU accession process that followed, produced this new normal – one essentially free from the political and economic distortions of the Cold War.
Ukraine is now venturing down this path – without the promise of full accession.
On this anniversary, with an era of geopolitical tension again descending on the European continent, it is worth reminding ourselves what the new normal has meant for the countries that joined the EU ten years ago – and what it could mean for Ukraine.
Europe’s “missing middle,” gouged out by the Iron Curtain, has been restored.
Trade in the region has flourished, naturally gravitating toward the EU, the world’s largest market.
Investment has flowed in the opposite direction, from capital-rich to capital-poor countries, as economic theory would predict.
Comparing Poland and Ukraine underscores the difference that EU membership has made.
In 1989, Poland and Ukraine had approximately the same standard of living; today, Poles are three times richer.
Poland’s income gap with Western Europe today is smaller than it has been at any point since the year 1500.
Given that the EU’s combined GDP is eight times larger than that of Russia, we should expect a path toward normality for Ukraine to mean that the EU would dominate the country’s foreign trade.
But this does not imply a complete break with Russia, whose weight in Polish exports has tripled since 2004.
Given their geographic proximity and industrial networks, the potential for trade between Russia and Ukraine is much greater.
But the new normal is about democracy and dignity as well.
It is hard to imagine that what is currently happening to the social fabric in eastern Ukraine could happen in Poland.
EU accession has undoubtedly contributed to Poland’s exceptional institutional transformation.
Like Ukraine, Poland suffered from widespread corruption in the years immediately following the collapse of communism.
But today it ranks better than many old EU members on corruption indicators.
The painstaking approximation of EU rules and regulation that helped Poland become a normal European country by the late 1990’s would offer Ukraine the prospect of taming its own demons of bribery, cronyism, and nepotism.
Moreover, Poland has benefited from access to massive EU funding, with more than €92 billion ($128 billion) pouring into the economy over the last ten years.
Private-sector flows have been much larger throughout Central and Eastern Europe as well, owing to attractive conditions for foreign direct investment – much of it comprising long-term projects with associated benefits like knowledge transfer and the introduction of international best practices.
Establishing this kind of normality in Ukraine could unleash massive transformational forces.
But this aspiration, as we all know, is now in serious jeopardy.
And the price of its extinction could be high, not only for Ukraine, but also for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
For starters, with sanctions targeting Russia’s floundering economy, revived trade ties are becoming a source of vulnerability for these countries.
Already, companies active in the Russian market are reporting problems finding funding, and cross-border investments are being postponed.
The impact goes beyond short-term trade and investment.
Expensive quick fixes to increase energy security are crowding out other important priorities in Central and Eastern Europe, such as long-term investment in tertiary education and research, and much-needed improvements in dilapidated health-care systems.
And the post-1989 “peace dividend,” which has helped create fiscal space, is evaporating, as countries in the region and beyond perceive a need to increase defense expenditures.
As Europe’s leaders mull over their next steps and consider how to respond, Ukrainians should consider carefully how much they would gain by moving down the path of economic and institutional reform toward European normality.
At the same time, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe deserve the EU’s support in their efforts to reduce their vulnerabilities.

Facing Up to Chronic Disease
MONTREAL – Many of us are terrified by the prospect of having a debilitating stroke or a fatal heart attack.
Few of us, however, respond as emotionally to the threat of chronic disease, a vague and elastic term that is mainly useful for organizing health services.
And yet chronic disease has become a major social problem that requires a collective response.
Historically, chronic disease referred to conditions lasting over a long period.
But, with the increasing organization of medicine around specific diseases, the term has come to refer to an open-ended set of conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, but not infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, or mental illness.
In the nineteenth century, chronic disease was considered problematic in part because sufferers took up scarce beds in hospitals that were increasingly focused on treating acute, curable diseases.
But chronic disease soon became a wider public-health issue as the death toll from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes seemed to rise.
In fact, the initial increase in the number of reported deaths from these diseases most likely reflected better identification and diagnosis.
Filling in death certificates is not an exact science, and doctors focus on causes with which they are familiar.
Over time, though, the incidence of chronic disease almost certainly did rise in developed countries.
As infectious diseases have been brought increasingly under control, more people live into old age, when they become susceptible to long-term illnesses.
As a result, chronic diseases now comprise a large proportion of health-care systems' total caseloads.
Our collective interest in addressing the problem of chronic diseases does not rest only on epidemiological statistics.
It also reflects deep, long-standing concerns about the effects of civilization: urban overcrowding, sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy habits like tobacco and alcohol consumption, overeating, and stress.
Moreover, we have come to believe that most diseases, including previously hopeless conditions, can be prevented, cured, ameliorated, or controlled by scientific medicine, and that even those patients unlikely to benefit have a right to medical care.
As chronic disease has become an increasingly prevalent social problem, it has been dealt with in two ways.
The most common response is disease-specific.
The American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, as well as the disease-based research institutes of the National Institutes of Health, are notable examples.
An alternative approach is to treat these illnesses as a single, comprehensive problem.
The earliest example occurred in the United States, where a focus on welfare measures and health insurance for vulnerable populations – the elderly, the disabled, and the very poor – led to a strong push to confront the chronic diseases widespread among them.
European countries, preoccupied with national health-care systems that addressed the needs of the entire population, took longer to move toward comprehensive strategies.
Both approaches have given rise to new forms of epidemiological surveillance.
Since the 1950s, for example, the field has been extended to risk factors, a concept that grew out of debates about the health effects of tobacco and studies of cardiovascular diseases with multiple potential causes.
Some risk factors – moderate hypertension and high cholesterol, for example – have themselves become chronic diseases, requiring medical (and sometimes surgical) treatment and further contributing to the rise in illness rates.
A new vision of health care, which has grown out of the US managed-care movement, has recently heightened the relevance of embracing a comprehensive approach to treating these conditions.
Originally intended to cut costs, the goal now is to provide more appropriate care for a new era, the premise being that long-term care for many diseases requires forms of medical organization that are different from those geared toward acute care.
Acute episodes and expensive hospitalization can be avoided by providing expert team support for patient self-care.
The most successful and radical of these initiatives is the Chronic Care Model developed by Edward Wagner, an American doctor.
Less sweeping is the Medical Home Model, also developed in the US, which seeks to create teams of caregivers to provide better access and continuity of care to patients suffering from multiple diseases.
Massive health-care systems cannot shift course easily or quickly.
But efforts like these, by focusing on the need to provide appropriate and less expensive care for chronic diseases, constitute a small step in the right direction.

Can Macron Pull it Off?
CAMBRIDGE – Emmanuel Macron’s victory over Marine Le Pen was much-needed good news for anyone who favors open, liberal democratic societies over their nativist, xenophobic counterparts.
But the battle against right-wing populism is far from won.
Le Pen received more than a third of the second-round vote, even though only one party other than her own National Front – Nicolas Dupont-Aignan’s small Debout la France – gave her any backing.
And turnout was apparently sharply down from previous presidential elections, indicating a large number of disaffected voters.
If Macron fails during the next five years, Le Pen will be back with a vengeance, and nativist populists will gain strength in Europe and elsewhere.
As a candidate, Macron was helped in this age of anti-establishment politics by the fact that he stood outside traditional political parties.
As president, however, that same fact is a singular disadvantage.
His political movement, En Marche !, is only a year old.
He will have to build from scratch a legislative majority following the National Assembly elections next month.
Macron’s economic ideas resist easy characterization.
During the presidential campaign, he was frequently accused of lacking specifics.
To many on the left and the extreme right, he is a neoliberal, with little to distinguish himself from the mainstream policies of austerity that failed Europe and brought it to its current political impasse.
The French economist Thomas Piketty, who supported the socialist candidate Benoît Hamon, described Macron as representing “yesterday’s Europe.”
Many of Macron’s economic plans do indeed have a neoliberal flavor.
He has vowed to lower the corporate tax rate from 33.5% to 25%, cut 120,000 civil service jobs, keep the government deficit below the EU limit of 3% of GDP, and increase labor-market flexibility (a euphemism for making it easier for firms to fire workers).
But he has promised to maintain pension benefits, and his preferred social model appears to be Nordic-style flexicurity – a combination of high levels of economic security with market-based incentives.
None of these steps will do much – certainly not in the short run – to address the key challenge that will define Macron’s presidency: creating jobs.
As Martin Sandbu notes, employment was the French electorate’s top concern and should be the new administration’s top priority.
Since the eurozone crisis, French unemployment has remained high, at 10% – and close to 25% for people under 25 years old.
There is virtually no evidence that liberalizing labor markets will increase employment, unless the French economy receives a significant boost in aggregate demand as well.
This is where the other component of Macron’s economic program comes into play.
He has proposed a five-year, €50 billion ($54.4 billion) stimulus plan, which would include investments in infrastructure and green technologies, along with expanded training for the unemployed.
But, given that this is barely more than 2% of France’s annual GDP, the stimulus plan on its own may not do too much to lift overall employment.
Macron’s more ambitious idea is to take a big leap toward a eurozone fiscal union, with a common treasury and a single finance minister.
This would enable, in his view, permanent fiscal transfers from the stronger countries to countries that are disadvantaged by the eurozone’s common monetary policy.
The eurozone budget would be financed by contributions from member states’ tax receipts.
A separate eurozone parliament would provide political oversight and accountability.
Such fiscal unification would make it possible for countries like France to increase infrastructure spending and boost job creation without busting fiscal ceilings.
A fiscal union backed up by deeper political integration makes eminent sense.
At least it represents a coherent path out of the eurozone’s present no man’s land.
But Macron’s unabashedly Europeanist policies are not just a matter of politics or principle. They are also critical to the success of his economic program.
Without either greater fiscal flexibility or transfers from the rest of the eurozone, France is unlikely to get out of its employment funk soon.
The success of Macron’s presidency thus depends to a large extent on European cooperation.
And that brings us to Germany.
Angela Merkel’s initial reaction to the election’s outcome was not encouraging.
She congratulated Macron, who “carries the hopes of millions of French people,” but she also stated that she would not consider changes in eurozone fiscal rules.
Even if Merkel (or a future government under Martin Schulz) were more willing, there is the problem of the German electorate.
Having portrayed the eurozone crisis not as a problem of interdependence, but as a morality tale – thrifty, hard-working Germans pitted against profligate, duplicitous debtors – German politicians will not have an easy time bringing their voters along on any common fiscal project.
Anticipating the German reaction, Macron has countered it: “You cannot say I am for a strong Europe and globalization, but over my dead body for a transfer union.”
That, he believes, is a recipe for disintegration and reactionary politics: “Without transfers, you will not allow the periphery to converge and will create political divergence towards extremists.”
France may not be in the European periphery, but Macron’s message to Germany is clear: Either you help me out and we build a true union – economic, fiscal, and eventually political – or we will be run over by the extremist onslaught.
Macron is almost certainly right.
For the sake of France, Europe, and the rest of the world, we must hope that his victory is followed by a German change of heart.

Europe’s Triple Threat
PALO ALTO – Europe is suffering from simultaneous sovereign-debt, banking, and currency crises.
Severe economic distress and political pressure are buffeting relationships among citizens, sovereign states, and supranational institutions such as the European Central Bank.
Calls are rampant for surrendering fiscal sovereignty; for dramatic recapitalization of the financially vulnerable banking system; and/or for Greece and possibly other distressed eurozone members to quit the euro (or for establishing an interim two-tier monetary union).
In this combustible environment, policymakers are desperately using various vehicles – including the ECB, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Financial Stability Facility – in an attempt to stem the financial panic, contagion, and risk of recession.
But are officials going about it in the right way?
The sovereign debt, banking, and euro crises are closely connected.
Given their large, battered holdings of peripheral eurozone countries’ sovereign debt, many of Europe’s thinly capitalized banks would be insolvent if their assets were marked to market.
Their deleveraging inhibits economic recovery.
And the large fiscal adjustment necessary for Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, if not Italy and Spain, will be economically and socially disruptive.
Default likely would be accompanied by severe economic contraction – Argentina’s GDP fell 15% after it defaulted in 2002.
Despite stress tests, bailout funds, and continual meetings, a permanent workable fix has so far eluded European policymakers.
Failure will erect a huge obstacle to European economic growth for years to come, and could threaten the survival of the euro itself.
Disagreement among and between heads of state and the ECB over the Bank’s purchases of distressed sovereign debt have only added to the uncertainty.
A decent pan-European economic recovery, and successful gradual fiscal consolidation, would allow the distressed sovereign bonds to rise in value over time.
Until then, the jockeying will continue over who will bear the losses, when, and how. Will it be Greek citizens?
German, French, and Dutch taxpayers? Bondholders?
Financial institutions’ shareholders? And the fundamental problem is that how the battle is resolved will affect the amount of the losses.
Prices of bank shares and the Euribor-OIS spread (a measure of financial stress) signal a profound lack of confidence in the sovereign debt of distressed countries, with yields on ten-year Greek bonds recently hitting 25%.
The crisis affects non-Europeans too; for example, concern over the exposure of American banks and money-market funds to troubled European banks is harming US financial markets.
There are three basic approaches to resolving the banking crisis (which means resolving the fiscal adjustment, sovereign debt, and euro issues simultaneously).
The first approach relies on time, profitability, and eventual workout.
One estimate suggests that a 50% reduction in the value of peripheral countries’ sovereign debt (reasonable for Greece, but high for the others) would cause about $3 trillion in losses, overwhelming the capital of European banks.
But the banks are profitable ongoing enterprises in the current low-interest-rate environment, because they typically engage in short-term borrowing and longer-term lending at higher rates, with leverage.
Playing for time thus might enable them gradually to recapitalize themselves by retaining profits or attracting outside capital.
A strong, durable economic recovery would make such an approach workable.
Most European officials hope that, when combined with substantial public money to support troubled sovereign debt, it will.
The Obama administration adopted this option, following the unpopular Troubled Asset Relief Program, which injected hundreds of billions of public dollars into the banking system (most of which has been repaid).
But some US banks, including Bank of America and Citi, are still vulnerable, with considerable toxic assets (mainly related to home mortgages) on their balance sheets.
The second approach is rapid resolution.
But letting questionable banks gradually recapitalize themselves and resolving the bad debt later – perhaps with European Brady Bonds (zero-coupon bonds which in the 1990’s enabled US banks and Latin American countries to agree to partial write-downs) – won’t work if the losses are too large or the recovery is too fragile.
More rapid resolution may be necessary to prevent zombie banks from infecting the financial system.
The US Resolution Trust Corporation rapidly shut down 1,000 insolvent banks and Savings and Loans from 1989 to 1995 so that they would not damage healthy institutions.
Scaled to today’s economy, assets worth $1.25 trillion were sold off, with 80% of the value recovered.
The financial system rapidly returned to health.
This approach requires judgment and resolve in separating insolvent institutions from solvent ones.
Finally, there is the path of public capital.
If market-driven recapitalization is too slow, and closing failing institutions is impossible, a more extreme alternative is to inject public capital directly into the banks (rather than indirectly, as now, by propping up the value of the sovereign debt that they hold).
This approach prevents bank runs, because banks with more capital are safer.
But how much public capital should be used, and on what terms?
Private capital, of course, is preferable, but, given the risk that it will be wiped out by future public intervention, investors will be wary.
In the meantime, regulators are increasing banks’ capital ratios.
Europeans, both debtors and creditors, must address the banking problem forthrightly, and simultaneously with the euro, sovereign-debt, and fiscal-adjustment issues.
Pretending that banks that passed modest stress tests can be kept open indefinitely with little collateral damage is wishful – and dangerous – thinking.

Build Your Own Talent Magnet
WASHINGTON, DC – Around the world, the creation of good new jobs is increasingly concentrated in some of the largest cities.
Innovative people want to work and live in close proximity to one another.
This process of talent agglomeration has accelerated in recent decades and shows no signs of abating.
It has also produced some increasingly glaring adverse side effects: worsening congestion (of roads, schools, and social services) in megacities; economic segregation as lower-income people are pushed out of big cities by rising housing costs; and potentially deeper social polarization as people elsewhere feel excluded from the best opportunities.
One response to the urban boom has been to introduce congestion pricing.
Urban tolls that vary with traffic levels are already in use in places like London, Singapore, and Stockholm.
New York City will introduce a version for the busiest part of Manhattan in 2021, Seattle is watching closely, and Northern Virginia is already implementing on major arteries.
It can cost up to $25 to take Interstate 66 inbound to Washington, DC, during rush hour (it’s free off-peak).
However, congestion pricing raises the cost of living and further reduces middle-class families’ access to places with the best opportunities.
An alternative approach is to focus on building innovation ecosystems that are not necessarily in the largest cities.
Some of my colleagues at MIT run a Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP), which helps local leaders construct viable coalitions, including universities, government, the existing private sector, actual entrepreneurs, and venture capital.
This approach, pioneered by Fiona Murray and Phil Budden, has proved to have great appeal around the world.
Everyone thinking about economic development and innovation faces a variant of the same question: Where will the good jobs come from?
Established strategies, such as just getting people into any job, are no longer satisfactory.
People need jobs that pay living wages (or better).
And when employers want to hire, as in some places in the Midwestern United States, they report significant weaknesses in terms of available local skills and appropriate vocational training.
Helping entrepreneurs’ businesses grow and attract financing is always a critical part of the puzzle, as emphasized by MIT’s Bill Aulet and Shari Loessberg.
But the practical process of building stronger innovation clusters is not one size fits all.
In some parts of the world, the solution may include building faster local transport links.
For example, reducing the travel time between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield would create a much more integrated labor market for creative talent in the north of England.
In other places, an important part of the task may be to change the local technical university’s strategy and deepen its engagement with industry.
Ivory towers are a thing of the past, at least with respect to the development of new technology.
I am impressed by the number of senior university officials who now make this point.
At the same time, those responsible for developing an innovation ecosystem need to pay attention to how many jobs are created for people at different education levels.
It is no longer enough to assume that if you are innovative in a particular place, there will necessarily be associated manufacturing jobs.
The future of manufacturing in countries like the US seems bright, in part because automation means that labor costs become less important when considering where to build new plants.
But a corollary is that such manufacturing will be much less labor intensive than in the past.
As my MIT colleague Scott Stern likes to say: no one is in charge of entrepreneurship.
The idea that government – at any level – can or will directly create more new companies is an illusion.
At the same time, local government is an important part of the REAP coalitions, particularly in places where urban-renewal initiatives are underway.
Transit needs to be modernized, land often needs to be cleaned up before it can be reused, and education systems must be strengthened.
These are all government responsibilities.
In addition, as Jon Gruber and I argue in our book, Jump-Starting America, national governments can catalyze both the development of new science and frameworks that encourage commercialization.
Research and development is labor intensive: each scientist needs 3-5 lab technicians, depending on the process, and these are generally well-paid jobs.
In addition, as a cluster becomes stronger, it creates more good jobs in ancillary business and personal services, all of which are local and hard to outsource to faraway places.
America’s trading partners in Europe and Asia are attracted to this idea.
It is easy enough to implement through various forms of competition among local governments – like the bidding process for Amazon’s second headquarters.
The difference is that governments would compete by offering complementary local investments (such as infrastructure, schooling, and public amenities), rather than tax breaks.
As the biggest cities attract more talent, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to remain productive.
High real-estate prices discourage young people from trying to break into an area.
Diffusing the development process geographically by embracing a broader and deeper process for nurturing innovation ecosystems strengthens national economies and helps countries as they compete to be the places where next-generation technology is invented and manufactured.
Countries that don’t adopt some version of this process will lose out to those that do.

Trumpian Uncertainty
NEW YORK – Every January, I try to craft a forecast for the coming year.
Economic forecasting is notoriously difficult; but, notwithstanding the truth expressed in Harry Truman’s request for a one-armed economist (who wouldn’t be able to say “on the other hand”), my record has been credible.
In recent years, I correctly foresaw that, in the absence of stronger fiscal stimulus (which was not forthcoming in either Europe or the United States), recovery from the Great Recession of 2008 would be slow.
In making these forecasts, I have relied more on analysis of underlying economic forces than on complex econometric models.
For example, at the beginning of 2016, it seemed clear that the deficiencies of global aggregate demand that have been manifest for the last several years were unlikely to change dramatically.
Thus, I thought that forecasters of a stronger recovery were looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses. Economic developments unfolded much as I anticipated.
Not so the political events of 2016.
I had been writing for years that unless growing inequality – especially in the US, but also in many countries throughout the world – was addressed, there would be political consequences.
But inequality continued to worsen – with striking data showing that average life expectancy in the US was on the decline.
These results were foreshadowed by a study last year, by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which showed that life expectancy was on the decline for large segments of the population – including America’s so-called angry men of the Rust Belt.
But, with the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country.
And while America might be at the extreme of this trend, things were little better elsewhere.
But, if it seemed clear that there would be political consequences, their form and timing were far less obvious.
Why did the backlash in the US come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend, rather than earlier?
And why did it manifest itself in a lurch to the right?
After all, it was the Republicans who had blocked assistance to those losing their jobs as a result of the globalization they pushed assiduously. It was the Republicans who, in 26 states, refused to allow the expansion of Medicaid, thereby denying health insurance to those at the bottom.
And why was the victor somebody who made his living from taking advantage of others, openly admitted not paying his fair share of taxes, and made tax avoidance a point of pride?
Donald Trump grasped the spirit of the time: things weren’t going well, and many voters wanted change.
Now they will get it: there will be no business as usual. But seldom has there been more uncertainty.
Which policies Trump will pursue remains unknown, to say nothing of which will succeed or what the consequences will be.
Trump seems hell-bent on having a trade war.
But how will China and Mexico respond?
Trump may well understand that what he proposes will violate World Trade Organization rules, but he may also know that it will take a long time for the WTO to rule against him.
And by then, America’s trade account may have been rebalanced.
But two can play that game: China can take similar actions, though its response is likely to be more subtle.
If a trade war were to break out, what would happen?
Trump may have reason to think he could win; after all, China is more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China, which gives the US an advantage.
But a trade war is not a zero-sum game. The US stands to lose as well.
China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain.
And the Chinese may be in a better position to respond to US attempts to inflict pain on them than the US is to respond to the pain that China might inflict on Americans.
It’s anybody’s guess who can stand the pain better.
Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?
More broadly, the Republican/Trump agenda, with its tax cuts even more weighted toward the rich than the standard GOP recipe would imply, is based on the idea of trickle-down prosperity – a continuation of the Reagan era’s supply-side economics, which never actually worked.
Fire-breathing rhetoric, or raving three a.m. tweets, may assuage the anger of those left behind by the Reagan revolution, at least for a while.
But for how long?
And what happens then?
Trump might like to repeal the ordinary laws of economics, as he goes about his version of voodoo economics. But he can’t.
Still, as the world’s largest economy leads the way into uncharted political waters in 2017 and beyond, it would be foolhardy for a mere mortal to attempt a forecast, other than to state the obvious: the waters will almost certainly be choppy, and many – if not most – pundit ships will sink along the way.

A New Year’s Banking Union
BRUSSELS – Five years after the outbreak of the financial crisis, Europe’s economic and political situation remains fragile.
A mild recession is expected in Europe this year, and unemployment is on the rise.
Beyond deficit reduction, we need to implement a €120 billion ($155 billion) European investment plan, and deepen the European Single Market to unleash its growth potential.
But we also need other structural measures.
The European Union must put an end to the negative feedback loop between individual member states and their national banking systems.
Between 2008 and 2011, EU taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion in loans and guarantees.
In some countries, the threat of bank recapitalization with public funds has resulted in a drop in market confidence and a huge rise in interest rates.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has taken decisive action to break this vicious circle.
Moreover, there is now a consensus that the 17 eurozone countries need a banking union to accompany their common currency.
The European Commission has proposed a single rulebook for banks’ capital requirements; mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes; and Europe-wide rules for resolving failing banks that place the main burden on bank shareholders and creditors, not on taxpayers.
On June 29, European heads of state and government committed themselves to the creation of a single European supervisor for banks in the eurozone.
This is good news for both financial stability and public finances: once the single supervisor is in place, supervision will be more credible and impartial, which is important for dealing with ailing banks and managing their return to viability.
The European Commission also put forward a set of legislative proposals to establish the single supervisory mechanism and confer key supervisory tasks on the ECB.
This proposal must now be amended and approved as soon as possible by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers if we are to have a chance of activating the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and proceeding with the other essential pillars of a banking union.
Further work, however, is still needed in several areas:
Entry into force in January 2013 would bring about supervision by the ECB of banks that have received or requested public funding.
Only in July 2013 would all banks of major systemic importance be subject to ECB supervision.
The remaining banks would be subject to the new mechanism at the start of 2014.
Intense discussions are normal for such a high-stakes project.
Countries like Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands are right to argue that rapid progress cannot come at the expense of the new supervisory structure’s quality.
But EU countries have to stick to the commitment that they made in June and strike a deal in time for a gradual entry into force in January 2013.

The World and the UN Must Reduce Population Growth
GOTHENBURG/LONDON – On September 24-25, world leaders will gather at the United Nations in New York to review progress toward the UN’s 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
The SDGs, which aim “to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all,” are commendable, and summarize the kind of world many of us wish to see in 2030.
But if this vision is to have any chance of materializing, governments must now add an 18th goal: “Dampen population growth.”
The challenges that humanity faces today stem mainly from overconsumption and overpopulation.
Yet policymakers often fail to consider the two factors together, and largely neglect population growth in particular.
The overall human impact on the global environment is the product of population size and average per capita consumption.
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that population growth and economic (consumption) growth are the two main causes of global warming.
Per capita resource consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions are highest in developed economies, while rapid population growth in developing countries contributes to the loss of forests and biodiversity.
When governments adopted the SDGs in 2015, many experts were surprised by the lack of attention to population growth.
Demographer Joseph Chamie, a former director of the UN Population Division, expressed concern that the UN was ignoring the issue.
University of Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta and co-authors concurred, arguing that this omission “should be a point of public concern.”
More recently, demographer Massimo Livi Bacci of the University of Florence wrote that “population … has become irrelevant for the sustainability of development, notwithstanding the evidence to the contrary.”
Between 1960 and 2000, the world’s population doubled from three billion to six billion.
This growth contributed to greater pollution of land, lakes, rivers, and oceans, as well as urban overcrowding and a higher demand for agricultural land and freshwater (in turn encroaching on natural ecosystems).
Despite significant technical advances in agriculture, famines killed millions of people over this 40-year period.
And in developing countries, rapid population growth left poor people at greater risk of death, injury, and disease resulting from pollution, floods, droughts, and other disasters.
There are now 7.7 billion people on Earth.
The UN forecasts that this figure will rise to 11 billion by 2100 (and that assumes steady fertility declines in many countries that have tended to resist this trend).
A population increase on this scale would create more pollution, require a doubling of global food production under difficult conditions (including climate disruption), and result in more people suffering during conflicts and famines.
To be sure, there has been plenty of necessary research into how the world can better accommodate billions more people, in terms of pollution, agriculture, energy efficiency, and climate change.
But such research fails to quantify the benefits of minimizing further population increases – a critical oversight.
While many researchers and policymakers seem to regard a rapidly increasing global population as inevitable, ordinary citizens recognize the serious problems and risks that this will cause.
In a 2014 survey by the Global Challenges Foundation, a majority of 9,000 respondents in nine countries (the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Germany, Poland, Sweden, India, Russia, and China) considered population increase to be an actual or potential future threat to mankind.
The same year, a Pew Research Center survey reported that 82% of American scientists regarded the growing world population as a major problem because “there won’t be enough food and resources.”
Yet the huge projected increase in the world’s population this century is avoidable.
The size of the population in 2100 can be influenced now by international debate, government programs, and individual choices.
More specifically, an additional SDG to dampen population growth would promote funding for voluntary, rights-based family planning.
This approach has a proven track record of success, not only in reducing births rapidly, but also in advancing the empowerment of women and spurring economic progress.
No coercive “population control” measures are needed.
Rather, wider awareness of the linkage between family size and ecological sustainability can help parents recognize the benefits of having fewer children.
Clearly, population growth cannot be stopped overnight, nor feasibly by 2030.
But we could establish trends toward a population peak and decline in all countries by then.
This includes not only developing countries, where population growth threatens security, but also rich countries with large ecological footprints, where population decline and its benefits are resisted because of ill-founded fears of demographic aging.
Reproductive rights and family planning are mentioned in both SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) and SDG 5 (gender equality), but neither goal explicitly aims to reduce population growth.
As they currently stand, the SDGs imply that there is no longer any need to curb the global population increase, even though it undermines most of the goals.
As a result, there is a big risk that the world will achieve little of the 2030 Agenda, especially in countries where high birth rates persist. But we should not give up.
Changes in population policies and norms can reduce birth rates.
And by adopting a new SDG to this effect, the world could yet save the 2030 Agenda.

Europe's New Dawn
Today in Rome, the heads of state and government of the EU's 25 member states will sign the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
We have come a long way since the six founding members formed the European Economic Community back in March 1957 - also in Rome.
After the Treaty is signed, it will go before the national parliaments for approval. So it is crucially important to understand why the Treaty deserves to be ratified.
Simply put, it places the interests of Europe's citizens more than ever at the heart of the European Union's activities. It does so in four ways.
First, the Constitutional Treaty guarantees that the Union's institutions will respect the fundamental rights of everyone within the EU.
The "catalogue of fundamental rights" included in the Constitution is extensive, centering on respect for human dignity, freedom, and equality, and also on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
By enshrining them in the Constitution, these fundamental rights and principles become legally binding, and citizens will have greater scope for bringing appeals to the Court of Justice.
In this respect, the EU leads the world in the protection of fundamental rights.
Second, the Treaty makes the EU more democratic and brings government closer to Europe's citizens.
The Union has no business interfering in matters that can be dealt with successfully at the local, regional, or national level.
The EU's objectives are precisely those that countries are unable to achieve on their own, for example, a stronger economy and greater security.
The Constitutional Treaty includes guarantees to ensure that the EU adheres to this principle strictly.
National parliaments will be able to call a time-out if Brussels makes proposals that seem to interfere unnecessarily.
Should one-third of national parliaments so wish, the European Commission will be required to reconsider a proposal.
In addition, the Constitutional Treaty gives citizens the right to ask the European Commission to take action on a specific point.
A citizens' initiative of this kind will require one million signatures, obtained in different countries.
At the same time, the European Parliament will have far greater powers.
It will have joint decision-making authority in many more areas, including the budget.
As a result, European citizens' elected representatives will be better able to scrutinize the work of the Commission.
Third, the Treaty makes the EU more open and more transparent.
Citizens want powers to be clearly defined and decisions to be taken openly in a way that they can understand.
Many people despair of finding their way through the maze of current EU treaties and their numerous amendments.
Outside Brussels, few people can explain the "pillar" structure and the distinction between the Union and the Community.
The Constitution consigns these complexities to history.
It also gives people far greater access to official information, extending their right of access to documents from all institutions, organs, and bodies.
Finally, the Treaty will make Europe more effective.
This is essential if the issues that affect people's lives are to be tackled successfully.
Two themes that people consider crucial are a stronger European economy (more jobs and more growth) and greater security (reducing cross-border crime).
European countries are heavily reliant on each other in addressing these issues.
People are counting on Europe to take action.
But, because EU decisions often have to be taken unanimously, this can be difficult.
Moreover, the means to work together effectively are often lacking.
The Treaty introduces major improvements here, enabling us to work together more effectively to achieve our aims.
In sum, the Constitutional Treaty firmly enshrines fundamental rights in law, and also makes the EU more democratic, more transparent, and more effective.
This makes it a good deal for everyone - for people who expect more cooperation and more concrete results from the Union, but also for those concerned about excessive interference by Europe in questions that can be better dealt with by the member states themselves.
Next year, we will celebrate 60 years of peace across a large part of Europe.
Never before in our history have we enjoyed such a long period of concord, a period that has seen an enormous growth in prosperity.
Democracy has taken root in almost every corner of Europe, and Europeans now have far greater freedom to live, work, and study where and how they wish.
These achievements are largely due to European cooperation.
The Constitutional Treaty is a reflection of our wish to continue in the same vein, to carry on working together.
We want to reaffirm our commitment to a life without war and injustice, and to the freedom that we hold so dear.
The Constitutional Treaty provides solid foundations for our shared future.
Peace, security, and prosperity are as vulnerable as they are valuable.
This Treaty makes them stronger. And that makes us stronger.
The signing ceremony is therefore a message of hope.
It is a new beginning.

The G-7’s Sustainability Mission
FRANKFURT – In six months, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Paris in an effort to reach a global accord to fight climate change.
When the G-7’s leaders meet next week in Germany, they should use the occasion to take the first steps toward avoiding the most dangerous consequences of global warming.
With the world’s safety and prosperity at stake, the question is not whether or when to begin the transition to a low-carbon economy, but how to manage the effort.
In 2014, investments in clean energy reached a new high of $310 billion, after two years of decline.
That is good news, but it is still far short of the $1.1 trillion per year that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates is needed in the low-carbon energy sector.
In the meantime, some $950 billion was invested in oil, gas, and coal in 2013 – a figure that has doubled in real terms since 2000.
The value of an investment is based largely on the perception of how risky it is.
Investment will not shift decisively toward greener sources of energy unless and until portfolio managers begin to account for the risks of dangerous climate change.
Investors also need to consider “carbon bubbles,” the overvaluation of fossil-fuel companies based on the assumption that they will be able to continue burning the world’s reserves until depletion.
Until recently, traditional forms of energy production have had the advantage of being based on established and mature industries.
But the tides are shifting.
Sovereign wealth funds and institutional and private investors are increasingly recognizing that climate change will undermine their returns, and that governments eventually will begin to address the problem.
Likewise, the Bank of England is undertaking important work on the risk that assets like coal or oil reserves could be “stranded” by policy changes intended to limit dangerous climate change.
And the G-20 finance ministers recently requested that the Financial Stability Board undertake a broad assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities.
The G-7 countries should clearly signal that they are serious about the low-carbon transition, and the most effective way to do that would be to support a global goal of cutting net greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050.
In addition, governments and regulators can take concrete steps to stimulate private-sector investment in cleaner forms of energy.
For starters, governments should take the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath and pledge to do no active harm to the planet.
The New Climate Economy Report, released by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, on which I serve, underlines the importance of phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies and questions the wisdom of allowing export credit agencies to finance coal projects.
Governments must set themselves a firm four-year deadline to end fossil-fuel subsidies and redirect funding to areas like green infrastructure projects and development assistance.
Second, governments must lead by example.
High-level meetings in Addis Ababa and Paris later this year offer the opportunity to create synergies between the fight against climate change and financing for development and infrastructure.
Governments should also encourage public pension funds to invest responsibly, especially when it comes to the climate.
More, too, could be done to support the market for green bonds, including by issuing green government bonds.
Third, governments must create policy frameworks that foster low-carbon investments.
Putting a price on carbon is critical.
The slow but steady progress that countries are making toward this goal is encouraging.
In the meantime, governments should use a shadow carbon price and carbon discount rate in their decision-making processes.
In addition, governments and regulators should adopt policies ensuring sustainable financial-sector practices, including annual reporting by companies and investors on environmental, social, and governance issues and due diligence and risk models regarding environmental hazards.
Consideration of the possibility of stranded assets must be systematically expanded.
Finally, policymakers should foster partnerships and new instruments that nudge the economy toward low-carbon alternatives.
Development banks, for example, can help leverage private-sector investment.
And new institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are in a position to make sustainability a core mandate.
Managing the transition from an economy based on fossil fuels to one based on low-carbon alternatives will not be easy.
But that is why it is essential to begin today.
It is time for the G-7 to recognize its responsibility and lead the world toward a sustainable future.

Multilateralism for the Masses
WASHINGTON, DC – As the United Nations General Assembly gathers in New York City for its 75th session – which will open with a high-level meeting focused on “reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism” – the United States is engulfed in perhaps the most contentious presidential election in recent memory.
The outcome will have far-reaching implications for the future of international cooperation and globalization.
All over the world, nationalist populists are stoking “anti-globalist” sentiment.
Rather than address the sources of alienation, and mistrust – including income inequality, economic insecurity, and insufficient cooperation against global threats such as the current pandemic – populists manufacture bogeymen.
In the populists’ portrayal, “globalists” are a shadowy cosmopolitan elite that seek to destroy national sovereignty in the name of a self-serving agenda.
Anti-globalist rhetoric – which refers, for example, to “rootless elites” – often includes a hefty dose of anti-Semitic dog-whistling, particularly in Eastern Europe.
In the US, this anti-globalist rhetoric was recently on stark display at the Republican National Convention, where speakers implored voters not to let the Democrats – supposedly under the control of the dreaded globalist cabal – dictate what voters think or say.
At last year’s UN General Assembly, President Donald Trump declared that, “the future does not belong to globalists,” but to “patriots.”
Such statements have proved potent, convincing a growing share of voters that multilateral cooperation serves the interests of the elites and comes at the expense of “the people.”
Yet it is nationalist populists who often pursue policies that benefit the wealthiest groups; Trump’s tax reforms are a case in point.
By contrast, the global public goods that only multilateralism can deliver – from pandemic control to a healthy planet – disproportionately benefit the least privileged.
How, then, do populists so often succeed in equating international cooperation with cosmopolitan elitism?
First, they muddy the conversation by referring to globalization and multilateralism interchangeably, even though the two terms describe distinct processes.
Globalization refers to the increasing flow of goods, services, capital, labor, data, and ideas across national borders.
Many, including Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, have long argued convincingly that globalization has gone too far in many domains.
But this is very different from multilateralism, which refers to cooperation or coordination among nation-states.
While multilateralism can lead to more globalization, it doesn’t have to.
The first step toward countering the populist narrative is clarifying this distinction.
As Rodrik notes, however, multilateralism can also be overused, such as when global governance solutions are applied to areas where individual nation-states’ actions do not have significant spillover effects.
For example, if a country uses moderate tariffs or subsidies to protect or encourage the development of certain industries, the effect on competitors in other countries is likely to be small.
If the international community steps in anyway – say, by imposing rules that constrain domestic policy – it risks fueling nationalist sentiment, especially among vulnerable groups who could be facing concentrated losses as a result of the lack of domestic protection against competition.
As trade theorists have long known, diffuse gains spread over large numbers of consumers cannot compensate politically for such losses.
And some industrial policies may generate net national gains due to externalities or dynamic effects.
Just as excessive multilateral intervention can look to domestic populations like an international assault on sovereignty, it can convince voters elsewhere that their “rivals” are using national policies as economic weapons against them, fueling rather than preventing self-defeating cycles of retaliation.
Effective multilateralism thus requires us to respect national sovereignty where policies have limited spillover effects, so that it can better help manage these effects when needed.
The other populist myth that must be dispelled is that international cooperation benefits only a wealthy, footloose, and privileged global elite.
Many grassroots “people’s cosmopolitanism” movements exist, but they must grow rapidly to shrink the political space occupied by national populists.
This will require overcoming two longstanding obstacles: the distance between people and the absence of a common language.
Though still formidable, these obstacles have diminished in recent decades.
Thanks largely to digital technologies, from social media to translation apps, there are now countless ways to overcome them.
Shared challenges, such as climate change, have spurred the rise of increasingly influential and highly diverse global movements, and multilateral efforts such as the Sustainable Development Goals have fostered similar kinds of broad activism, with the UN playing a significant facilitating role.
Ironically, even nationalists are awkwardly attempting to summon a common voice and agenda.
Yet internationalist discourse is still politically costly if it appears to ignore the local and the familiar.
That is why progressive internationalism must not only celebrate diversity and nurture a global civic consciousness, but also recognize that people will always give priority to their families, communities, and countries.
Acknowledging our common humanity and shared responsibility as stewards of the planet does not require asking anyone to tear up the parochial roots that underpin their sense of belonging.
Those roots are precisely what will provide the security they need to reach out to others.
Contrary to populist myth, global solidarity does not mean caring more about children in far-flung locales than one’s own; it simply means recognizing that all children – all people – have equal value.
The UN enshrined this subtle but essential distinction in its Charter 75 years ago.
There is no better time to reaffirm it than at the upcoming UN General Assembly.

The Kremlin’s Suicidal Imperialism
MOSCOW – Not since the Soviet Union collapsed have I listened to a speech as Orwellian as the one Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered to declare that four Ukrainian regions are now Russia.
Just as communism was once supposed to save humanity from imperialist exploitation, Russia is now apparently responsible for defending countries’ right not to be subjected to a “new colonialism” that would turn them into Western vassals.
In Putin’s Russia, war is peace, slavery is freedom, ignorance is strength, and illegally annexing a sovereign country’s territory is fighting colonialism.
In Putin’s mind, he is righting a historic injustice, as the annexed regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia – were once part of Novorossiya (New Russia), brought into the Russian empire by Catherine the Great.
He is also standing up to the West – especially the United States, which has bled it of resources and dictated its actions since the Cold War – on behalf of the rest of the world.
I love a good propaganda speech – I’ve taught the subject for years.
But, coming from the leader of a country that has established itself at the center of two empires, with other states as its satellites, Putin’s rhetoric is too rich to be satisfying.
Just like Soviet leaders’ Cold War speeches, Putin’s address did not contain a single whiff of compromise.
But Putin’s assertiveness in some ways surpasses that of his Soviet predecessors.
It is instead inspired by his intellectual hero, Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin.
To be sure, Ilyin hated communism.
In fact, he praised Adolf Hitler for saving Europe from the Red Menace, and when he emigrated to Switzerland before World War II, he was thought to be an agent of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
But it is pointless to seek logic in the dystopian kasha of Russian heroes and symbols Putin serves up.
So, while he echoes Ilyin’s belief in Russia’s superiority, he compares Western leaders who “lie” about Russia to Goebbels and justifies his “special military operation” in Ukraine as necessary to “denazify” the country (with its part-Jewish president).
As absurd as it was, there was nothing surprising about Putin’s annexation speech.
In recent weeks, Russia suffered a string of military defeats in northeastern Ukraine.
The appearance of weakness is unacceptable to Putin, who compensates with increasingly aggressive rhetoric.
The more apparent it is that Russia is losing, the more forcefully Putin declares that it is not.
This is the “paradox of tyranny”: the weaker the state, the more it deprives people of basic liberties.
Simply sharing a story about the war that is not part of the Kremlin’s narrative is considered “spreading false information,” punishable since March with fines or even jail terms.
Such a state cannot solve the fundamental problems facing the country.
All it can do is discredit potential alternatives and quash any opposition.
But not all Russians are buying Putin’s narrative.
Since he announced a “partial mobilization” of Russia’s armed forces on September 21, some 200,000 people – perhaps many more – have fled to neighboring countries.
These Russians would rather sleep on the floor in an Astana shopping mall than fight Putin’s war in Ukraine.
Will this trigger another escalation from Putin?
Will Russia soon be subject to martial law?
Putin’s inner circle does not seem particularly thrilled about recent developments, either.
While they repeat the Kremlin line, the audience at his annexation speech – including former President Dmitry Medvedev, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, and Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev – sat stone-faced, their applause lukewarm.
Like the Soviet apparatchiks, they know that they must remain disciplined, obedient.
This is the Putin show, and any suggestion that the emperor’s clothes may not be all there could bring criminal charges – or even an untimely death.
This points to another facet of Russia’s paradox of tyranny.
Centralization of all power in a single person weakens governance by permitting the implementation of ineffective or even counterproductive policies, and by stifling all mechanisms for a course correction.
To challenge the leader – say, by identifying policy mistakes – is to risk everything.
None of Putin’s advisers is likely to tell him that the war in Ukraine is a strategic disaster for Russia.
They will not point out that he has already failed to achieve his original objective: to march into Kyiv and re-unify the “Russian lands.”
And they will not explain that the international community will never recognize his latest territorial claims.
This is the truth Putin hopes to paper over with nuclear bluster.
Someday, Russia’s leadership will want to mend relations with the rest of the world, not least for the economy’s sake.
And these illegally annexed territories will form a high barrier to progress.
Few countries give up lands voluntarily, and there will always be people in Russia – followers of Ilyin or Putin himself – who would cry treason if a leader gave up Donbas or Kherson, let alone Crimea.
Putin wants to be remembered as a defender of Russia.
Maybe he will even have himself written into history books in this light.
But, just as many Russians today are running away from his war in Ukraine, future Russian leaders are unlikely to welcome his imperial legacy and all the problems it creates.

Getting to Yes With Iran
WASHINGTON, DC – With the release of America’s National Intelligence Estimate, according to which Iran has suspended its nuclear weapons program, the prospect of military confrontation with the Bush administration dimmed.
But months later, it is clear that the danger is not past, because Iran has not renounced the production of nuclear weapons, which its enriched uranium could eventually be used to fuel.
All parties need to find a formula to resolve the issue before it again threatens to erupt into conflict.
Western diplomacy in recent years has focused on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as the key to resolving the crisis.
But this approach is a blind alley.
Let us recall the fate of Ahmedinejad’s two immediate predecessors.
Muhammad Khatami (1997-2005) tried to implement dramatic political reform, while Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-97) tried to open the Iranian economy to the West.
Both failed, because Iran’s presidents do not run the country.
A solution to the nuclear dilemma – or any other problem in Iran’s foreign relations – is in the hands of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Among his responsibilities, Khamenei serves as commander-in-chief of the military, controls the intelligence services, and appoints directors of the national media.
His appointees effectively control most ministries and Iran’s major cities.
In diplomacy, Khamenei tends to operate in a clever but recognizable fashion.
He sends different diplomats into negotiations with contradictory instructions.
Each claims to be acting with the Supreme Leader’s full authority, but ultimately are unable to make commitments because they have little idea of what Khamenei wants to do.
After a time, they are removed, and a new set of representatives is dispatched.
In order to dominate decision-making, Khamenei prefers weak presidents.
Ahmedinejad is no different.
His political base has faded, owing to Iran’s deepening economic crisis, which has been intensified by the conflict with the West over the nuclear issue.
His support in the parliamentary election next March seems particularly weak, which will no doubt please Western observers.
But the election results will not matter: parliament, too, has little influence over Iran’s foreign policy.
Some Western diplomats recognize the Supreme Leader’s role.
In practice, however, Western diplomacy tends to ignore Khamenei, who sabotages any effort to get around him as the final arbiter of Iranian policy. This might partly explain why Khamenei has been mistrustful of negotiations with the West.
Westerners don’t seem to understand who is in charge.
Indeed, some analysts argue that former President Bill Clinton’s efforts to achieve a breakthrough with Iran failed because they were addressed to Iran’s presidents.
The West should learn from the example of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who did not travel to Iran until he was allowed a direct meeting with Khamenei, during which Putin is reported to have made a proposal to end the nuclear stand-off.
There has been no answer yet, though there does seem to be some recent movement between Russia and Iran on the provision of nuclear fuel for Iran’s controversial reactors.
To be sure, Khamenei is reluctant to meet with non-Muslim foreign leaders.
But that shouldn’t stop the West from reaching out to him directly, or pressing him to publicly appoint the representatives who negotiate with the West.
One American politician who understands how to work with the Iranian power structure is former Congressman Lee Hamilton, now head of the Woodrow Wilson Center.
When Wilson Center researcher Haleh Esfandiari was arrested in Iran, Hamilton wrote to Khamenei, pleading for her release on humanitarian grounds.
Khamenei responded – reportedly the first time he answered an American – and Esfandiari was released in a matter of days.
Khamenei would be hard-pressed to ignore a direct invitation from the US to negotiate on Iran’s most vital concerns.
His clear priority is the Islamic Republic’s survival, not the fate of particular Iranian politicians.
While Ahmedinejad’s apocalyptic vision makes it difficult for westerners to deal with him, Khamenei does not want to stumble into a military confrontation with the West, which would destabilize Iran and possibly lead to the regime’s downfall.
To resolve outstanding issues with Iran, the West should be dealing with the only person powerful enough to make deals and deliver concessions.
That person is Khamenei, not Ahmedinejad.

Why Support the TPP?
CAMBRIDGE – Agreement among negotiators from 12 Pacific Rim countries on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) represents a triumph over long odds.
Tremendous political obstacles, both domestic and international, had to be overcome to conclude the deal.
And now critics of the TPP’s ratification, particularly in the United States, should read the agreement with an open mind.
Many of the issues surrounding the TPP have been framed, at least in US political terms, as left versus right.
The left’s unremitting hostility to the deal – often on the grounds that the US Congress was kept in the dark about its content during negotiations – carried two dangers.
A worthwhile effort could have been blocked, or President Barack Obama’s Democratic administration could have been compelled to be more generous to American corporations, in order to pick up needed votes from Republicans.
In fact, those concerned about labor rights and the environment risked hurting their own cause.
By seeming to say that they would not support the TPP under any conditions, Obama had little incentive to pursue their demands.
Seen in this light, the TPP that has emerged is a pleasant surprise.
The agreement gives pharmaceutical firms, tobacco companies, and other corporations substantially less than they had asked for – so much so that US Senator Orrin Hatch and some other Republicans now threaten to oppose ratification.
Likewise, the deal gives environmentalists more than they had bothered to ask for.
Perhaps some of these outcomes were the result of hard bargaining by other trading partners (such as Australia).
Regardless, the TPP’s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal.
The most controversial issues in the US are those that are sometimes classified as “deep integration,” because they go beyond the traditional easing of trade tariffs and quotas.
The left’s concerns about labor and the environment were accompanied by fears about excessive benefits for corporations: protection of the intellectual property of pharmaceutical and other companies, and the mechanisms used to settle disputes between investors and states.
So what, exactly, is in the finished TPP?
Among the environmental features, two stand out.
The agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
It also takes substantial steps to limit subsidies for fishing fleets – which in many countries waste taxpayer money and accelerate the depletion of marine life.
For the first time, apparently, these environmental measures will be backed up by trade sanctions.
I wish that certain environmental groups had devoted half as much time and energy ascertaining the potential for such good outcomes as they did to sweeping condemnations of the negotiating process.
The critics apparently were too busy to notice when the agreement on fishing subsidies was reached in Maui in July.
But it is not too late for environmentalists to get on board.
Similarly, various provisions in the area of labor practices, particularly in Southeast Asia, are progressive.
These include measures to promote union rights in Vietnam and steps to crack down on human trafficking in Malaysia.
Perhaps the greatest uncertainty concerned the extent to which big US corporations would get what they wanted in the areas of investor-government dispute settlement and intellectual property protection.
The TPP’s critics often neglected to acknowledge that international dispute-settlement mechanisms could ever serve a valid purpose, or that some degree of patent protection is needed if pharmaceutical companies are to have sufficient incentive to invest in research and development.
There was, of course, a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far.
The dispute-settlement provisions might have interfered unreasonably with member countries’ anti-smoking campaigns, for example.
But, in the end, the tobacco companies did not get what they had been demanding; Australia is now free to ban brand-name logos on cigarette packs.
The TPP also sets other new safeguards against the misuse of the dispute-settlement mechanism.
Likewise, the intellectual property protections might have established a 12-year monopoly on the data that US pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies compile on new drugs (particularly biologics), thereby impeding competition from lower-cost generic versions.
In the end, these companies did not get all they wanted; while the TPP in some ways gives their intellectual property more protection than they had before, it assures protection of their data for only 5-8 years.
The focus on new areas of deep integration should not obscure the old-fashioned free-trade benefits that are also part of the TPP: reducing thousands of existing tariff and non-tariff barriers.
Liberalization will affect manufacturing sectors such as the automotive industry, as well as services, including the Internet.
Liberalization of agriculture – long a stubborn holdout in international trade negotiations – is noteworthy.
Countries like Japan have agreed to let in more dairy products, sugar, beef, and rice from more efficient producers in countries like New Zealand and Australia.
In all these areas and more, traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply: new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living.
Many citizens and politicians made up their minds about TPP long ago, based on seemingly devastating critiques of what might emerge from the negotiations.
They should now look at the outcome with an open mind.
They just might find that their worst nighttime fears have vanished by the light of day.

Ukraine Versus the Vultures
OXFORD – Amid all of its other troubles, Ukraine cannot pay its creditors.
The country needs more money, serious reform, and a rescheduling of its debt.
Yet even the best efforts by the International Monetary Fund, the United States, and the European Union to achieve this will be hobbled by investment agreements that they themselves have pressed on Ukraine and many other emerging economies.
Indeed, Ukraine could be left facing a string of complex and costly legal cases.
In recent years, shrewd creditor lawyers have argued that investment treaties give bondholders the same rights as foreign direct investors, and have smuggled sovereign-debt cases into international arbitration proceedings wherever they have found investment treaties with broad, open-ended definitions.
The recent experiences of Argentina, Greece, and Cyprus highlight the “blowback” on sovereign-debt restructuring.
The first such case was Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic, which started in 2008.
Thousands of Italian bondholders refused Argentina’s debt-restructuring deal, successfully arguing that the Italy-Argentina investment treaty gave them the right to pursue compensation through investor-state arbitration.
Resolving a sovereign-debt crisis requires a collective agreement by creditors, which can be achieved only by individual investors’ incentive to try to grab their money and run.
That is why investment treaties that leave an opening for holdouts are counterproductive.
In national jurisdictions, a bankruptcy mechanism is used to corral creditors.
But no such mechanism exists at the international level.
The IMF proposed one in 2002; but, in the face of concerted lobbying by investors, the scheme was rebuffed and instead an agreement was reached to use collective action clauses (CACs) in debt contracts.
The Eurogroup, for example, has declared that all eurozone sovereign bonds issued after January 1, 2013, should include CACs, which render a government’s debt-restructuring proposal legally binding on all bondholders if a majority of bondholders accept the deal.
When these clauses work, they streamline debt restructurings.
In the Greek case, CACs were retroactively inserted into all Greek-law debt.
This allowed for a faster and more orderly restructuring than otherwise would have been possible.
The troika – the IMF, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission – encouraged the Greek government to insert the collective action clauses.
Yet now that very maneuver is being challenged as expropriation in international arbitration.
The same could easily happen to Ukraine, which has ratified more than 50 investment treaties.
Their relevant clauses are similar – often identical – to those in Greece’s investment treaties, enshrining broad, open-ended definitions of investment that do not exclude sovereign debt.
Moreover, many of the treaties provide investors with direct access to arbitration.
So what can be done?
For starters, the countries that have investment treaties with Ukraine can add annexes making it explicitly clear that sovereign debt is excluded.
Renegotiating more than 50 treaties would be unwieldy, but Ukraine would benefit enormously by renegotiating just one: the US-Ukraine investment treaty.
By some estimates, more than 20% of Ukrainian government debt was recently purchased by a single American investment fund, Franklin Templeton Investments, specializing in distressed debt.
So, before the blowback begins, policymakers would do well to heed the strong precedent for excluding sovereign debt from a US investment treaty.
Although US investment treaties are uniform on most issues, they have remarkably diverse approaches to sovereign debt.
Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement explicitly excludes sovereign debt.
Similarly, the US-Uruguay Bilateral Investment Treaty and the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement both have annexes that effectively exclude sovereign debt.
For US policymakers, the decision to add an annex excluding sovereign debt is a tough choice.
On the one hand, US investment treaties are designed to secure the strongest possible protection for US investors overseas.
To remove investment protection – at a time of instability and insecure property rights, no less – is antithetical to the purpose of such treaties.
Given the political and security imperatives of the crisis in Ukraine, however, the alternative is worse.
Doing nothing means allowing US investment funds to pursue enormous compensation cases – likely in the billions of dollars – against a future Ukrainian administration, which, even in the best-case scenario, will be on weak domestic political footing and already saddled with an unpopular austerity program and loan-repayment schedule.
This outcome would be more than a public-relations nightmare; with Russia beckoning, it might well hasten geostrategic disaster.
Ideally, the world would have a well-functioning international mechanism for sovereign-bond restructuring.
We are far from that.
Yet before the cameras turn away from Ukraine, officials and leaders can ensure that a future administration there is not left facing bondholders one by one in international arbitration proceedings.
The US and Western Europe have an overriding strategic interest in patching this hole in the international financial architecture, and preventing their private investment funds from aggressively seeking compensation from a future Ukrainian administration.
To do otherwise risks far more than financial loss.

A Warrant of Hypocrisy
LONDON – Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) upheld the request of the court’s chief prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Omar el-Bashir, the President of Sudan, charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Bashir responded by expelling foreign aid agencies looking after the refugee camps in Darfur.
This is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes, with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism.
Both positions are hopelessly buried in intellectual and moral fog.
The warrant was no leap forward.
From the legal point of view, it makes no difference whether the accused is a sitting or former head of state.
But it makes an enormous practical difference that an incumbent ruler can do a lot more future damage to his people than an ex-ruler, and therefore should be given no incentive to retaliate.
As a result of Bashir’s policies, 300,000 people are estimated to have died and 2.7 million displaced in Darfur.
The expulsion of the aid agencies has put over a million Darfuris at risk of epidemics and starvation.
According to the statute that established the ICC, the prosecutor is required to ensure that any prosecution is in the interests of the victims as well as of justice.
But, to lawyers like the ICC prosecutor, the abstract claims of justice are more vivid than any concrete duty of protection.
In this case, justice comes with poisoned arrows.
Emboldened by the warrant and its elusive suggestion of international support, the Darfuri rebels, the Justice and Equality Movement, have walked out of peace talks with Sudan’s government.
Meanwhile, Bashir, with little to lose, will no doubt take the opportunity to attack his enemies.
The counter-argument is that the threat of indictment will deter rulers from wicked behavior.
But the law will deter only if its sanctions are credible.
A law that cannot be enforced deters no one.
In fact, it weakens respect for law.
Moreover, while the fear of being hauled off to The Hague may have some effect in deterring rulers from committing crimes against humanity, the claim that the Bashir warrant will deter the current crop of human rights’ violators is derisory.
Indeed, it is likely to prolong wicked regimes.
Robert Mugabe, for example, refuses to leave office – at great cost to Zimbabwe’s people – for fear of being put on trial.
Whatever the attractions of giving criminals “nowhere to hide, whatever the consequences,” the consequences cannot be ignored when the criminals are heads of state.
The policy of never negotiating with terrorists cannot be scaled up to state level when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake.
The charge of colonialism, meanwhile, is simply reflex: colonialism no longer exists.
The charge that international law is just “western law” is also rubbish.
International law is the conscience of mankind.
But the perception that the law is selectively applied happens to be true.
In the Nuremberg trial of 1946, which laid the basis of current international law, the main charge against the Nazi leaders was that of “planning and waging aggressive war.”
Prohibition of war except for self-defense is embedded in the United Nations Charter.
But the ICC’s creators deemed the waging of aggressive war – which the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg called “the supreme international crime” – to be outside the court’s jurisdiction.
This guaranteed legal immunity for the leaders who carried out the invasion of Iraq.
The charge of selective application also applies to the Bashir warrant.
Bashir stands accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The latter were first defined in the Nuremberg principles of 1950 to include murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and “other inhumane acts.”
In 1998, these other acts were clarified to mean false imprisonment, torture, rape, persecution of a group, enforced disappearance of persons, and apartheid.
It comes as no surprise, then, to read in the Arab News that Bashir’s warrant “reeks of hypocrisy.”
Where, indeed, are the arrest warrants for Bush and Cheney?
Does extraordinary rendition not count as “enforced disappearance of persons”?
Does the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not count as torture?
Why is Vladimir Putin not standing trial for war crimes in Chechnya?
The answer is simple: where the interests of a UN Security Council member or one of their clients are at stake, the court’s jurisdiction ends.
The ICC is like a cobweb: small flies get stuck, but wasps and hornets get through.
Until the United States ratifies the ICC treaty, the Court is bound to seem to many to be little more than a politicized kangaroo court.
Without American support, it has little hope of earning legitimacy, let alone doing its job effectively.
The Security Council has the power to defer the warrant for Bashir’s arrest for renewable periods of one year.
It can do this indefinitely, and it seems likely that it will.
The idea is that deferring the warrant will give the Security Council leverage over Sudan.
Gareth Evans, a former Australian Foreign Minister, has called it “a powerful diplomatic tool,” while the Washington Post has called for the warrant to be used “as a bargaining chip with Mr. Bashir and his Chinese and Arab allies.”
They believe that the threat of arrest can be used to force Bashir to mend his ways.
If this proves true, the ICC and its sponsors have muddled justice with diplomacy.
If the world can dispense justice only at the expense of the weak and to the advantage of the strong, it should stick to the older tools of crime prevention: force and negotiation, and leave justice out of it.

Releasing the Renminbi
BEIJING – The United States is reportedly pushing China to agree to keep the value of the renminbi stable, as part of a deal to end the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
It is a demand that China must think twice about before accepting.
The renminbi was undoubtedly undervalued for many years, including through a peg to the US dollar that was established in 1998.
A undervalued renminbi was an important contributing factor to the trade surplus that China has run consistently since 1993, when its per capita income stood at just $400.
In other words, even when China was a very poor country, it was exporting capital to the rest of the world, especially the US.
Though running a trade surplus benefits some sectors of the economy for some period of time, it is unclear that it benefits the economy as a whole in the long run.
Still, two decades of maintaining a current-account surplus (which includes trade), together with a capital-account surplus (fueled by large inflows of foreign direct investment), enabled China to accumulate huge foreign-exchange reserves and a large stock of FDI.
As a result, though China is one of the world’s largest creditors, it has run an investment-income deficit for more than a decade.
But, over the last 15 years or so, China has been working to correct its trade imbalances.
Since 2005, when the renminbi’s dollar peg was eliminated, it has appreciated steadily.
By the end of 2013, its exchange against the dollar had strengthened by 35%.
In the same year, China’s current-account surplus fell to just 2% of GDP, from its 2007 peak of 10.1%.
Moreover, since 2014, when looser capital controls left China’s capital account more responsive to broader changes in the global economy, the country has started to run significant capital-account deficits from time to time.
Sometimes, those deficits are large enough to put the entire balance of payments in deficit, despite the trade surplus.
On August 11, 2015, China took a major step to boost exchange-rate flexibility: instead of setting a daily midpoint for the renminbi independently, the People’s Bank of China began basing the midpoint on the previous day’s closing prices.
Initially, there was only slight downward pressure on the renminbi in the foreign exchange market.
But the poorly timed move ended up fueling expectations of currency devaluation, spurring a surge in capital outflows that drove down the renminbi’s value further.
Some – including former US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a recent interview – have suggested that China devalued its currency that summer, in order to offset the effects of an appreciating dollar on the economy’s international competitiveness.
The truth is that China, precisely because it feared that a depreciation would trigger even stronger expectations of further devaluation (ultimately endangering China’s financial stability), abruptly canceled the reform just days after it was initiated and began to intervene heavily in the foreign-exchange market to arrest the currency’s decline.
When those interventions slowed in 2016, the renminbi began to depreciate again, spurring the PBOC to resume intervention.
The PBOC spent some $1 trillion of China’s foreign-exchange reserves in less than two years to stem downward pressure on the exchange rate.
In 2017, thanks to the tightening of capital controls and a fall in the dollar index, the renminbi exchange rate finally stabilized.
There is no evidence that China has intervened to weaken the renminbi since – not even to offset the impact of higher US tariffs on Chinese exports – even as the exchange rate has fluctuated in response to fears about the trade war.
The Chinese government knows that it is not in its best interests to manipulate its exchange rate.
And, given China’s financial vulnerabilities, devaluation is particularly unappealing.
So, while the Trump administration’s fear that China is manipulating its exchange rate to gain a trade advantage is not irrational, it is unfounded.
Still, China cannot commit to keep the renminbi stable against the US dollar.
China’s economic cycles are not synchronized with those of the US.
The Federal Reserve may raise the federal funds rate at a time when the PBOC needs to cut its interest rate, which would spur capital outflows and drive down the renminbi’s value.
It is a country’s sovereign right to decide its exchange-rate policy, and the US cannot expect to dictate China’s.
So, even as it listens humbly to America’s complaints, China must retain full authority over its approach to the renminbi and be able to loosen monetary policy when economic conditions dictate, regardless of whether that causes the renminbi to depreciate.
The US would disapprove, but what other choice would China have?
It cannot forfeit its monetary independence, and it is not in China’s interest to block capital outflows to offset depreciation pressure.
Nor can it continue to use its hard-earned – and limited – foreign-exchange reserves to prop up the renminbi’s value.
How can China be sure the balance is enough to maintain exchange-rate stability indefinitely?
Complicating matters further, the relationship between the renminbi’s value and the US dollar is not just bilateral.
China has already committed to cut its trade surplus with the US – which comprises the majority of China’s overall trade surplus.
If the US dollar rises in this context, China’s current account is likely to swing into deficit.
Again, is China supposed to cut its imports from the rest of the world by whatever means necessary, or sacrifice its foreign-exchange reserves?
This is not a purely bilateral issue – exchange rate misalignments often require international coordination to resolve.
China’s authorities are committed to advancing the shift toward a market-driven economy, with a fully flexible exchange-rate regime.
So, in the current trade negotiations with the US, it can credibly commit not to keep the value of the renminbi artificially low.
But under no circumstances should it promise to keep the exchange rate stable against the dollar.

The Coming Anti-National Revolution
NEW HAVEN – For the past several centuries, the world has experienced a sequence of intellectual revolutions against oppression of one sort or another.
These revolutions operate in the minds of humans and are spread – eventually to most of the world – not by war (which tends to involve multiple causes), but by language and communications technology.
Ultimately, the ideas they advance – unlike the causes of war – become noncontroversial.
I think the next such revolution, likely sometime in the twenty-first century, will challenge the economic implications of the nation-state.
It will focus on the injustice that follows from the fact that, entirely by chance, some are born in poor countries and others in rich countries.
As more people work for multinational firms and meet and get to know more people from other countries, our sense of justice is being affected.
This is hardly unprecedented.
In his book 1688: The First Modern Revolution, the historian Steven Pincus argues convincingly that the so-called “Glorious Revolution” is best thought of not in terms of the overthrow of a Catholic king by parliamentarians in England, but as the beginning of a worldwide revolution in justice.
Don’t think battlefields.
Think, instead, of the coffeehouses with free, shared newspapers that became popular around then – places for complex communications.
Even as it happened, the Glorious Revolution clearly marked the beginning of a worldwide appreciation of the legitimacy of groups that do not share the “ideological unity” demanded by a strong king.
Thomas Paine’s pamphlet Common Sense, a huge bestseller in the Thirteen Colonies when it was published in January 1776, marked another such revolution, which was not identical with the Revolutionary War against Britain that began later that year (and had multiple causes).
The reach of Common Sense is immeasurable, because it wasn’t just sold but was also read aloud at churches and meetings.
The idea that hereditary monarchs were somehow spiritually superior to the rest of us was decisively rejected.
Most of the world today, including Britain, agrees.
The same could be said of the gradual abolition of slavery, which was mostly achieved not by war, but by an emerging popular recognition of its cruelty and injustice.
The 1848 uprisings around Europe were substantially a protest against voting laws that limited voting to only a minority of men: property holders or aristocrats.
Women’s suffrage followed soon after.
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we have seen civil rights extended to racial and sexual minorities.
All of the past “justice revolutions” have stemmed from improved communications.
Oppression thrives on distance, on not actually meeting or seeing the oppressed.
The next revolution will not abolish the consequences of place of birth, but the privileges of nationhood will be tempered.
While the rise in anti-immigrant sentiment around the world today seems to point in the opposite direction, the sense of injustice will be amplified as communications continue to grow.
Ultimately, recognition of wrong will wreak big changes.
For now, this recognition still faces strong competition from patriotic impulses, rooted in a social contract among nationals who have paid taxes over the years or performed military service to build or defend what they saw as exclusively theirs.
Allowing unlimited immigration would seem to violate this contract.
But the most important steps to address birthplace injustice probably will not target immigration.
Instead, they will focus on fostering economic freedom.
In 1948, Paul A. Samuelson’s “factor-price equalization theorem” lucidly showed that under conditions of unlimited free trade without transportation costs (and with other idealized assumptions), market forces would equalize the prices of all factors of production, including the wage rate for any standardized kind of labor, around the world.
In a perfect world, people don’t have to move to another country to get a higher wage.
Ultimately, they need only be able to participate in producing output that is sold internationally.
As technology reduces the cost of transportation and communications to near the vanishing point, achieving this equalization is increasingly feasible.
But getting there requires removing old barriers and preventing the erection of new ones.
Recent free-trade agreements under discussion, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, have suffered setbacks as interest groups attempt to bend them to their own aims.
But, ultimately, we need – and probably will get – even better such agreements.
To achieve factor-price equalization, people need a stable base for a real lifetime career connected to a country in which they do not physically reside.
We also need to protect the losers to foreign trade in our existing nation-states.
Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) traces its roots in the United States back to 1974.
Canada experimented in 1995 with an Earnings Supplement Project.
The European Globalization Adjustment Fund, started in 2006, has a tiny annual budget of €150 million ($168.6 million).
US President Barack Obama has proposed to expand the TAA program.
But, so far, this has meant little more than experiments or proposals.
Ultimately, the next revolution will likely stem from daily interactions on computer monitors with foreigners whom we can see are intelligent, decent people – people who happen, through no choice of their own, to be living in poverty.
This should lead to better trade agreements, which presuppose the eventual development of orders of magnitude more social insurance to protect people within a country during the transition to a more just global economy.

Latin America’s Moment
NEW YORK – Much of the world’s attention is understandably focused on developments in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.
These regions represent the vast majority of global population and wealth, their geopolitics are the most stressful (and highly consequential), and in recent decades – if not centuries – they have accounted for most of what has constituted world history.
But an unintended consequence of this focus is that many governments, corporations, and people are missing much of what is going on in Latin America.
And much of what is going on in Latin America right now happens to be good.
This may not seem obvious.
Brazil, the region’s largest country, is in the middle of a severe political crisis; the incumbent president, Dilma Rousseff, may well be on trial while the Olympics are being staged in her country later this summer.
Meanwhile, the economy shrank by nearly 4% in 2015 and is projected to contract by a similar margin this year.
The impact of the Zika virus on public health is greater in Brazil than anywhere else.
Corruption is endemic and has compromised nearly everyone in public life.
But what is also extraordinary about Brazil is that all of this has thus far taken place without violence.
Just as important, the political process is being conducted according to constitutional requirements and led by judges acting independently.
Media of every sort are covering what is going on with great intensity.
The ability to self-correct is essential for any country, and having it may be what saves Brazil from past mistakes and mismanagement.
And, yes, Venezuela – a country blessed, or quite possibly cursed, with the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world – is in far worse shape.
The country’s economy and currency have plummeted along with the price of oil.
Inflation has soared.
Political dysfunction is severe, and civil unrest and large-scale internal violence cannot be ruled out.
Yet even here there is a bit of good news.
The political opposition won a large majority in the December 2015 parliamentary election.
And lower oil prices may trigger further political change, ultimately ushering in a government that begins the process of making Venezuela a country of institutions and laws, not personality cults and abuse of power.
More broadly, many of the most important trends in the region are on balance positive.
Mexico, for decades a one-party state, is now a robust democracy that has experienced several rotations of political leadership through the ballot box.
In addition, its economy is doing relatively well.
To be sure, challenges exist, particularly when it comes to addressing drug-related crime and violence, but these problems can be managed with sustained effort.
Colombia has emerged at long last from a prolonged civil conflict.
Thanks in part to assistance from the United States, the government was strong enough to make it clear to the country’s FARC rebels that they could not shoot their way into power.
The cease-fire is holding, and prospects for a peace agreement are good.
Meanwhile, the economy is growing at a 3% annual rate, lower than in the recent past, but still higher than in many emerging economies.
Argentina provides the most recent good news.
The new government, in its first six months, has taken a number of difficult steps to restore international confidence.
In no way does this minimize what the government must achieve to reduce inflation and restore sustainable growth, but there is a palpable sense that the country, now led by a talented team of technocrats, has turned the corner.
This is good news – and not just for Argentina, because what happens there will affect thinking and behavior elsewhere, particularly in Brazil.
Progress in Argentina would show that those who violate the law can be held accountable, that excessive state intervention in the economy leads to insolvency and promotes corruption, and that democracy and markets represent the future.
Cuba in ten years is more likely to resemble its more politically and economically open neighbors than vice versa.
Again, none of this is to say that Latin America lacks real problems and challenges.
On the contrary, it has plenty of both.
But for the most part, these are matters of political and economic governance, state capacity, and corruption within states.
Missing almost entirely are problems stemming from relations between states – geopolitics – that so dominate and plague other parts of the world.
This is a tremendous advantage, as it means that governments’ attention and resources can be focused on meeting domestic needs.
The Middle East is unraveling.
Asia is challenged by territorial disputes, the rise of Chinese power, and a reckless North Korea.
Europe is all but overwhelmed by refugees, terror, and Russian revanchism.
And Africa is being held back by civil conflicts, terrorism, and poor governance.
Latin America, by contrast, looks pretty good.
Indeed, if current trends persist, it could eventually replace Europe as the world region that others regard with more than a little admiration – or even envy.

Dynastic Asia
SINGAPORE – To the extent that culture matters in politics, the recent spate of leadership changes in Northeast Asia suggests that Asian societies are more tolerant – if not supportive – of dynastic succession.
South Korea’s recently elected president, Park Geun-hye, is the daughter of Park Chung Hee, who ruled the country from 1961 to 1979.
China’s incoming president, Xi Jinping, is the son of Xi Zhongxun, a former vice premier.
Japan’s new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is the grandson and grandnephew of two former Japanese prime ministers, and the son of a former foreign minister.
Kim Jong-un is the son and grandson of his two predecessors in North Korea.
This pattern is not confined to Northeast Asia.
President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines is the son of former President Corazon Aquino.
Prime Ministers Najib Abdul Razak and Lee Hsien Loong of Malaysia and Singapore, respectively, are also sons of former prime ministers.
In India, Rahul Gandhi is waiting in the wings, preparing to step into the shoes of his great-grandfather (Jawaharlal Nehru), grandmother (Indira Gandhi), and father (Rajiv Gandhi).
In Pakistan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari – son of President Asif Ali Zardari and the assassinated former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, and grandson of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto – recently made his political debut.
Is dynastic succession becoming the norm throughout Asia?
There is no denying that a distinguished lineage gives political candidates an advantage over rivals.
But it is also clear that having distinguished relatives is no guarantee of success.
Consider the checkered record of former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
Her father was a respected president; yet she could well be remembered as one of the country’s most corrupt.
The key issue is leaders’ attitude when they assume office.
If they do so with a sense of entitlement from their lineage, they are likely to fail, as Arroyo did.
Fortunately for East Asia, most seem to approach power with a keen sense of duty and a commitment to strengthening their countries.
The term “princeling” is probably an unfair description of China’s Xi.
After all, he hardly can be said to have led a charmed life.
After his father was purged by Mao Zedong, he went to work in the countryside, even before the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, experiencing firsthand all of the hardships that many of his generation endured.
Having risen to the top, he feels no sense of entitlement.
From all accounts, he feels an even greater sense of responsibility to prove that he gained his position on the basis of merit, not privilege.
Xi must also be aware that the children of the People’s Republic’s second generation of leaders face considerable public resentment, owing to their rapid accumulation of wealth.
That explains his focus on combating corruption.
If he fails to do so, he will be deemed a failure, and the Chinese Communist Party’s political monopoly may end sooner than anyone anticipates.
Xi carries a huge burden on his shoulders.
So does Park Geun-hye.
Like Xi, she had to struggle to reach the top.
Her father lifted South Korea out of poverty and turned it into an economic tiger.
But his rule was also brutally repressive.
To make matters worse for Park, many of her predecessors are perceived as failures.
Two former presidents, Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan, were prosecuted; another, Roh Moo-hyun, committed suicide.
There are also unkind rumors swirling around outgoing President Lee Myung-bak.
South Korea is clearly a successful country that is struggling to define itself.
In theory, it should be celebrating its economic and cultural achievements.
In practice, as a small country in a troubled neighborhood – and with North Korea a constant source of tension – it lives in existential anxiety.
And Park, whose victory has not diminished her people’s ambivalent attitude toward her father, must know that healing the obvious divisions in South Korean society will not be easy.
The most difficult job is the one that awaits Rahul Gandhi.
No single party can dominate Indian politics as the Congress Party has done since independence, implying a future of difficult and quarrelsome coalitions.
In these circumstances, India needs, above all, decisive leadership.
Yet, like Hamlet, Rahul seems uncertain.
He could have taken the job several years ago, if he had chosen to do so.
His hesitation must reflect a deep anxiety.
Yet his reluctance is understandable.
Again, dynastic succession does not ensure success.
Malaysia’s Razak, for example, has made an enormous effort to reunify his country with his “1Malaysia” message.
Yet all the indications are that he will face an extremely hard-fought election in 2013.
Though unlikely, his Barisan Nasional coalition could fall apart.
No such prospect faced his predecessors.
In Japan, Abe is universally regarded to have performed badly in his first stint as Prime Minister in 2006-2007, despite his distinguished lineage.
Now he takes over an even more troubled country with huge domestic and external challenges.
Few are betting on his succeeding.
In short, Asia’s pattern of dynastic leadership does not render it immune from the challenges that the rest of the world faces.
As Asia creates the world’s largest middle class – projected to grow more than three-fold, from 500 million to 1.75 billion, by 2020 – it will also have to cope with demands for more competent and more accountable governments.
In Asia today, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

Why Mars Matters
NEW YORK – The Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars this month, marks a new leap toward answering fundamental questions about our solar system, including where else we might find DNA.
The rover will roam the surface of Mars looking for signs of life, make its own oxygen, launch a helicopter, and collect soil and rocks for a follow-up mission in 2028.
If all goes as planned, NASA, with the help of European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft, will return soil samples in the spring of 2032 – the first Martian material to visit Earth.
Finding DNA on Mars would not be a complete surprise.
Though Perseverance was constructed in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) clean room at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), even that setting cannot be made 100% free of background microbial or human DNA.
We have known about “microbial hitchhikers” since the very first interplanetary missions in the 1960s, when scientists such as Carl Sagan highlighted the problem. It is a persistent, unavoidable risk of space science.
Because scientists must build the spacecraft one layer at a time, shedding skin and droplets of saliva over years of construction, it is almost certain that a little bit of California DNA just landed on Mars.
As such, when the samples arrive on Earth in 2032, they will need to go through a “planetary-scale genetic filter” to rule out any DNA that might have been present in the SAF during the rover’s construction from 2015-20, as well as any other fragment of DNA observed on Earth up until the launch of the spacecraft in July 2020.
This is an ongoing project between our laboratory at Weill Cornell Medicine and JPL.
By sequencing the DNA found in, around, and on the SAF during the construction of robots, we will draw up a genetic map to avoid or minimize any forward or backward contamination (where we send genetic material somewhere else, or genetic material from somewhere else lands here).
Ever since the first two Soviet probes landed on Mars’s surface in 1971, followed by the US Viking 1 landing in 1976, some fragments of microbial and possibly human DNA are likely to have ended up on the red planet.
And given the planet’s global dust storms, this DNA is almost certainly located in various places across the surface.
Fortunately, we are living in an extraordinary era for genetics.
The low cost of DNA sequencing allows us to build an ever-growing genetic catalog of life on Earth, genetic maps of SAF clean rooms, and the first-ever planetary-scale genome maps (MetaSUB and the Earth Microbiome Project).
Moreover, in a 2016 mission with astronaut Kate Rubins, we showed that we can sequence DNA in space and match it to profiles of novel organisms on Earth.
Anything that can survive in space, on spacecraft, or in extreme conditions on Earth is a decent candidate for life that can survive on Mars.
Eventually, instead of sending DNA to Mars by accident, we will do it deliberately, for a purpose.
After all, manned missions to Mars are technologically achievable.
They can bring out the best in humanity, and we already have the physical, pharmacological, and biological means to pursue them.
In my new book, The Next 500 Years: Engineering Life to Reach New Worlds, I highlight studies that we performed on dozens of astronauts, including the twins Scott and (US Senator) Mark Kelly, following Scott’s one-year mission in space.
Based on our findings, we are now confident that humans can travel to Mars, and with some additional innovation and technology, stay there.
We need humans to be able to live on Mars sustainably, responsibly, and safely not so that we can abandon Earth, but because the best way to ensure our species’ survival is to make it possible to live elsewhere.
Mars is not Plan B: it is Plan A, and always has been.
We have an ethical duty to prevent our own species’ extinction as well as that of all others on Earth.
No other species (that we know of) possesses such awareness of its potential future, nor the ability to preserve life.
Only we can perform this function; and in the long term, doing so requires that we make our way to other planets.
Settling Mars is the necessary first rung on the ladder of long-term survival (not least because Venus is too hot).
To meet this imperative, however, we will need to bring NASA’s budget back to 1960s levels, when it was 4.4% of the federal budget (compared to 0.48% today).
We will need more international cooperation (including with China) as well.
To that end, my colleagues and I recently published a series of papers and launched an international collaboration on aerospace medicine that includes representatives from NASA, ESA, ROSCOSMOS (Russia), and JAXA (Japan).
The United Arab Emirates and others have also started studying space biology, and more space agencies are working with commercial platforms such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.
Some duties we choose for ourselves.
But the duty to preserve life is inextricably bound up with the awareness of our own mortality and the possibility of extinction.
Humanity’s stewardship of life is both a selfish imperative and an innate, unique obligation.
By doing what it takes to preserve life as we know it, we may yet find new life in the universe.

China on the Move
BEIJING – The debate is over.
After six years of weighing the options, China is now firmly committed to implementing a new growth strategy.
At least, that’s the verdict I gleaned from the just-completed annual China Development Forum, long China’s most important dialogue with the outside world.
There were no surprises in the basic thrust of the strategy – a structural shift in China’s investment- and export-led growth model toward a more balanced consumer-based and services-led economy.
The transformation reflects both necessity and design.
It is necessary because persistently weak global growth is unlikely to provide the solid external demand for Chinese exports that it once did.
But it is also essential, because China’s new leadership seems determined to come to grips with a vast array of internal imbalances that threaten the environment, promote destabilizing income inequality, and exacerbate regional disparities.
The strategic shift is also a deliberate effort by Chinese policymakers to avoid the dreaded “middle-income trap” – a mid-stage slowdown that has ensnared most emerging economies when per capita income nears the $17,000 threshold (in constant international prices).
Developing economies that maintain their old growth models for too long fall into it, and China probably will hit the threshold in 3-5 years.
Three insights from this year’s China Development Forum deepened my confidence that a major structural transformation is now at hand that will enable China to avoid the middle-income trap.
First, a well-articulated urbanization strategy has emerged as a key pillar of consumer-led rebalancing.
This was emphasized by China’s new senior leaders – Executive Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and Premier Li Keqiang – in the Forum’s opening and closing remarks, and considerable detail was provided in many of the working sessions.
Urbanization is a building block for consumption, because it provides powerful leverage to Chinese households’ purchasing power.
Urban workers’ per capita income is more than three times higher than that of their counterparts in the countryside.
The urban share of the Chinese population reached 52.6% in 2012 – up nearly three-fold from 18% in 1980, and is expected to rise toward 70% by 2030.
If ongoing urbanization can be coupled with job creation – a distinct possibility in light of China’s emphasis on developing its embryonic labor-intensive services sector – the outlook for household-income growth is quite encouraging.
The pace of urbanization should dispel Western doubts stemming from concerns over so-called ghost cities and chronic over-investment.
According to research by McKinsey & Company, with the annual influx of new urban residents totaling 15-20 million, China will need more than 220 large cities (at least one million people) by 2030, up from 125 in 2010.
Moreover, because urbanization is a capital-intensive endeavor and China’s capital stock per worker – a key driver of productivity growth – is still only 13% of the levels in the United States and Japan, China has good reason to remain a high-investment economy for years to come.
What is new today is the focus on urbanization’s negative externalities – especially the thorny issues of land confiscation and environmental degradation.
A well-developed “eco-city” framework was presented at this year’s Forum to counter both concerns, and features incentives promoting a new urbanization model that stresses compact land usage, mixed modes of local transportation, lighter building materials, and non-carbon energy sources.
The second insight from the 2013 China Development Forum is the new government’s focus on strengthening the social safety net as a pillar of a modern consumer society.
In particular, owing to the hukou (China’s antiquated household registration system), access to public services and benefits is not portable.
As a result, migrant workers – an underclass numbering roughly 160 million – remain shut out of government-supported health care, education, and social security.
Holes in the social safety net have led to high and rising levels of precautionary saving – driving a wedge between increases in labor income and any impetus to discretionary purchasing power.
Significantly, there were strong hints from senior Chinese leaders at the Forum that hukou reform is now under active consideration.
While that would be welcome, such efforts need to be accompanied by an expansion of benefits.
China’s retirement system has only about $430 billion of assets under management (national and local government social security and private-sector pensions).
I pressed newly appointed Finance Minister Lou Jiwei on this point, suggesting that China deploy some of its excess foreign-exchange reserves to fund such an effort – the same tactic used to provide a $200 billion start-up injection for the China Investment Corporation, the sovereign wealth fund that he ran for the previous five and a half years.
Unfortunately, he did not favor this suggestion.
The final – and possibly most important – insight that I took away from the Forum concerned the quality of China’s new leaders.
From President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on down, China’s new leadership team is quite sophisticated in terms of analytics, risk assessment, scenario modeling, and devising innovative solutions to tough problems.
Moreover, under the organizational umbrella of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) – the latter-day version of the old central planning apparatus – China has marshaled considerable resources into the formulation of a comprehensive and well-thought-out economic strategy.
But, in the end, it takes more than strong policy and analytical skills to deal with tough economic challenges.
We have seen unfortunate examples of that repeatedly in the West in recent years, and there are no guarantees that China’s newly installed leaders will avoid comparable pitfalls.
Vision and strategy are vital for realizing the “China Dream,” as the country’s new leaders are now calling it.
But it will take courage and sheer determination to tackle what is perhaps the biggest obstacle of all – resistance from deeply entrenched local and provincial power blocs.
On this critical front, strong words must be accompanied by bold action.

Biden's Wise Fed Choice
CAMBRIDGE – Give US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, credit for reappointing Jerome Powell, a Republican, to a second four-year term as chair of the United States Federal Reserve.
In doing so, Biden passed up a very strong alternative in Lael Brainard, the candidate much preferred by progressives, and who in the abstract would also have been an excellent choice.
Firmly resisting strong pressure from the left wing of the Democratic Party, Biden accomplished several things at once.
First, and most important, he reaffirmed the central bank’s independence from political pressures.
His predecessor, Donald Trump, inherited a very capable central bank head, Janet Yellen, and he acknowledged as much.
But he decided that it was preferable to have his own person in charge, perhaps hoping that he could call on Powell not to tighten monetary policy in the run-up to the 2020 election.
As with many of Trump’s decisions, this was a sharp break with tradition.
New presidents typically reappoint a competent Federal Reserve chair to serve a second term.
Biden’s choice resets the tradition.
In the unlikely event Trump were to become president again in 2025, would he feel the need to pass over Powell for a third term because Biden had endorsed him?
Probably.
In reappointing Powell, Biden also took an important step toward establishing his own independence, in particular from his party’s strident left wing, which until now has exerted enormous influence.
Biden tacked hard toward the center, basing his choice almost entirely on competence and picked a candidate whom many Republicans also endorsed.
Perhaps some of Biden’s newfound emphasis on competence will rub off elsewhere in his administration.
Having campaigned as a centrist who knows how to cross the aisle, Biden showed it when the stakes were high.
This was the most important appointment of his presidency.
Anyone who has studied political business cycles knows that the central bank can have an enormous influence by timing interest-rate cuts to gin up the economy just before an election.
At a time when the post-pandemic economy is still incredibly volatile and the tea leaves still hard to read (though frankly the US labor market looks red-hot), the choice of Powell made Fed policy more predictable and easier to interpret.
As excellent a choice as Brainard might have proved to be, there still would have been a period of adjustment for markets as they learned to understand her language and signals.
The Wall Street Journal editorial page, certain that the Fed’s policy will inevitably lead to ultra-high inflation regardless of who is in charge, dismissed the choice between Powell and Brainard as “Tweedledum and Tweedledee.”
But that denies some consequential differences.
Beyond the regulatory stances for which progressives praised her, Brainard, who will become vice chair, has shown herself especially open to innovative ideas about the evolution of central-bank policy in a world of low real interest rates.
Admittedly, I have been painting a somewhat sanguine picture of the decision to reappoint Powell.
In fact, the most recent figure for consumer price inflation, at over 6%, was eye-popping.
True, so far, financial markets seem to believe Powell’s arguement that most of it is transitory: Medium-term inflation expectations are just over 2% – not yet particularly high by the standards of the past decade.
With Powell no longer looking over his shoulder as Biden decides on his reappointment, one might argue that he will no longer feel constrained in tightening monetary policy when the need arises.
But has the Fed already waited too long?
It is a tough call.
There is a chance that the factors underpinning recent inflation spikes turn out to be transitory, so that the Fed can double down on its dovish policy and later say, “We told you so.”
Unfortunately, there is also a good chance that wage and price hikes start chasing each other, with inflation proving far from transitory.
If that happens, and if the public begins to lose confidence in price stability, it may take a rather significant recession to restore faith.
At that point, some might say that the Fed should just opportunistically recalibrate and tell everyone that it intends to raise its inflation target to 3% or 4%.
This scenario was a key recommendation of one of the core papers the Fed commissioned in its 2019 reassessment of its monetary framework.
Unfortunately, to allow inflation to drift inexorably higher, and only then tell the public that there is now a higher new normal, would most likely prove extremely destabilizing.
It has long been my view that a much more elegant way to create space for interest-rate cuts in a deep recession involves negative interest-rate policy.
True, this would require that the Fed be prepared to avail itself of one of the increasingly many options for discouraging cash hoarding that might otherwise limit the policy’s effectiveness.
Of course, the Fed could hike interest rates preemptively, but that might crash markets and put the economy into recession.
There are no easy options for the Fed at his point, and that would have been true had Brainard, not Powell, gotten the nod.
So, at the end of the day, give Biden credit for understanding that no matter how much political pressure his administration was facing to bring the Fed to heel, it was better to uphold central-bank independence – and his own.

Africa’s Domestic-Violence Epidemic
MINNA – In April, the beloved Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu died at the hands of her husband.
Accounts from relatives and friends indicate that, despite enduring severe abuse, she had stayed in her marriage because she hoped things would get better.
And Nwachukwu’s situation was hardly unique.
Earlier this month, the Kenyan actor Idah Alisha opened up about the violence she suffered before she divorced her husband, a youth pastor.
If even these famous, powerful women are not spared from domestic violence, just think of how many other women are stuck in similar situations.
In fact, there is a silent domestic-violence epidemic running rampant through communities across the continent.
According to Iheoma Obibi of Alliances for Africa, cases are rising in Nigeria.
And the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey found that, of the 5,657 women aged 15 to 49 who were polled, 47.4% had experienced physical or sexual violence.
In South Africa, before the pandemic, medical complications from intimate-partner violence constituted the second-highest burden of disease after HIV/AIDS.
Unlike Nwachukwu, whose story eventually came to light because she was a celebrity, many other women’s deaths have gone unreported.
And because prosecuting such violence is expensive, many women who survive never get justice.
Moreover, we know from our work regularly interacting with women and girls that they seldom report domestic violence because of the shame and stigma that attaches to victims.
This is part of a broader problem.
All too often, cultural beliefs and patriarchal norms encourage secrecy when it comes to women’s health issues.
Traditionally, some people believe that men have the authority to discipline a woman through torture or deprivation, and that they have a right to beat their wives if provoked.
When Alisha reported the violence she was suffering to the pastor who presided at her wedding, he reportedly replied that she deserved it.
The way he saw it, she was the problem and would need to do a better job of playing her proper role in the marriage.
Because many African countries are highly religious, faith institutions could be a powerful tool for addressing domestic violence.
But religious leaders first will have to acknowledge the problem, rather than contributing to it.
All too often, victims who seek help at church are counseled to pray and be the woman of Proverbs 31: a consummately loyal and submissive wife.
As in Proverbs, the man is assumed to be above reproach, and the woman thus wholly to blame.
Many women internalize these beliefs.
According to the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, 28% of Nigerian women believe that a husband is justified in beating his wife if she burns food, argues with him, goes out without telling him, neglects the children, or refuses sex.
And according to World Bank statistics, 51% of African women say that wife-beating can be justified, and one-third report having experienced it.
To address this problem, governments and NGOs must invest seriously in attitudinal change among girls and boys, starting in schools, where domestic-violence prevention should be part of the curriculum.
Policymakers also need to find ways to reduce the costs for women seeking access to legal services.
And religious leaders, for their part, should create educational tools and disciplinary committees to monitor their members.
Given their deep influence in Africa, religious leaders’ interventions can go a long way to check this menace.
Finally, NGOs should focus on raising awareness and carrying out public-messaging campaigns to discourage men from engaging in violence, and to help women speak out when they have become victims.
Women need to understand that even if they subscribe to traditional cultural norms and beliefs, they cannot adhere to those beliefs if they are dead.
If your spouse is threatening your life, you need to leave and find safety.
Nwachukwu’s death is receiving the full attention of the media and law enforcement.
But there are countless other women who are enduring domestic violence without justice.
Religious, political, and civil-society leaders all need to step up to end this scourge.
We cannot wait for another high-profile case to call attention to the issue.
Enough is enough.

The Asian Paradox
SEOUL – Given that the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum account for some 54% of global GDP and about 44% of world trade, the agenda for this month’s APEC summit should be drawing much global attention.
Yet the only issue in which anyone seems interested is whether or not Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet on the sidelines, and, if they do, whether a substantive discussion to ease bilateral tensions will take place.
Of course, this is not altogether unreasonable, given the two countries’ importance in shaping East Asia’s future.
Indeed, the uncertainty about whether two of APEC’s key leaders will even speak to each other highlights the grim reality of Asian international relations today.
The supposed “Asian century” is being thwarted by a paradox: deep economic interdependence has done nothing to alleviate strategic mistrust.
Given the recent deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations – a decline that accelerated in 2012, when Japan purchased the disputed Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands in Chinese) from their private owner to prevent Japanese nationalists from taking control of them – the mere fact that Abe will attend the summit is a major step.
A meeting between Abe and Xi – their first since either came to power – would offer concrete grounds for hope.
The Japanese government has made significant diplomatic efforts to orchestrate a meeting, with former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda visiting Beijing in July to try to ease tensions.
According to some media reports, in order to secure China’s agreement to participate in a meeting during the APEC summit, Abe even agreed to acknowledge that Japan’s claim to the Senkaku Islands is disputed.
Given that such a move would imply that China’s claim to the islands may have some legitimacy, Abe’s possible concession on this point is no trivial matter; it could even mean that he will agree with China to restore the status quo ante.
In that case, one hopes that Xi will follow Deng Xiaoping’s counsel and allow the issue to be “shelved for some time” so that the “wiser” next generation can “find a solution acceptable to all.”
That now seems to be a realistic possibility.
Indeed, lately Xi seems to have softened his tone, if not necessarily his diplomatic line.
For example, he allowed Li Xiaolin, the daughter of a former Chinese president, to meet with Abe, with whom she watched a performance by a visiting Chinese dance troupe in Tokyo.
And Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang shook hands with Abe at the recent Asia-Europe Meeting in Milan.
One reason for Abe and Xi’s newfound flexibility may be domestic political shifts in both countries, which have created a more equal balance between conservative, nationalist groups and more internationally-oriented business interests.
With both leaders having spent the last two years overcoming domestic opponents and consolidating their power, they may have gained confidence in their ability to compromise.
In Japan, Abe has satisfied his conservative supporters with cabinet resolutions to allow for expanded self-defense.
Despite domestic opposition to Japan’s new security doctrine, no politically influential group was able to organize an effective challenge to Abe’s approach.
Now, as Japan’s economic recovery stalls, the country’s business sector seems to be pressuring Abe’s government to work harder to mitigate the impact of its deteriorating relationship with China.
According to a Chinese government report, in the first half of 2014, Japanese direct investment in China was almost 50% lower than during the same period last year – a clear sign that Japanese business leaders fear for the future in Japan’s second largest market.
Meanwhile, in China, Xi has gained considerable confidence through his massive anti-corruption campaign, with the punishment of top military officers indicating that he has solidified his control over the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
As a result, Xi may believe that he now has more space to address the country’s economic slowdown, including by lessening the damage wrought by weakening ties with Japan.
If this assessment is accurate, the obvious next question is how much further Abe and Xi can move toward détente, thereby appeasing their business sectors, without losing the backing of nationalists, who tend to view the bilateral relationship as a zero-sum game.
For Abe, the choice is whether to tone down his nationalist rhetoric and moderate his position on contentious historical issues.
This would include halting visits to the controversial Yasukuni shrine (which honors, among others, 14 Class A war criminals who were executed after World War II) and abandoning revisionism regarding the Korean “comfort women” who were forced to provide sexual services to the Japanese Imperial Army.
How Abe decides is likely to depend on his confidence in his political position.
Similarly, if Xi remains confident enough in his control of the PLA and truly follows China’s official policy of “peaceful development,” he will be able to take the kind of prudent approach that Deng advocated.
This would entail recognizing and trying to assuage the fears that China’s rise is causing among its neighbors, as Otto von Bismarck did after German unification in 1871.
Observers might then read his recent efforts to improve relations with Japan, not to mention Vietnam, as a genuine strategic shift, rather than a temporary tactical adjustment.
In this uncertain context, the APEC summit could shed much-needed light on the intentions of Abe and Xi, thereby providing crucial insight into the trajectory of Sino-Japanese relations – and thus the future of East Asia.

The Asianized World Has Arrived
SHANGHAI – In the nineteenth century, the world was Europeanized. In the twentieth century, it was Americanized.
Asia’s rise has been swift.
Home to more than half of the world’s population, the region has climbed from low- to middle-income status within a single generation.
By 2040, it is likely to generate more than 50% of world GDP, and could account for nearly 40% of global consumption.
New McKinsey Global Institute research shows the extent to which the global center of gravity is shifting toward Asia.
Today, the region has an increasing global share of trade, capital, people, knowledge, transport, culture, and resources.
Of eight types of global cross-border flows, only waste is flowing in the opposite direction, reflecting the decision by China and other Asian countries to reduce imports of garbage from developed countries.
Asia now accounts for around one-third of global trade in goods, up from about a quarter ten years ago.
Over roughly the same period, its share of global airline travelers has risen from 33% to 40%, and its share of capital flows has increased from 13% to 23%.
Those flows have fueled growth in Asia’s cities.
The region is home to 21 of the world’s 30 largest, and four of the ten most visited.
And some of Asia’s lesser-known cities are now also on investors’ radar.
In Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial capital, greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) in knowledge-intensive sectors totaled $2.6 billion in 2017, up from virtually zero in 2007.
Similarly, Bekasi, a smaller city near Jakarta, has emerged as the Detroit of Indonesia – the center of Indonesia’s automotive and motorcycle industry.
Over the last decade, FDI in the city’s manufacturing industry has grown at an average rate of 29% per year.
And Hyderabad – which generated over 1,400 patents in 2017 – is quickly catching up with India’s Silicon Valley, Bangalore.
But it’s not only external flows being channeled into Asia. Dynamic intraregional networks are also driving progress.
Around 60% of Asian countries’ total trade in goods occurs within the region, facilitated by increasingly integrated Asian supply chains.
Intraregional funding and investment flows are also increasing, with more than 70% of Asian startup funding coming from within the region.
Flows of people – 74% of travel within Asia is undertaken by Asians – help to integrate the region as well.
What makes these flows work is Asia’s diversity.
In fact, there are at least four “Asias,” each at a different stage of economic development, playing a unique role in the region’s global rise.
The first Asia comprises China, the region’s anchor economy, which provides a connectivity and innovation platform to its neighbors.
In 2013-17, the country accounted for 35% of Asia’s total outward FDI, with about one-quarter of that investment going to other Asian economies.
Reflecting its rapidly growing innovation capacity, China accounted for 44% of the world’s patent applications in 2017.
The second grouping – “Advanced Asia” – also provides technology and capital.
With total outward FDI of $1 trillion, these countries accounted for 54% of total regional FDI outflows in 2013-17.
South Korea alone provided 33% of all FDI flows to Vietnam. Japan accounted for 35% of Myanmar’s FDI inflows, and 17% of the Philippines’.
Then there is “Emerging Asia,” which comprises a relatively diverse group of small emerging economies that provide not only labor, but also growth potential, owing to rising productivity and consumption.
These economies are deeply integrated with their regional neighbors: their average share of intraregional flows of goods, capital, and people is 79%, the highest of the four Asias.
By contrast, the fourth grouping – “Frontier Asia and India” – has the lowest average share of intraregional flows, amounting to just 31%.
But this figure – which reflects historic ties to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the United States – is set to increase, as these economies, which historically were less integrated, forge closer bonds with their Asian neighbors.
This group has a lot to offer, including a relatively young labor force that is capitalizing on the growing Asian import market, and a growing middle class that can serve as a new market for regional exports.
The differences among the four Asias are complementary, making integration a powerful force for progress.
For example, as one country’s labor force ages, a country with a younger population fills the gap.
The median age of India’s population stood at 27 in 2015, compared to 37 in China and 48 in Japan and is expected to reach just 38 by 2050.
Likewise, when wages – and thus manufacturing costs – begin to rise in one country, an economy at an earlier stage of development takes over its low-cost manufacturing activities.
From 2014 to 2017, when China’s share of all labor-intensive emerging-economy exports declined from 55% to 52%, Vietnam’s share increased by 2.2 percentage points and Cambodia’s by 0.4 percentage points.
For years, observers have breathlessly discussed Asia’s future potential.
The future has arrived.
We have entered the “Asian century,” as the author Parag Khanna puts it. There is no turning back.

A Black and White Question
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene.
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.
The man refused.
He was then told to identify himself.
The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him.
He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification.
The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed.
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast.
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.
That, too, would not have been unusual.
What made this case special was that Henry Louis “Skip” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country, famous for his books, his articles, and numerous television appearances.
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.
That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him.
Class and race overlap in the US.
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.
Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck.
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”
Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates.
As it happens, the charges were duly dropped, and there the case might have rested if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill, had not weighed in on behalf of his “friend” Gates, and called the police “stupid.”
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.
The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.
The field is too full of mines.
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.
And there remains plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, mostly black areas; the appalling healthcare system; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks, who don’t have the privilege of a Harvard ID.
It is probably true that many white policemen, even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city.
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?
One might argue that it was.
If not Professor Gates, then who?
Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue.
If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem, or some other poor, or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard about it.
The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin. There was no question of violence.
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.

Are the Climate Kids Right?
CAMBRIDGE – The increase of greenhouse-gas emissions (GHGs) in the atmosphere has caused average global surface temperatures to rise by almost 1°C over the past century. There is no doubt in the scientific community that these changes are a direct consequence of human activity.
Yet it seems increasingly unlikely that we will be able to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently to halt and then reverse global warming.
The costs of this failure – rising sea levels, mass population displacement, more frequent extreme weather events, and the spread of new infectious diseases – are expected to be catastrophic, even without considering the truly apocalyptic “tail risks” identified by the late Martin Weitzman of Harvard University.
And many of the costs will be borne by today’s young people.
Given this, could the “school strike for climate,” an international movement of students and youth activists, be the solution?
Yes and no.
The world – particularly the United States – needs a wake-up call.
Our false sense of comfort – encouraged by disingenuous narratives about geoengineering or other technological silver bullets – needs to be shattered.
Marshaling robust responses to massive collective challenges has always required sustained engagement by citizens and civil society.
But social transformation also requires new laws, norms, and incentives.
Without meaningful legislation, businesses and individuals will not change their ways.
And without the emergence of new norms, business will always find ways to circumvent new laws.
Legislation and norms therefore must work in tandem to establish new long-lasting incentives.
The outrage expressed by today’s young climate activists could drive a change in global norms.
But the current wave of activism will have to be translated into an organized political movement to rival the power of the fossil-fuel industry, perhaps by merging with or taking over existing Green parties.
The challenge for activists is to elevate climate concerns above all other issues, so that people will support policies to reduce GHG emissions regardless of their other economic, social, and cultural priorities.
Only then can the issue’s political center of gravity shift.
As matters stand, the current youth movement’s biggest weakness is that it lacks a coherent agenda for decarbonizing economic production.
In fact, many young activists regard markets and economic growth as part of the problem.
After all, the fossil-fuel industry has long appealed to free-market principles when lobbying against carbon taxes and regulation.
But the market could be a powerful weapon for fighting climate change.
In fact, there is no reason to think that economic growth must be a casualty of climate action.
An appropriately high carbon tax would set a predictable price for the damage that carbon-intensive economic activities inflict on humanity, thereby encouraging firms and households to shift away from carbon-emitting activities.
And by signaling that carbon is a major environmental threat, a tax would serve the dual function of encouraging normative change.
If a carbon tax is to be effective, however, it would need to be set much higher than the current rate in many countries, which is based on an implicit price of $30-50 per ton of CO2.
And even then, policymakers and climate activists will need to go further.
While a tax will encourage firms to seek cleaner energy sources, it is not a sufficiently powerful trigger for the development of alternative low-carbon technologies.
As such, carbon taxes should be supplemented with well-designed “green subsidies” to firms and researchers developing wind, solar, and geothermal technologies, and to those working on new ways to limit emissions from existing technologies.
Like carbon taxes, green subsidies harness the power of the market.
It is no coincidence that most of the major technological breakthroughs of the twentieth century – antibiotics, computer technology, the Internet, nanotechnology – came from governments guiding and creating markets.
While government-funded research and subsidies were instrumental in shaping incentives, little would have been achieved without the private sector.
To see what state support without a robust market mechanism looks like, consider the disastrous experience of the Soviet Union throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
Finally, today’s young climate activists should not presume that humanity’s future on this planet depends on stopping or severely curtailing economic growth. A transition to a low-carbon economy certainly will require sacrifices.
(Claims that a “Green New Deal” can both reduce emissions and boost employment in the short run are not credible.) But, ultimately, economic growth can benefit from well-designed green policies.
Moreover, policies to tackle climate change may not be sustainable in the absence of growth, given that economic hardship can diminish the public’s support for far-reaching reforms.
Nonetheless, the future of growth cannot rest on producing ever-more manufactured goods.
Our task is to find better, more creative, and less resource-intensive ways to meet the diverse needs of more than seven billion people.
Once the transition to a cleaner economy is accomplished, growth can continue without adding to our climate footprint.
The climate activists are right to work toward a shared understanding about the need for better ways to produce and consume energy.
But, more to the point, we need economic growth itself to continue – and not only to maintain political support for a green policy agenda.
In a world where more than one billion people still live in extreme poverty, and where billions more aspire to a higher standard of living, a realistic promise of shared growth will be far more compelling than calls for a halt to economic progress.
We owe today’s young activists a huge debt for sounding the alarm.
Now, we need to turn their enthusiasm into an institutionalized political force, and develop a blueprint for a potent, well-designed, and productive economic agenda.
Markets need not stand in our way. On the contrary, they could be a powerful ally.

China’s India Land Grab
NEW DELHI – Stoking tensions with Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines over islands in the South and East China Seas has not prevented an increasingly assertive China from opening yet another front by staging a military incursion across the disputed, forbidding Himalayan frontier.
On the night of April 15, a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) platoon stealthily intruded near the China-India-Pakistan tri-junction, established a camp 19 kilometers (12 miles) inside Indian-controlled territory, and presented India’s government with the potential loss of a strategically vital 750-square-kilometer high-altitude plateau.
A stunned India, already reeling under a crippling domestic political crisis, has groped for an effective response to China’s land-grab – the largest and most strategic real estate China has seized since it began pursuing a more muscular policy toward its neighbors.
Whether China intends to stay put by building permanent structures for its troops on the plateau’s icy heights, or plans to withdraw after having extracted humiliating military concessions from India, remains an open – and in some ways a moot – question.
The fact is that, with its “peaceful rise” giving way to an increasingly sharp-elbowed approach to its neighbors, China has broadened its “core interests” – which brook no compromise – and territorial claims, while showing a growing readiness to take risks to achieve its goals.
For example, China has not only escalated its challenge to Japan’s decades-old control of the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, but is also facing off against the Philippines since taking effective control of Scarborough Shoal last year.
What makes the Himalayan incursion a powerful symbol of China’s aggressive new stance in Asia is that its intruding troops have set up camp in an area that extends beyond the “line of actual control” (LAC) that China itself unilaterally drew when it defeated India in the 1962 Chinese-initiated border war.
While China’s navy and a part of its air force focus on supporting revanchist territorial and maritime claims in the South and East China Seas, its army has been active in the mountainous borderlands with India, trying to alter the LAC bit by bit.
One of the novel methods that the PLA has employed is to bring ethnic Han pastoralists to the valleys along the LAC and give them cover to range across it, in the process driving Indian herdsmen from their traditional pasturelands.
But the latest crisis was sparked by China’s use of direct military means in a strategic border area close to the Karakoram Pass linking China to India.
Because the LAC has not been mutually clarified – China reneged on a 2001 promise to exchange maps with India – China claims that PLA troops are merely camping on “Chinese land.”
Yet, in a replay of its old strategy of furtively encroaching on disputed land and then presenting itself as the conciliator, China now counsels “patience” and “negotiations” to help resolve the latest “issue.”
China is clearly seeking to exploit India’s political disarray to alter the reality on the ground.
A paralyzed and rudderless Indian government initially blacked out reporting on the incursion, lest it come under public pressure to mount a robust response.
Its first public statement came only after China issued a bland denial of the intrusion in response to Indian media reports quoting army sources.
To add to India’s woes, Salman Khurshid, the country’s bungling foreign minister, initially made light of the deepest Chinese incursion in more than a quarter-century.
The garrulous minister called the intrusion just “one little spot” of acne on the otherwise “beautiful face” of the bilateral relationship – a mere blemish that could be treated with “an ointment.”
Those inept comments fatally undercut the government’s summoning of the Chinese ambassador to demand a return to the status quo ante.
With Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s corruption-tainted government tottering on the brink of collapse, there has been no official explanation of how India was caught napping in a militarily critical area where, in the recent past, China had made repeated attempts to encroach on Indian land.
In fact, the government inexplicably replaced regular army troops with border police in 2010 to patrol the mountain-ringed plateau into which the PLA has now intruded.
Known as Depsang, the plateau lies astride an ancient silk route connecting Yarkand in Xinjiang to India’s Ladakh region through the Karakoram Pass.
India, with a military staging post and airstrip just south of the Karakoram Pass, has the capacity to cut off the highway linking China with its “all-weather ally,” Pakistan.
The PLA intrusion, by threatening that Indian base, may have been intended to foreclose India’s ability to choke off supplies to Chinese troops and workers in Pakistan’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, where China has expanded its military footprint and strategic projects.
To guard those projects, several thousand Chinese troops reportedly have been deployed in the rebellious, predominantly Shia region, which is closed to the outside world.
For India, the Chinese incursion also threatens its access to the 6,300-meter-high Siachen Glacier, to the west of Depsang.
Pakistan claims the Indian-controlled glacier, which, strategically wedged between the Pakistani- and Chinese-held parts of Kashmir, served as the world’s highest and coldest battleground (and one of the bloodiest) from the mid-1980’s until a cease-fire took effect in 2003.
India’s nonmilitary options to force a Chinese withdrawal from Depsang range from diplomatic (suspension of all official visits or reconsideration of its recognition of Tibet as part of China) to economic (an informal boycott of Chinese goods, just as China has hurt Japan through a nonofficial boycott of Japanese-made products).
A possible military response could involve the Indian army establishing a camp of its own on Chinese territory elsewhere that China’s leaders regard as highly strategic.
But, before it can exercise any option credibly, India needs a stable government.
Until then, China will continue to press its claims by whatever means – fair or foul – it deems advantageous.

A False Alarm About China
MANILA – To hear some pundits tell it, China’s economic miracle – one that lifted 300 million people out of poverty and shifted the world’s geopolitical center of gravity – is coming to a tumultuous end.
The volatile stock market and the renminbi’s “surprise” depreciation are signs of imminent economic collapse, according to this view, as risky investments and high levels of government debt put the brakes on decades of turbo-charged output growth.
Fortunately, there is little reason to believe such dire predictions, or that the market gyrations that have been driving recent headlines represent anything more than short-term volatility.
After all, equity-price movements are a poor predictor of the real economy’s performance.
Indeed, when Chinese GDP was growing strongly during 2010-2013, stock prices were falling.
More recently, when stock prices began soaring during the first half of 2015, the economy’s slowdown had already begun.
As the American economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped, “The stock market has called nine of the last five recessions.”
China’s growth has slowed largely as a result of changes in its fundamentals: less favorable demographics, a shift in emphasis from exports and public investment to the service sector and domestic consumption, and lower demand from advanced economies.
But China’s past success also contributed to this slowdown, in the form of higher wages, which narrow the scope for rapid growth based on low-cost labor and technological catch-up.
Additional signs of weakness, including soft data on exports and investment, emerged in the first half of 2015.
But other important indicators – like retail sales and housing – show upticks.
And, perhaps most important, the country’s labor market remains healthy, creating some 7.2 million new urban jobs – many of them in services – in the first half of 2015.
Meanwhile, wage growth remains strong and uninterrupted.
China’s growth rate may be lower than 7% this year, but I do not believe that it will end up very far from the government’s target of “about 7%.”
The volatility in equity prices in recent months has more to do with the peculiarities of China’s stock markets than with the country’s underlying economic fundamentals.
In more developed economies, such as the United States and Europe, many institutional investors – who tend to be focused on long-term fundamentals – help stabilize stock markets.
By contrast, the Chinese markets are dominated by retail investors, who are more likely to pursue short-term gains and engage in momentum trading, thereby exacerbating volatility and creating a greater disconnect between equity prices and real economic growth.
Moreover, the firms listed on China’s stock exchanges are not representative of the country’s companies.
Majority state-owned firms account for two-thirds of the market value of the country’s exchanges, for example, though they are responsible for no more than one-third of Chinese GDP and an even smaller share of employment.
The rise and fall of the Chinese stock market should also be understood in the context of Chinese households’ limited options for storing savings.
The run-up in prices took place at a time when deposit interest rates were officially capped.
When the alternatives are few and provide only low returns, the equity market looks more attractive, especially if – as was the case – the country’s major newspapers are running bullish editorials about stock prices.
More recent developments may have contributed to the downward pressure on prices, including discussion about abolishing interest-rate ceilings on deposits (the cap on term deposits of one year or more was removed on August 25).
The greater ease with which wealthy households can move savings out of the country, along with an anticipated increase in interest rates in the United States, was likely another contributing factor.
Furthermore, as Harvard’s Jeffrey Frankel has pointed out, regulators increased margin requirements several times this year, making it harder to buy stocks with borrowed money.
And, as with all stock markets, shifts in sentiment that are not connected to fundamentals can also drive volatility.
Whether China’s economy can continue to grow rapidly will depend far more on its ability to reform than on how its stock markets perform.
If China is to thrive in the long term, raising its aggregate productivity is key.
This means that it will need to overhaul its state-owned firms and the financial sector so that resources can flow to the most productive investment projects.
Lowering the tax burden on firms – including the payroll tax – would also be useful.
Reforms that increase the flexibility of the labor market are also in order.
While China used to have a relatively flexible labor market in the manufacturing sector, firms’ reallocation of workers based on market needs has become more difficult in recent years.
Greater flexibility might not stimulate short-term growth, but it would improve resilience to future negative shocks, whether they originate at home or abroad.
As long as China continues to pursue pro-market reforms, it will remain the largest single-country contributor to global GDP growth over the medium term – unperturbed by stock-market volatility.
If reforms stall, falling stock prices are likely to be the least of China’s worries.

Why the EU Election Was a Win for Macron
PARIS – Though the final vote tally might seem to suggest otherwise, the European Parliament elections were a strategic success for French President Emmanuel Macron. There are four reasons why this is so.
First, Macron succeeded in framing the election as a contest between progressives and populists.
Though he has been assailed at home in recent months – including by some on his own “side” – it is worth remembering that this message did not emerge out of thin air.
Rather, it harks back to Macron’s 2017 presidential campaign, which itself tapped into a broader political sea change taking place across Europe.
In that election, he overcame the traditional right-left divide.
Two years later, this was replicated in the European Parliament elections.
Historically, the Republicans on the right and the Socialists on the left have dominated French politics.
Yet these parties’ combined share of the popular vote was under 15%, whereas Macron’s La République en Marche ! won 22.4%, and the far-right National Rally (formerly the National Front) picked up 23.3%.
Behind these figures is an unprecedented collapse of the mainstream French right, which has failed to reconcile identity politics with traditional liberalism.
Though some French conservatives have migrated to the National Rally, much of the center-right electorate has gravitated toward Macron’s party, owing to efforts by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe (formerly of the Republicans).
Moreover, most of those who switched to La République en Marche ! are pensioners who did so despite being hit hard by Macron’s tax reforms (some of which have been reversed).
This suggests that Macron’s progressive-versus-populist narrative helped to re-mobilize France’s – and perhaps Europe’s – pro-European electorate.
While the National Rally performed well and Italy’s right-wing League party made gains, they failed to trigger the EU-wide political earthquake that many had come to expect.
The second reason the election represents a victory for Macron is that his party will now be able to claim leadership over a pivotal centrist parliamentary group of 110 members.
The relative losses suffered by the European People’s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), combined with the surge in support for the Greens, means that the European Parliament is entering a period of quadripartite governance.
Provided these groups are able to compromise, the new arrangement will probably be an improvement on the old one, wherein the EPP and S&D divvied up all of the jobs.
For the first time in the European Parliament’s history, the number of MEPs affiliated with the two main parties represents only 44% of the total.
A more fluid parliamentary composition will allow for more ad hoc majorities to emerge in support of various policy proposals, given that there is so much common ground between La République en Marche !, the S&D, and the Greens.
And, as an added bonus, the end of the EPP/S&D duopoly also marks the end of German hegemony in the Parliament.
Third, the Spitzenkandidaten process – whereby the largest party grouping selects the president of the European Commission – is likely to collapse, and this may also work to Macron’s advantage.
The system is a first-past-the-post mechanism in a proportionally elected Parliament, and has more to do with partisanship than with democracy, because it gives automatic power to the largest group.
But while the EPP won the most parliamentary seats, its Spitzenkandidat, Manfred Weber, is very controversial.
Just before the election, he was weakened by the political demise of Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose government was brought down by the release of a video in which his vice chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache of the Freedom Party, appears to offer a quid pro quo for electoral help from Russia.
But Merkel still defends Weber, and, apart from Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, most EU leaders are reluctant to confront the European Parliament on the Spitzenkandidaten issue.
That may shorten the odds for Margrethe Vestager – who is not from the EPP, but who is, in a sense, a liberal Spitzenkandidat – while lengthening them for Michel Barnier, who is from the EPP but is not a Spitzenkandidat.
If the Council succeeds in ruling out Weber and his populist supporters, Macron will claim it as a success.
Finally, the election provides a check on German hegemony within the EU more broadly.
Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has been weakened, and the country’s Greens have grown stronger.
For his part, Macron will find the Greens much easier to work with on eurozone reform, especially if they end up joining a new German coalition government.
Taken together, these post-election considerations paint a rather positive picture for Macron.
The question now is whether he can use his strength at the EU level to shore up his domestic position.
This will not happen automatically.
With the fall of the French right, there may be a temptation to position La République en Marche ! as a new home for right-wing French voters.
But while this might capture Paris’s bourgeois 16th arrondissement, doing so would be a mistake.
Instead, Macron should focus on securing more of the atomized left, particularly those who have moved to the National Rally.
As matters stand, La République en Marche !’s base remains limited to the “winners” of globalization.
Rural, alienated, and economically vulnerable voters remain in the National Rally’s camp.
To win them over, Macron must reduce the polarization between the two parties.

Living on a Volcano
As I write this, violent clashes with the police have been going on for nearly two weeks in the suburbs of Paris and other French cities, with cars being set on fire at a rate of nearly 1,000 per night.
Why is this happening?
How far can it go?
The existence of thousands of unemployed young people, without income or roots, idle and knowing only violence to express their quest for recognition, is not particularly French.
Everyone remembers the Watts, Newark, and Detroit riots in the United States in the 1960’s, and the riots in Liverpool in the UK in the early 1980’s, as well as in Bradford, Oldham, and Burnley in recent years.
Likewise, France witnessed riots in Vaux-en-Velin, near Lyon, 20 years ago.
So it is important to distinguish what is common to many developed countries and what is specific to France.
All the developed economies have undergone profound changes over the last 30 years.
We have gone from managerial to stockowner capitalism, from economies with large doses of state direction to far more deregulated markets, from the active and expansive social policies of the 1960s’ and 1970’s to a world in which such spending is constantly shrinking.
Although wealth has been growing constantly – GDP has more than doubled in the last 50 years – the share of wages in the total has diminished by 10%, even while millions of the rich have become much richer.
Everywhere, this has meant massive pauperization of the least favored part of the population. In rich countries, mass poverty, which seemed to have been eliminated around 1980, has reappeared.
Access to good education, and even more so to the labor market, is increasingly restricted for many young people, especially those who come from poor or single-parent families or from minority ethnic backgrounds, languages, or religions.
These people feel rejected and unrecognized.
“Because they want to break us, we will break everything” is the motto that best expresses their mood.
There are untold reservoirs of social violence in all of our lands.
But against this shared background, France exhibits some important distinctive features.
First, demography: for the last 50 years France has had much higher fertility rates than the rest of Europe – 1.9 children per woman, compared to the European average of 1.6 and the German or Spanish rates of 1.3.
In Germany, every generation entering the labor market is smaller than the one exiting it.
In France, by contrast, 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation – and this does not include immigration, which, although slowing recently, represents a large number of job seekers.
As rates of economic growth have declined, this has meant growing unemployment.
Then there is geography: France’s massive urban concentration around the capital – Paris and its suburbs contain nearly 20% of the population – is unique in Europe.
The sheer number of confused and disoriented young people has overwhelmed the French system’s capacity to integrate them – even though its capacity in this regard is, in fact, impressive.
Indeed, France has opened its public educational system to an extraordinary degree, refusing all group rights to minorities, but vigorously affirming personal rights, including full access to all social services, regardless of language, religion, or skin color.
The system is cracking, but only because of the limits of its absorptive capacity, not because of its core principles.
In these circumstances, every French politician has known for the last 20 years that France has been living with a growing risk that isolated incidents might coalesce into a critical mass of violence.
The task of social workers and police, therefore, is to try to resolve – quickly and discreetly – each particular incident, in order to dampen the revolt.
What needs to be done also has been well known since 20 years ago, when a nonpartisan report by a cross-party group of big-city mayors unanimously agreed on measures to be taken: efficient repression, highly developed social prevention, a permanent local police presence, and a renewed effort at reintegrating delinquents.
The difficulty with implementing this policy has been that its preventive aspects – social support and reintegration of delinquents – appear to the frightened population living in the affected areas as being “soft on crime” and overly generous.
But for the past three years, France has had a government that no longer believes that a socially oriented urban policy works.
It believes only in repression and says so openly.
As a result, local police forces have been reduced from 20,000 to 11,000, while the national riot police (CRS) have been reinforced.
France is now experiencing a practical demonstration of this insane and totally inefficient policy, with the Minister of the Interior, Nicolas Sarkozy, providing a telling illustration of the new orientation when he described the rebellious young as “scum.”
It was the proverbial match thrown by a careless smoker into a parched forest.
The young responded with a vengeance to Sarkozy’s provocation.
The main risk now is that events in the suburbs of large French cities will serve as an example to other young people, whether in the less urban areas of France or in other European countries, who feel socially excluded and are, perhaps, just as prone to violent outbursts.
Solving the problems underlying the French revolt will require time, discretion, mutual respect, community-based social and police work – rather than a centralized, repressive approach – and a lot of money.
But France is by no means the only country that should be worried.

Pakistan’s Winnable War on Polio
LAHORE – I grew up in Pakistan throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s, and my parents, like parents everywhere, wanted me to be fit and healthy and to get the best start in life.
I was lucky enough to be brought up in a middle-class family with good sanitation facilities and clean water.
I was also given vaccines to prevent life-threatening infections such as polio and measles.
But I remember the many children in my neighborhood who were not vaccinated.
Those early experiences of children I knew contracting disease, especially the poliovirus that is so visibly impairing, shaped my views on the immense value of good health and the power of vaccines.
I live in London now, but my roots will always be in Pakistan.
As head of the British Pakistan Foundation, I help philanthropists from the Pakistani diaspora invest in sustainable and effective social development projects.
Over the last few weeks, I have been in my hometown of Lahore, the country’s second-largest city, discussing everything from the upcoming elections to everyday life challenges.
Last week, I visited an orphanage on the outskirts of the city, set up after the 2005 earthquake that killed an estimated 75,000 people. I was impressed and encouraged that roughly four-fifths of the 85 children were fully vaccinated.
National statistics on immunization back up the positive signs that I saw.
In 1994, Pakistan had roughly 25,000 cases of polio, many resulting in death or permanent disability. But, thanks to intensive vaccination campaigns, there were only 58 cases of polio in the entire country last year – down 70% from 2011.
And the government and international health officials have agreed on a plan to stop polio transmission in Pakistan completely by the end of 2014 – a historic accomplishment that would be a huge source of national pride.
The main driver of Pakistan’s dramatic reduction in polio cases over the last two decades has been leadership at all levels.
In 1994, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto launched the first national vaccination drive by inoculating her baby daughter, Aseefa.
Nineteen years later, Aseefa is Pakistan’s Goodwill Ambassador on Polio Eradication and a powerful advocate of completing her mother’s dream of a polio-free country.
International public-private partnerships and an army of vaccinators are working on the frontlines to protect every last child.
Collectively, we are helping children and communities once considered unreachable.
With the recent progress on polio, Pakistan has a blueprint for future public-health interventions.
In fact, we are already seeing the new framework take shape.
For example, vitamin A drops – which provide infants with an essential micronutrient for vision and healthy growth – are now delivered twice yearly in conjunction with polio vaccines.
Moreover, last year Pakistan became the first country in the region to introduce the latest vaccine to protect children against pneumonia.
With pneumonia accounting for a shockingly high 20% of child deaths each year in Pakistan, widespread access to the new vaccine should have a major impact.
Major challenges remain.
According to UNICEF, Pakistan has the second-highest rate of child mortality in South Asia.
There is an important debate taking place in our country about how best to organize the health-care system so that it is accountable for serving the poorest and most marginalized communities.
The size of the challenges that we face was made clear at the beginning of this year, when a measles outbreak killed more than 300 children in Pakistan – most of whom had not received vaccines.
Just this month, we learned the tragic news that a guard accompanying health workers was killed during an immunization drive.
But we will not be deterred.
Those who advocate violence are a minority in Pakistan, and will not stand in the way of our people’s betterment.
With the upcoming elections, we have a valuable opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to vaccines by strengthening national leadership on health and increasing investment in the health-care system.
And, as I heard from the guardians at the orphanage, educating communities about the value of vaccines and mobilizing their support is critical for reaching every last child.
The cooperation of the Pakistani diaspora movement and international donors like the Islamic Development Bank (which in March signed a financing package of $227 million to fight polio in Pakistan), together with the vaccinators’ determination to reach all of the country’s children, is inspirational.
It is also changing lives for the better.
With continued support for vital vaccines from Pakistan’s government and people, I am hopeful that the next time I return home, there will be even more reasons to be optimistic about our children’s future.

Work in an Automated Future
LONDON – Disruptive technologies are now dictating our future, as new innovations increasingly blur the lines between physical, digital, and biological realms.
Robots are already in our operating rooms and fast-food restaurants; we can now use 3D imaging and stem-cell extraction to grow human bones from a patient’s own cells; and 3D printing is creating a circular economy in which we can use and then reuse raw materials.
This tsunami of technological innovation will continue to change profoundly how we live and work, and how our societies operate.
In what is now called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, technologies that are coming of age – including robotics, nanotechnology, virtual reality, 3D printing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and advanced biology – will converge.
And as these technologies continue to be developed and widely adopted, they will bring about radical shifts in all disciplines, industries, and economies, and in the way that individuals, companies, and societies produce, distribute, consume, and dispose of goods and services.
These developments have provoked anxious questions about what role humans will play in a technology-driven world.
A 2013 University of Oxford study estimates that close to half of all jobs in the United States could be lost to automation over the next two decades.
On the other hand, economists such as Boston University’s James Bessen argue that automation often goes hand in hand with the creation of new jobs.
So which is it – new jobs or massive structural unemployment?
At this point, we can be certain that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have a disruptive impact on employment, but no one can yet predict the scale of change.
So, before we swallow all of the bad news, we should look at history, which suggests that technological change more often affects the nature of work, rather than the opportunity to participate in work itself.
The First Industrial Revolution moved British manufacturing from people’s homes into factories, and marked the beginning of hierarchical organization.
This change was often violent, as the famous early-nineteenth-century Luddite riots in England demonstrated.
To find work, people were forced to move from rural areas to industrial centers, and it was during this period that the first labor movements emerged.
The Second Industrial Revolution ushered in electrification, large-scale production, and new transportation and communication networks, and created new professions such as engineering, banking, and teaching.
This is when middle classes emerged and began to demand new social policies and an increased role for government.
During the Third Industrial Revolution, modes of production were further automated by electronics and by information and communication technology, with many human jobs moving from manufacturing into services.
When automated teller machines (ATMs) arrived in the 1970s, it was initially assumed that they would be a disaster for workers in retail banking.
And yet the number of bank branch jobs actually increased over time as costs fell.
The nature of the job had changed: it became less transactional and more focused on customer service.
Disruption accompanied each previous industrial revolution, and the fourth will be no different.
But if we keep in mind the lessons of history, we can manage the change.
For starters, we need to focus on skills, and not just on the specific jobs that will appear or disappear.
If we determine which skill sets we will need, we can educate and train the human workforce to leverage all of the new opportunities that technology creates.
Human-resources departments, educational institutions, and governments should lead the charge on this effort.
Second, past experience has repeatedly shown that disadvantaged classes must be protected; workers who are vulnerable to being displaced by technology must have the time and means to adjust.
As we saw in 2016, there can be far-reaching consequences when vast inequalities of opportunities and outcomes lead people to believe that they have no future.
Last but not least, to ensure that the Fourth Industrial Revolution translates into economic growth and bears fruit for all, we must work together to create new regulatory ecosystems.
Governments will have a crucial role to play, but business and civil-society leaders will also need to collaborate with governments to determine the appropriate regulations and standards for new technologies and industries.
I am under no illusions that this will be easy.
Politics, not technology, will determine the pace of change, and implementing the necessary reforms will be hard, slow work, particularly in democracies.
It will require a mix of forward-looking policymaking, agile regulatory frameworks, and, above all, effective partnerships across organizational and national boundaries.
A good model to keep in mind is Denmark’s “flexicurity” system, in which a flexible labor market is paired with a strong social safety net that includes training and re-skilling services for all citizens.
Technology may be advancing rapidly, but it will not cause time itself to collapse.
The momentous – indeed, revolutionary – changes ahead will take place over many decades, not as a big bang.
Individuals, companies, and societies do have time to adjust; but there is no time for delay.
Creating a future in which all can benefit must start now.

Central Asia’s Afghan Route to Prosperity
BISHKEK – For the first time in centuries, there is an opportunity to connect Central and South Asia via modern transport and energy corridors through Afghanistan.
Once completed, these projects would transform Eurasian security, significantly increase regional economic activity, and potentially bring peace at last to Afghanistan.
They may even revive the Great Silk Road.
Progress on the planned schemes should therefore interest the region’s influential neighbors – Russia, China, and India – and the United States, which has spent at least $2 trillion in Afghanistan over the last 20 years.
But most of the world regards Central Asia as terra incognita, and has so far paid little attention to significant recent developments.
In February, for example, Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov visited three Central Asian countries – Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan – to secure their support for transport projects with Afghanistan and South Asian countries.
Kamilov was traveling at the behest of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who, in his December 29 message to the country’s parliament, highlighted cooperation with South Asia and promotion of peace in Afghanistan as his main regional priorities.
Specifically, the talks were about construction of the “Kabul Corridor” railway from Termez in Uzbekistan to the Pakistani city of Peshawar via Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul in Afghanistan.
The railway could transport up to 20 million tons of cargo per year, and the section from Termez to Mazar-i-Sharif, built by Uzbekistan, is already operational.
The remaining 573-kilometer (356-mile) stretch to Peshawar will have to cross the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the passes are more than 3,500 meters (11,483 feet) above sea level, making it one of the world’s highest mountain railways.
The section of the railway from Mazar-i-Sharif to Kabul, at a preliminary estimated cost of $5 billion, will be built mainly with borrowed funds.
In late December, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan jointly appealed to international financial institutions to support the project.
Subject to financing, construction could begin in September this year.
The existing highway between Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul will ensure the delivery of equipment and construction materials, while Uzbekistan and Tajikistan’s power lines to the Afghan capital run along the same route, making it possible to electrify the rail link.
In Peshawar, the railway will connect arriving trains with the Pakistani transport system, thereby linking the Central Asian and Eurasian railway networks to those of South Asia and providing access to the Pakistani ports of Karachi, Qasim, and Gwadar.
It is estimated that the new railway will reduce goods transportation times from Central Asia to Pakistan from 30 days to 15 and cut transportation costs by 30-35%.
The apparent reason for giving access to Pakistani ports priority over other options is that the Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar route is the shortest one.
But there is a more important one: the Kabul Corridor, together with the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan transport corridor, will connect four economically powerful Eurasian regions – Europe, China, Russia, and South Asia – via Central Asia.
Today, the main transport route from Central Asia to the southern seas, through the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, is no longer considered the most attractive.
Economists calculate that transporting a container from Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, to Karachi would cost approximately $1,400-1,600, about half the price of transporting it from Tashkent to Bandar Abbas ($2,600-3,000).
Besides, international economic sanctions against Iran will complicate any projects there.
At the end of 2020, construction began on the Afghan section of another mega-project linking Central and South Asia: the TAPI gas pipeline, named after the four countries through which it will pass – Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The 1,814-kilometer pipeline will run from the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan to the Indian city of Fazilka via Herat and Kandahar in Afghanistan and the Pakistani cities of Quetta and Multan.
It will have a capacity of 33 billion cubic meters of gas per year and cost an estimated $8-10 billion.
Although security concerns have long cast doubt on the TAPI pipeline’s viability, completion is now scheduled for December 2023.
Crucially, a high-ranking Taliban delegation visited Turkmenistan on February 6, promising to support the project.
There are indications that the US, which has long backed the pipeline, may have facilitated the trip.
Central Asia has always been a politically sensitive region, part of what former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski called the “grand chessboard.”
When implementing such large projects, therefore, one should consider the geopolitical positions of major regional players such as America, Russia, and China.
But for now at least, it appears that everyone has an interest in Central Asia and Afghanistan being economically dynamic and politically stable, rather than poor and a source of conflict.
For all the importance of new landmark projects, further Central Asian cooperation is essential.
Historically, the region has prospered most when it acts as a “crossroads civilization,” channeling and transforming Eurasian trade, and economic and cultural forces.
In fact, Central Asia became a world leader in economic development, trade, technology, manufacturing, and intellectual life during the period referred to as its golden age, when it was open, dynamic, and willing and able to learn and adapt from others.
There is no reason why Central Asia cannot succeed again.
Practicing a form of open regionalism, Central Asians found many reasons to cooperate over several centuries.
A return to that role would be good news for the entire world – and deserving of its leaders’ attention.

Renewing the South Korean Miracle
SEOUL – South Korea’s incoming president, Park Geun-hye, takes over a country that has been a global role model for economic development.
But, with the economy slowing, it has become a model in need of renewal.
The so-called “Miracle on the Han River” took root with the reforms initiated by Park’s late father Park Chung-hee, the country’s ruler for much of the 1960’s and 1970’s.
A measure of South Korea’s success is that it was the first country to make the transition from being a recipient of OECD aid to becoming a donor, with per capita GDP today exceeding $30,000 (in purchasing power parity terms).
But the growth formula that long underpinned South Korea’s success – a form of state-guided capitalism that focuses on export-led manufacturing – is no longer working for many South Koreans.
GDP has nearly tripled over the past 20 years, but, with real wages rising at less than half this rate, growth has become decoupled from the fate of ordinary citizens.
More than half of middle-income households spend more each month than they earn.
The signs of social distress are multiplying.
South Korea’s divorce rate has doubled, fertility rates have fallen to the fourth lowest among advanced economies, and the suicide rate is the highest in the OECD.
South Korea is troubled for two key reasons. First, although some parts of the economy reached advanced industrialization in record time, other parts (and institutions) are struggling to catch up.
Manufacturing conglomerates such as Hyundai, LG, and Samsung have morphed into highly productive global giants whose growth creates fewer high-quality jobs at home than before.
Employment at the country’s largest companies is falling, and the share of South Korean jobs at such companies has dropped by one-third since 1995.
But South Korea does not have a well-developed service sector to provide a new source of high-paying jobs.
Worse, service industries are falling further behind large manufacturers in terms of productivity and wages.
This leads to the second challenge: the dire financial straits of middle-income households.
Many families now face stagnating wages, owing to the kinds of jobs now available, but are determined to cling to a lifestyle that they can no longer afford.
Families with children are engaged in an escalating “educational arms race,” devoting large shares of their income to private education and tutoring to prepare children for entrance to elite universities and a shot at a secure job at a major corporation.
Middle-income families also insist on buying homes, despite the highest multiple of home price to income among advanced economies and a housing-finance system that imposes high borrowing costs.
South Korean women still drop out of the labor force when they marry or have children; only 38% of families have two wage earners (half the OECD average).
One of the most pernicious effects of the squeeze on middle-income households and the cost of the educational arms race is a voluntary one-child policy that has reduced the country’s fertility rate to 1.2 births per woman, among the lowest in the industrialized world.
The population is aging at an accelerating rate, and the net flow of working-age citizens into the labor force has turned negative.
Without action, the economy faces the threat of declining consumption and even shrinking output.
South Korea badly needs measures to relieve the stresses on middle-income finances and a new growth formula based on a globally competitive service sector and entrepreneurial small and medium-size (SME) businesses that create well-paying jobs.
Major reforms are necessary to help middle-income families escape crushing monthly payments for housing and education.
Housing payments are higher because mortgages are of short duration (an average of ten years) and tight loan-to-value restrictions force borrowers to seek additional higher-cost loans from second-tier deposit institutions and non-financial companies.
These conditions need to change.
Because banks would need to accept higher risk, a secondary market for mortgages is necessary.
Policymakers should also consider measures to reduce demand for home ownership, including relaxing regulations on investment by insurance and other companies in residential housing, thereby creating better rental choices for middle-income households.
South Korea also needs to improve its public schools, particularly at the secondary level, and significantly upgrade vocational training.
Families invest in private education because they fear that the public education system will not get their children into elite universities and good jobs.
“Meister” high schools, introduced in 2010 specifically to prepare young people for high-skilled jobs, are a positive step.
Aggressive development of services – such as transport, retail, and restaurants, which today are dominated by low-productivity, low-paying local businesses, many run by sole proprietors – is another imperative.
South Korea has excellent opportunities to build up health-care services and to compete in the global medical-tourism business.
Other tourism, too, can expand to take fuller advantage of cultural and sports attractions.
In financial services, the government should aim to produce 3-4 regional champions.
Finally, Koreans must relearn the entrepreneurialism that built the chaebol, the family-owned industrial conglomerates that powered the economy’s development.
Today, South Korea has many small, family-owned businesses, but few entrepreneurs.
Fostering a more dynamic, innovative SME sector that will produce tomorrow’s globally competitive large companies requires removing disincentives to growth, such as the inheritance-tax exemption for family-owned businesses, which rewards owners for keeping their businesses small.
A bankruptcy system that allows entrepreneurs to survive the inevitable failures that accompany innovation, as well as stronger protection of intellectual property and improved access to equity finance, are also needed.
Park takes over at a pivotal point in South Korea’s history.
The new government needs to take the pragmatic steps that can overcome the limitations of today’s economic model and save the country from declining growth, higher unemployment, and rising inequality.
The task is no less than to achieve South Korea’s second miracle on the Han River.

China Confronts the Market
CAMBRIDGE – China’s current economic woes have largely been viewed through a single lens: the government’s failure to let the market operate.
But that perspective has led foreign observers to misinterpret some of this year’s most important developments in the foreign-exchange and stock markets.
To be sure, Chinese authorities do intervene strongly in various ways.
From 2004 to 2013, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) bought trillions of dollars in foreign-exchange reserves, thereby preventing the renminbi from appreciating as much as it would have had it floated freely.
More recently, the authorities have been deploying every piece of policy artillery they can muster in a vain attempt to moderate this summer’s plunge in equity prices.
But some important developments that foreigners decry as the result of government intervention are in fact the opposite.
Exhibit A is the August 11 devaluation of the renminbi against the dollar – a move that invoked for US politicians the old adage, “Be careful what you wish for.”
The devaluation – by a mere 3%, it should be noted – reflected a change in PBOC policy intended to give the market more influence over the exchange rate.
Previously, the PBOC allowed the renminbi’s value to fluctuate each day within a 2% band, but did not routinely allow the movements to cumulate from one day to the next.
Now, each day’s closing exchange rate will influence the following day’s rate, implying adjustment toward market levels.
The authorities probably would not have moved when they did had it not been for growing market pressure for a depreciation that could help counteract weakening economic growth.
In fact, bolstering growth might have been the primary motivation for the country’s political leaders, even as the PBOC remained focused on advancing the longer-term objective of strengthening the market’s role in determining the exchange rate.
But the two motivations are consistent: market forces would not be placing downward pressure on the renminbi if China’s economic fundamentals did not warrant it.
The American politicians who demanded that China float its currency may have anticipated a different outcome – somewhat unreasonably, given that market forces reversed direction in mid-2014 – but one can hardly blame the Chinese for taking them at their word.
To be sure, China remains far from embracing a free-floating currency, let alone a fully convertible one, which would require further liberalization of controls on cross-border financial flows.
Unification of onshore and offshore markets is more important than a floating exchange rate in determining whether the International Monetary Fund will include the renminbi in the basket of currencies used to determine the value of its reserve asset, the Special Drawing Right.
Much commentary on the subject has underestimated the importance of the criterion that the currency be “freely usable.”
Nonetheless, many are fretting that China’s exchange-rate adjustment has triggered a “currency war,” with other emerging economies devaluing as well.
But, more than a year after the economic fundamentals swung against emerging markets (and especially away from commodities) and toward the United States, this adjustment was due.
Though the Chinese move likely influenced the timing, other devaluations would have inevitably taken place.
Warnings about competitive devaluations are misleading.
Exhibit B in the case against attributing financial developments in China to government intervention is the stock-market bubble that culminated in June.
According to the conventional wisdom, the authorities consistently intervened not only to try to boost the market after the collapse, but also during its year-long run-up, when the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index more than doubled.
The finger-wagging implication is that Chinese policymakers, particularly the stock-market regulator, have only themselves to blame for the bubble.
There is undoubtedly some truth to this story.
It seems clear that the extraordinary run-up in equity prices was fueled by a surge in margin financing of stock purchases, which was legalized in 2010-2011 and encouraged by the PBOC’s monetary easing since last November.
Likewise, there was plenty of support for the bull market in government-sponsored news media, for example.
But what many commentators fail to note is that China’s regulatory authorities took action to try to dampen prices over the last six months of the run-up.
They tightened margin requirements in January, and again in April, when they also facilitated short-selling by expanding the number of eligible stocks.
The event that ultimately seems to have pricked the bubble was the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s June 12 announcement of plans to limit the amount that brokerages could lend for stock trading.
This is precisely the kind of counter-cyclical macroprudential policy that economists often recommend.
But, whereas advanced economies rarely implement this advice, China and many other developing countries do tend to adjust regulation, including reserve requirements for banks and ceilings on homebuyers’ borrowing, counter-cyclically.
One could criticize the Chinese regulator on the grounds that the effect of its moves to increase margin requirements did not last long; or one could criticize it on the grounds that its moves caused the recent crash.
But, either way, these measures were intended to stem the rise in market prices, rather than to contribute to it.
This is not a trivial point.
Nor is the fact that the PBOC’s interventions in the foreign-exchange market over the last year have aimed to dampen the renminbi’s depreciation, not add to it.
Given this, it is facile to blame China’s problems on government intervention.

Asian Cities’ Endless Summer
POTSDAM/MANILA – It’s monsoon season in Asia – marking an end to months of scorching temperatures.
But the extreme heat will return, with cities facing particularly brutal conditions.
Already, Asia’s urban areas experience twice as many hot days as its rural areas do – and could experience ten times as many by 2100.
At that point, there will be no reversing the trend.
The first detailed assessment of climate risk for Asia, carried out by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), makes clear that Asia’s cities stand at the frontline of the fight against climate change.
Indeed, many consequences of a hotter planet – such as more extreme weather events, sea-level rise, environmental migration, and mounting social tensions – intersect in urban areas.
This is particularly true in Asia, where cities house more than half of the population and produce almost 80% of economic output.
By 2050, Asia’s urban population could nearly double, to three billion people.
Without new climate initiatives, the region’s cities could contribute more than half of the increase in global greenhouse-gas emissions over the next 20 years.
Such a scenario is often called “business as usual.”
Yet, in reality, it is business as usual that would be disrupted by the consequences of climate change, with unfettered warming impeding or even reversing Asia’s recent economic progress.
The longer we wait to address the climate challenge, the more devastating the disruption will be.
And we may not get much warning, because climate effects generally do not evolve in a linear fashion, but rather emerge suddenly and powerfully, once certain tipping points have been reached.
So far, not nearly enough has been done to assess Asia’s exposure to climate impacts, much less to strengthen protections for vulnerable areas or reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
The region needs low-carbon green growth strategies that use less land, water, and energy.
These strategies will help to slow rapid urbanization, which entails dense construction, sealed roads, and private cars – all of which contribute to the “urban heat island” effect.
If we continue on our current path, the mean temperature over the Asian landmass could soar by more than 6°C (10.8°F), relative to pre-industrial levels, by 2100.
People may fall ill and even die from respiratory and other ailments caused by heat stress or pollution.
Beyond the human costs, higher temperatures would undermine agricultural and industrial productivity.
Climate-driven migration flows will exacerbate the challenges Asian cities face.
Unless a sufficient number of decent jobs are created, climate migrants could become a permanent underclass.
Even if jobs are available, the environmental pressure created by ever-more populated cities will pose a grave threat.
Yet projections of the impact of climate change on migration in Asia remain indefensibly limited in number, scope, and predictive power.
In order to improve city planning and health-care services, we need a simple and accurate way to assess current and future heat-tolerance levels among urban populations.
We also need strategies to decrease urban heat stress, including a shift toward polycentric urban configurations, with economies and societies built around multiple regional hubs, rather than concentrated around a single city, and natural assets maintained through eco-corridors and connected green spaces.
But rising temperatures are far from the only threat posed by climate change.
Extreme weather events, from droughts to floods, will intensify and become more frequent.
In Asia, increased rainfall and worsening tropical cyclones will wreak havoc on food production, driving down rural incomes.
In Sri Lanka, for example, rice yields could drop by up to 20% by 2050; in Fiji, cassava output could plummet by 36%.
All of this would be exacerbated by rising sea levels, which could be 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) higher by the end of the century, potentially causing many countries to lose more than 10% of their land area.
If countries meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the total sea-level rise could be halved, with more ambitious schemes promising even greater reductions.
If, however, we continue on our current path for just a couple more decades, we could trigger centuries of rising sea levels, even if we subsequently ended all greenhouse-gas emissions. The effects would be gradual but merciless.
The risks are arguably highest on Asia’s crowded coastlines, where millions of people are exposed to flooding.
And those risks continue to mount: in countries such as Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, and Vietnam, coastal populations are expected to double by 2060.
Asia is home to 13 of the 20 global cities expected to experience the sharpest increases in annual economic loss due to floods between now and 2050.
As it stands, the risks of sea-level rise for Asia’s coastal urban centers are still not sufficiently understood, nor have they been adequately integrated into planning processes.
This must change.
In flood-prone countries, city-planning schemes should blend gray infrastructure, such as drainage systems, dikes, and sea walls, with green measures, like conservation of wetlands and forests.
Improved meteorological observations and early-warning systems would also help substantially.
But here, again, there is a lack of adequate knowledge and preparation.
There is no systematic analysis of the economic costs and benefits of coastal fortification relative to other approaches.
“Softer” interventions, like better land-use planning and ecosystem-based approaches, are widely supported, but their effectiveness has been assessed in only a few small-scale studies.
Flood risks could complicate energy-infrastructure development in coastal cities in countries like Bangladesh and India.
Here, at least, the way forward is clearer: closer regional cooperation would help to offset power shortages, while off-grid energy from renewables and climate-resilient supply networks would help countries to enhance their energy security.
Given Asia’s massive size, population, and economic importance, it must be at the center of global efforts to mitigate climate change.
In many ways, Asia’s cities hold Earth’s future in their hands.
They must do their utmost to protect it.

Tradable Prosperity
MILAN – The global economy is experiencing a major growth challenge.
Many advanced countries are attempting to revive sustainable growth in the face of a decelerating global economy.
But the challenges across countries are not the same.
In particular, the tradable and non-tradable parts of a range of economies differ in important ways.
In the non-tradable sector (60-70% of the economy in advanced countries), the main growth inhibitors are weak demand, as in the United States following the financial crisis, and structural and competitive impediments to productivity, as in Japan.
In the tradable sector, growth depends on a country’s productivity relative to incomes and competitiveness.
At the global level, there can also be a shortage of aggregate demand on the tradable side.
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow has shown that growth comes from three sources: the working population, capital investment, and technological progress.
A growing young population helps to maintain fiscal balance and ensure intergenerational equity, but it does not by itself increase incomes.
On the other hand, economic growth below the sum of growth in the working population and the labor-saving part of technological change fuels unemployment.
Developing countries, once they enter rapid-growth mode, generate growth from capital deepening via investment, in a sense making up for past underinvestment.
And it is possible for advanced countries to fall behind by under-investing, particularly in the public sector, relying instead on less sustainable debt-fueled means of generating demand.
So a legitimate part of a strategy to restore growth is investment.
But, as Solow noted, investment has its limits, owing to diminishing marginal returns.
Often, these limits are not binding, but, once capital deepening is exhausted, technological progress, which makes inputs more productive in creating final value, is the long-run driver of growth.
The challenge is to apply these insights in a world characterized by global economic interdependence, major imbalances, and a worsening growth and employment problem.
It is a world in which economies are connected directly in the tradable sector of the global economy, and indirectly through the demand and employment linkages between the tradable and non-tradable sectors of individual economies.
In the short run, the non-tradable sector is, by definition, subject to domestic-demand constraints.
A shortfall in non-tradable demand inevitably limits growth on that side of the economy.
Government can, of course, bridge the gap via deficit spending (preferably focused on employment-generating investment that enhances future growth).
But the advanced countries are, to varying degrees, fiscally constrained by relatively high and rising public debt, largely owing to fiscal imbalances that were hidden from view until defective growth models broke down in the crisis of 2008.
Just how fiscally constrained these countries are remains subject to debate.
Italy and Spain are clearly constrained by the absence of private capital in their respective sovereign-debt markets, with rising yields threatening their fiscal stability and reform programs.
They need the eurozone core and the International Monetary Fund as temporary lenders of last resort until they restore policy credibility and regain investors’ confidence.
The US sovereign-debt market shows no similar evidence of having reached a limit yet.
But bond markets do not issue many early warning signals: witness the sudden run-up of yields in Italy and Spain a year ago.
The more complex growth issues have to do with the tradable part of the global economy, where global aggregate demand – and the derived demand that lands in various places in global supply or value-added chains – is the target of competition.
Total demand and its growth do matter, but so does market share.
Given the growth patterns across advanced and developing countries prior to the crisis, and then the large negative shock, it is likely that there is a shortfall of tradable global aggregate demand, impeding an important component of global growth.
But, for individual economies, relative productivity versus income levels determines the share of global tradable aggregate demand that is accessible.
Unlike the non-tradable side of the economy, the domestic component of global tradable demand is not an absolute constraint on growth; nor is the rate of growth of global tradable demand an absolute constraint, given the possibility of increasing share.
Of course, not everyone can gain share at the same time.
Fortunately, if countries increase productivity with the aim of boosting relative productivity and growth potential on the tradable side, this will increase incomes and accelerate the growth of global aggregate demand.
It may look like a zero-sum game, but it is not.
When incomes get significantly out of line with productivity levels (as they have recently), reviving growth requires resetting the terms of trade, which can be done with exchange rates, whether managed or set by markets.
In the eurozone, where countries with competitiveness problems do not have the exchange-rate adjustment mechanism, restrained income growth and productivity-boosting reforms are probably needed, as was the case in Germany between 2000 and 2006, and now in several southern European countries.
What is true for countries on the tradable side is also true for workers, who are differentially affected by the evolution of global supply chains.
The efficient integration of global supply chains has created employment opportunities in developing countries and in the higher value-added sectors of advanced countries.
But it has also reduced employment options for a subset of middle-income people in the tradable sectors of advanced economies.
Many countries are struggling to adapt their growth patterns to the new challenges they face in a slowing global economy.
To be effective and properly targeted, policies need to include an accurate diagnosis of growth potential and impediments in both the tradable and non-tradable parts of the economy.
Focusing on one (say, the competitiveness problem in the tradable sector) to the exclusion of the other (perhaps a serious non-tradable demand shortfall or stagnant absolute productivity) will not be enough.
