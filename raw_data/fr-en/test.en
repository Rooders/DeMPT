Lessons from the Economic-Epidemiological Frontier
LONDON/TURIN/OSLO – COVID-19 has led economists to turn to the models used by epidemiologists as they struggle to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and its likely costs.
The original epidemic model, commonly known as SIR, was introduced by William Ogilvy Kermack and Anderson Gray McKendrick almost a century ago.
It divides the population into those susceptible to the disease (S), those infected with it (I), and those who have either recovered or died from it (R).
In this standard model, an epidemic dies out when those exiting from the I cohort exceed the number of those entering it, owing to a declining stock of susceptible individuals.
One key feature of the literature is “herd immunity,” which allows for the number of infected people to fall to zero before the number of susceptible people does (meaning that there are some individuals who will avoid the disease altogether).
Economists have studied unemployment dynamics using similar transitions from one state to another, though this work came much later and was developed independently of the epidemiologists’ models.
A typical contribution is the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, wherein contacts between unemployed workers and firms lead to productive job matches, and thus to a transition from unemployment to employment.
There is a very important difference, however, between contacts that spread disease and those that lead to productive jobs.
Whereas a single infected person in an epidemic can infect many more people, an employer with a job vacancy can extend an offer to only one worker.
In economic terms, job vacancies are “exhaustible,” while an infectious disease is “non-exhaustible.”
Exhaustibility introduces a dynamic that has not been studied in the epidemiological literature.
If news arrives that public places are now host to people with an infectious disease, others will avoid interpersonal interactions, causing an economic downturn and reducing the infection rate.
The lower infection rate, in turn, will reduce the number of people being infected to below what it would have been with the parameters of the SIRmodel held constant.
Fewer infections implies that convergence toward herd immunity will be slower.
But, by applying the techniques of labor economics to the epidemiological literature, we can conjecture that the eventual herd-immunity state reached by people avoiding contact with one another will be one that maximizes the number of people who escape infection altogether.
Even so, one might ask whether governments are justified in requiring some degree of social distancing, rather than allowing for voluntary changes in behavior on the part of the public.
We believe they are, for at least two reasons.
First, although an individual might choose to restrict her social interactions, her exposure when she does enter public spaces (such as a grocery store) will depend on the extent to which everyone else also has chosen to restrict their interactions.
Hence, the level of contact – and of contagious risk – might be much higher than what the individual actually chose.
In labor economics, this dynamic is akin to the possibility of “increasing returns” from employment-matching technology – an outcome that has yet to be confirmed in labor markets, but that seems very likely when applied to an epidemic.
Second, during epidemics, governments might need to intervene to reduce the risk of medical services being overwhelmed.
It is up to the state to “flatten the treatment curve,” because individuals generally will ignore the impact that seeking treatment might have on others.
The main message that emerges from combining economic and epidemiological insights is that the population is better off when herd immunity is delayed through enforced social distancing, even though people’s natural reaction to an epidemic also will tend to reduce the infection rate.
Though government-mandated restrictions might lead to a longer recession and require more law enforcement, the eventual herd-immunity state will be one in which fewer people were infected, hospitalized, or killed by the disease.
To be sure, complete herd immunity under strict social-distancing measures may take several years to achieve.
Late in this process, the government might decide that the population is close enough to the finish line to start relaxing its restrictions, such as by reopening schools or certain kind of businesses.
But if people realize that they can still be infected, they might still choose to distance themselves from others, by working from home, keeping their children out of school, and so forth.
At that point, should governments reverse their social-distancing policies to the point of actually enforcing more activity than individuals might otherwise choose, such as by mandating school attendance?
That is a difficult question; unfortunately, it will most likely be a long time before policymakers have to answer it.

The End of Free-Lunch Economics
CHICAGO – Smart economic policymaking invariably requires trading off some pain today for greater future gains.
But this is a difficult proposition politically, especially in democracies.
It is always easier for elected leaders to indulge their constituents immediately, on the hope that the bill will not arrive while they are still in office.
Moreover, those who bear the pain caused by a policy are not necessarily those who will gain from it.
That is why today’s more advanced economies created mechanisms that allow them to make hard choices when necessary.
Chief among these are independent central banks and mandated limits on budget deficits.
Importantly, political parties reached a consensus to establish and back these mechanisms irrespective of their own immediate political priorities.
One reason why many emerging markets have swung from crisis to crisis is that they failed to achieve such consensus.
But recent history shows that developed economies, too, are becoming less tolerant of pain, perhaps because their own political consensus has eroded.
Financial markets have become volatile once again, owing to fears that the US Federal Reserve will have to tighten its monetary policy significantly to control inflation.
But many investors still hope that the Fed will go easy if asset prices start to fall substantially.
If the Fed proves them right, it will become that much harder to normalize financial conditions in the future.
Investors’ hope that the Fed will prolong the party is not baseless.
In late 1996, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan warned of financial markets’ “irrational exuberance.”
But the markets shrugged off the warning and were proved correct.
Perhaps chastened by the harsh political reaction to Greenspan’s speech, the Fed did nothing.
And when the stock market eventually crashed in 2000, the Fed cut rates, ensuring that the recession was mild.
In a testimony to the congressional Joint Economic Committee the previous year, Greenspan argued that while the Fed could not prevent “the inevitable economic hangover” from an asset-price boom, it could “mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion.”
The Fed thus assured traders and bankers that if they collectively gambled on similar assets, it would not limit the upside, but it would limit the downside if their bets turned bad.
Subsequent Fed interventions have entrenched such beliefs, making it even harder for the Fed to rein in financial markets with modest moves.
And now that much more tightening and consequent pain may be needed, a consensus in favor of it might be harder to achieve.
Fiscal policy is also guilty of peddling supposedly painless economic measures.
Most would agree that the pandemic created a need for targeted spending (through extended, generous unemployment benefits, for example) to shield the hardest-hit households.
But, in the event, the spending was anything but targeted.
The US Congress passed multi-trillion-dollar bills offering something for everyone.
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), for example, provided $800 billion in grants (effectively) for small businesses across the board.
A new study from MIT’s David Autor and his colleagues estimates that the program helped preserve 2-3 million job-years of employment over 14 months, at a stupendous cost of $170,000-$257,000 per job-year.
Worse, only 23-34% of this money went directly to workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs.
The balance went to creditors, business owners, and shareholders.
All told, an estimated three-quarters of PPP benefits went to the top one-fifth of earners.
Of course, the program may have saved some firms that otherwise would have collapsed. But at what cost?
While capitalists anticipate profits, they also sign up for possible failure.
Moreover, many small businesses are tiny operations without much organizational capital.
If a small bakery had to close, the economic fallout would have been mitigated by the enhanced unemployment insurance.
And if it had a loyal clientele, it could restart after the pandemic, perhaps with a little help from a bank.
The standard line is that the unconstrained spending was driven by a sense that unprecedented times called for unprecedented measures.
In fact, it was the response to the 2008 global financial crisis that broke the previous consensus for more prudent policies.
Lasting public resentment that Wall Street had been helped more than Main Street motivated politicians in both major parties to spend with abandon when the pandemic hit.
But targeted unemployment benefits were associated with the Democrats, leaving Republicans seeking wins for their own constituencies.
Who better to support than small businesses?
While political fractures were driving up untargeted spending, budget hawks were nowhere to be found: Their voices had been steadily drowned out by economists.
In addition to the cranks who show up periodically to advocate ostensibly free lunches through money-financed spending, a growing chorus of mainstream economists had been arguing that prevailing low interest rates gave developed countries significantly more room to expand fiscal deficits.
Politicians who were eager to justify their policies ignored these economists’ caveats – that spending had to be sensible, and that interest rates had to stay low.
Only the headline message mattered, and anyone suggesting otherwise was dismissed as a hair-shirt fanatic.
Historically, it has been the Fed’s job to take away the monetary punch bowl before the party gets frenzied, and Congress’s job to be prudent about fiscal deficits and debt.
But the Fed’s desire to spare the market from pain has driven more risk-taking, and reinforced expectations of further interventions.
The Fed’s actions have also added to the pressure on Congress to do its bit for Main Street, which in turn has led to inflation and a belief that the Fed will back off from raising rates.
All of this makes a return to the previous consensus more difficult.
When the Fed does raise rates significantly, the government’s costs of servicing the debt from past spending will limit future spending, including on policies to reduce inequality (which has fueled political fragmentation), combat future emergencies, and tackle climate change.
Every economy has a limited reservoir of policy credibility and resources, which are best used to mitigate genuine economic distress, not to shield those who can bear some pain.
If everyone wants a free lunch, the bill eventually will be paid by those least able to afford it.
Emerging-market economies have had to learn this the hard way.
Developed countries may have to learn it again.

Why We Strike Again
MADRID – For more than a year, children and young people from around the world have been striking for the climate.
We launched a movement that defied all expectations, with millions of people lending their voices – and their bodies – to the cause.
We did this not because it was our dream, but because we didn’t see anyone else taking action to secure our future.
And despite the vocal support we have received from many adults – including some of the world’s most powerful leaders – we still don’t.
Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options.
We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold.
Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world’s governments – the same governments that allow fossil-fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit.
Politicians and fossil-fuel companies have known about climate change for decades.
And yet the politicians let the profiteers continue to exploit our planet’s resources and destroy its ecosystems in a quest for quick cash that threatens our very existence.
Don’t take our word for it: scientists are sounding the alarm.
They warn that we have never been less likely to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the threshold beyond which the most destructive effects of climate change would be triggered.
Worse, recent research shows that we are on track to produce 120% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with the 1.5°C limit.The concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in our atmosphere has reached a record high, with no sign of a slowdown.
Even if countries fulfill their current emissions-reduction pledges, we are headed for a 3.2°C increase.
Young people like us bear the brunt of our leaders’ failures.
Research shows that pollution from burning fossil fuels is the world’s most significant threat to children’s health.
Just this month, five million masks were handed out at schools in New Delhi, India’s capital, owing to toxic smog.
Fossil fuels are literally choking the life from us.
The science is crying out for urgent action, and still our leaders dare to ignore it.
So we continue to fight.
After a year of strikes, our voices are being heard.
We are being invited to speak in the corridors of power.
At the UN, we addressed a room filled with world leaders.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, we met with prime ministers, presidents, and even the pope.
We have spent hundreds of hours participating in panels and speaking with journalists and filmmakers.
We have been offered awards for our activism.
Our efforts have helped to shift the wider conversation on climate change.
People now increasingly discuss the crisis we face, not in whispers or as an afterthought, but publicly and with a sense of urgency.
Polls confirm changing perceptions.
One recent survey showed that, in seven of the eight countries included, climate breakdown is considered to be the most important issue facing the world.
Another confirmed that schoolchildren have led the way in raising awareness.
With public opinion shifting, world leaders, too, say that they have heard us.
They say that they agree with our demand for urgent action to tackle the climate crisis.
But they do nothing.
As they head to Madrid for the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP25) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we call out this hypocrisy.
On the next two Fridays, we will again take to the streets: worldwide on November 29, and in Madrid, Santiago, and many other places on December 6 during the UN climate conference.
Schoolchildren, young people, and adults all over the world will stand together, demanding that our leaders take action – not because we want them to, but because the science demands it.
That action must be powerful and wide-ranging.
After all, the climate crisis is not just about the environment.
It is a crisis of human rights, of justice, and of political will.
Colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression have created and fueled it.
We need to dismantle them all.
Our political leaders can no longer shirk their responsibilities.
Some say that the Madrid conference is not very important; the big decisions will be made at COP26 in Glasgow next year.
We disagree.
As the science makes clear, we don’t have a single day to lose.
We have learned that, if we do not step up, nobody will.
So we will keep up a steady drumbeat of strikes, protests, and other actions.
We will become louder and louder.
We will do whatever it takes to persuade our leaders to unite behind science so clear that even children understand it.
Collective action works; we have proved that.
But to change everything, we need everyone.
Each and every one of us must participate in the climate resistance movement.
We cannot just say we care; we must show it.
Join us.
Participate in our upcoming climate strikes in Madrid or in your hometown.
Show your community, the fossil-fuel industry, and your political leaders that you will not tolerate inaction on climate change anymore.
With numbers on our side, we have a chance.
And to the leaders who are headed to Madrid, our message is simple: the eyes of all future generations are upon you.
Act accordingly.

Islam's Clash with Modernization
Ten years ago, Samuel Huntington argued that the fault lines of world politics in the post-Cold War era are mainly cultural - a ``clash of civilizations'' defined by five or six major cultural zones that can sometimes co-exist but will never converge, because they lack shared values.
One implication of this argument is that the September 11 th terrorist attacks, and the US-led response, should be viewed as part of a larger civilizational struggle between Islam and the West. Another is that what we in the West regard as universal human rights are simply an outgrowth of European culture, inapplicable to those who do not share this particular tradition.
I believe that Huntington is wrong on both counts.
Sir V. S. Naipaul, recently awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, once wrote an article entitled ``Our Universal Civilization.'' How appropriate.
Naipaul is, after all, an author of Indian descent who grew up in Trinidad. He argued not only that Western values are applicable across cultures, but that he owes his literary achievements to precisely that universality afforded by crossing Huntington's putative civilizational boundaries.
Universality is possible in broader terms as well, because the primary force in human history and world politics is not cultural plurality, but the general progress of modernization, whose institutional expressions are liberal democracy and market-oriented economics.
The current conflict is not part of a clash of civilizations in the sense that we are dealing with cultural zones of equal standing; rather, it is symptomatic of a rearguard action by those who are threatened by modernization, and thus by its moral component, respect for human rights.
Virtually any right that is or has been asserted historically relies on one of three authorities: God, man, or nature.
The original source of rights, God or religion, has been rejected in the West since the beginning of the Enlightenment.
John Locke's ``Second Discourse on Government'' begins with a long polemic against Robert Filmer's argument for the divine right of kings.
In other words, the secularism of the Western conception of rights lies at the root of the liberal tradition.
Today, this seems to be the major dividing line between Islam and the West, because many Muslims reject the secular state.
But before we endorse the idea of an irreducible clash of civilizations, we should consider why modern secular liberalism arose in the West in the first place.
It is no accident that liberal ideas emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, when bloody sectarian struggles between Christian sects throughout Europe exposed the impossibility of a religious consensus on which to base political rule.
Hobbes, Locke, and Montesquieu reacted to such horrors as the Thirty-Year War by arguing that religion and politics must be separated in the interest, first and foremost, of ensuring civil peace.
Islam now confronts a similar dilemma.
Efforts to unite politics and religion are dividing Muslims just as they divided Christians in Europe.
Our politicians are right (and not merely expedient) to insist that the current conflict is not with Islam - an extremely heterogeneous faith that recognizes no authoritative source of doctrinal interpretation.
Intolerance and fundamentalism form one choice for Muslims, but Islam has always had to contend with the question of secularism and the need for religious tolerance, as is evident from the ongoing reformist ferment in theocratic Iran.
The second source of rights - the essentially positivist view that whatever a society declares by some constitutional means to be a right becomes one - likewise provides no guarantee for liberalizing tendencies, for it leads to cultural relativism.
If, as Huntington implies, the rights that we claim in the West emerged uniquely from the political crisis of European Christianity after the Protestant Reformation, what is to stop other societies from appealing to their own local traditions to deny these rights?
The Chinese government is very adept at wielding this question.
The final source of rights is nature.
In fact, the language of natural rights - advanced most emphatically in 18 th century America - continues to shape our moral discourse.
When we say, for example, that race, ethnicity, wealth, and gender are all non-essential characteristics, this obviously implies that we believe that there is a substrate of ``humanness'' which entitles us to equal protection against certain types of behavior by other groups or states.
This belief is the ultimate reason to reject cultural arguments that would subordinate some - women, for example - within a society.
Moreover, the spread of democratic institutions in non-European contexts during the last decades of the 20 th century suggests that we in the West are not alone in this belief.
But if human rights are indeed universal, should we demand their implementation everywhere and at all times?
Aristotle argues in his Nicomachean Ethics that natural rules of justice exist, but that their application demands flexibility and prudence.
That insight remains valid today.
We must distinguish between a theoretical belief in the universality of human rights and the actual practice of supporting human rights around the world, for our shared ``humanness'' is shaped in varying social environments, such that our perception of rights differs.
In many traditional societies, where life choices and opportunities are limited, the Western, individualistic view of rights is very jarring. This is because the Western conception cannot be abstracted from the larger process of modernization.
To argue otherwise is to put the cart before the horse.
For our commitment to the universality of human rights forms but one part of the complex context of a universal civilization, from which an understanding of the other elements of modern societies - economic justice and political democracy - cannot be excluded.

The West’s Broken Promises on Education Aid
NEW YORK – The Global Partnership for Education, a worthy and capable initiative to promote education in 65 low-income countries, is having what the jargon of development assistance calls a “replenishment round,” meaning that it is asking donor governments to refill its coffers.
Yet the fact that the GPE is begging for mere crumbs – a mere $1 billion per year – exposes the charade of Western governments’ commitment to the global Education for All agenda.
The United States and the European Union have never cared that much about that agenda. When it comes to disease, they have at times been willing to invest to slow or stop epidemics like AIDS, malaria, and Ebola, both to save lives and to prevent the diseases from coming to their own countries.
But when it comes to education, many countries in the West are more interested in building walls and detention camps than schools.
The GPE does excellent work promoting primary education around the world. Donor countries, all of which long ago signed on to Education for All, should be clamoring to help one of the world’s most effective organizations to achieve that goal.
Yet generous donors are few and far between.
This reality extends back to imperial times.
When most of Africa and much of Asia were under European rule, the colonizers invested little in basic education.
As late as 1950, according to United Nations data, illiteracy was pervasive in Europe’s African and Asian colonies.
At the time of independence from Britain, India’s illiteracy rate stood at 80-85%, roughly the same as Indonesia’s illiteracy rate at the time of independence from the Netherlands.
In French West Africa, the illiteracy rate in 1950 stood at 95-99%.
After independence, African and Asian countries pursued massive and largely successful initiatives to raise basic education and literacy.
Yet, far from seizing this opportunity to make up for lost time, Europe and the US have provided consistently meager assistance for primary and secondary education, even as they have made high-profile commitments such as Education for All and Sustainable Development Goal 4, which calls for universal access to pre-primary through secondary school.
Consider the grim data on development aid for education, which has stagnated for years – and actually declined between 2010 and 2015.
According to the most recent OECD data, total donor aid for primary and secondary education in Africa amounted to just $1.3 billion in 2016.
To put that figure in perspective, the US Pentagon budget is roughly $2 billion per day.
With around 420 million African kids of school age, total aid amounted to roughly $3 per child per year.
It’s not as if Western governments don’t know that far more is needed.
Several detailed recent calculations provide credible estimates of how much external financing developing countries will need to achieve SDG 4.
A UNESCO study puts the total at $39.5 billion per year.
A report by the International Commission on Financing Education Opportunity, led by former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, similarly put developing countries’ external financing needs at tens of billions of dollars per year.
Here is the reason why aid is needed. A year of education in Africa requires at least $300 per student.
(Note that the rich countries spend several thousand dollars per student per year.) With Africa’s school-age population accounting for roughly one-third of the total, the per capita financing requirement is about $100.
Yet for a typical African country, that’s about 10% of per capita national income – far more than the education budget can cover.
External aid can and should cover the financing gap so that all children can attend school.
That’s not happening.
Annual spending per school-aged child in Sub-Saharan Africa is roughly one-third of the minimum needed.
As a result, most kids don’t come anywhere close to finishing secondary school.
They are forced to drop out early, because there are no openings in public schools and tuition for private school is far too high for most families.
Girls are especially likely to leave school early, though parents know that all of their children need and deserve a quality education.
Without the skills that a secondary education provides, the children who leave school early are condemned to poverty.
Many eventually try to migrate to Europe in desperate search of a livelihood.
Some drown on the way; others are caught by European patrols and returned to Africa.
So now comes the GPE’s replenishment round, scheduled for early February in Senegal.
The GPE should be receiving at least $10 billion a year (about four days’ military spending by the NATO countries) to put Africa on a path toward universal secondary education.
Instead, the GPE is reportedly still begging donors for less than $1 billion per year to cover GPE programs all over the world.
Instead of actually solving the education crisis, rich-country leaders go from speech to speech, meeting to meeting, proclaiming their ardent love of education for all.
Across Africa, political, religious, and civil-society leaders are doing what they can.
Ghana has recently announced free upper-secondary education for all, setting the pace for the continent.
As African countries struggle to fund their ambitious commitments, new partners, including private companies and high-net-worth individuals, should step forward to help them.
Traditional donors, for their part, have decades of lost time to make up for.
The quest for education will not be stopped, but history will judge harshly those who turn their backs on children in need.

The Balkans Between Competing Poles
MADRID – Few world regions are more culturally and politically complex than the Balkans.
And there may be no clearer illustration of the region’s freighted past and present than the life and legacy of one of its exceptional sons: the physicist and inventor Nikola Tesla.
Born into an Orthodox Serbian family in 1856 in a town that is now part of Croatia, Tesla’s nationality remains an object of debate in the region.
Tesla believed that scientific advances should be used to build bridges between countries, and ultimately to achieve universal peace.
But there are some in both Croatia and Serbia who want to appropriate his legacy in ways that do not do it justice.
Even Tesla’s contributions to the field of physics have evoked the complicated political dynamics of his native land.
In the International System of Units, a tesla is a measurement for the flux density of a magnetic field.
And as Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, pointed out a few months ago, “The Balkans can easily become one of the chessboards where the big power game can be played.” Indeed, the region has always been situated between competing poles, each projecting power through interwoven economic, political, historical, and cultural links.
For the EU, the wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s signified an utter failure.
After the violence subsided, the EU tried to use its own magnetic pull to bring the former Yugoslav territories together through a process of reconstruction and reconciliation.
But this strategy has produced uneven results.
Although some Eastern Orthodox-majority countries – Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania – have acceded to the EU, the only post-Yugoslav countries to join – Croatia and Slovenia – are predominantly Catholic, a reality that feeds a counterproductive narrative.
When Germany and the Vatican quickly recognized Croatia and Slovenia in 1991 and 1992, they reinforced the sense of what the late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington subsequently called a “clash of civilizations.” For Huntington, the Yugoslav wars fit his simplistic paradigm perfectly, with Western Christianity – Catholicism and Protestantism – on one side, and the rest of Europe’s religions on the other.
Croatia and Slovenia have both demanded that the “Western Balkans 6” – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia – be incorporated into the EU as well.
But progress has been hampered by a congeries of bilateral political disputes between Western Balkan and EU countries, similar to when Slovenia, taking advantage of EU membership, temporarily blocked Croatia’s accession.
Moreover, circumstances within the EU itself – economic crises and the rise of xenophobic political parties in recent years – have put its enlargement policy on the back burner, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announcing in 2014 that no new members would be accepted before 2019.
At the same time, democratic norms and institutions in the Western Balkans have been eroding.
Other countries with a strong influence in the region – not least Russia, Turkey, and Hungary, where the EU has failed to prevent a drift toward authoritarianism under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – are offering alternative political models for Western Balkan countries to follow.
Consider the relationship between Serbia and Russia.
During a visit to Belgrade in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin went so far as to say that, “Russia, just as it was in the past, will always see Serbia as our closest ally.” In addition to its longstanding cultural ties with Russia, Serbia depends on Russian energy supplies, as well as Russia’s veto power as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
As long as Serbia remains in Russia’s good graces, it can block Kosovo from joining the UN.
These factors explain why Serbia did not join the EU in imposing sanctions against Russia after it annexed Crimea in March 2014.
Bosnia and Macedonia also chose not to participate in the EU sanctions, while NATO members Albania and Montenegro did.
Still, the Balkan countries are not simply particles drawn passively toward the magnetic poles around them.
Serbia, for example, finds inspiration in the legacy of Marshal Tito, who was president of Yugoslavia for much of the Cold War.
Far from being the Soviet Union’s closest ally, Tito was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement, and excelled at playing the United States and the Soviet Union off against each other.
Similarly, Serbia today is officially designated as a neutral state.
But it collaborates closely with NATO through its Partnership for Peace, while at the same time hosting military exercises with the Russian army.
Likewise, while Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić claims to be firmly in favor of European integration, he has displayed no willingness to distance himself from Russia.
Of course, in addition to Russia, China has also opposed recognizing Kosovo.
Through its “Belt and Road Initiative,” China has flexed its economic muscle, investing millions of dollars in infrastructure projects in Serbia and other parts of the region.
One initiative is a high-speed rail line between Belgrade and Budapest, which is meant to connect the Greek port of Piraeus with Central Europe.
The European Commission is currently investigating the Belgrade-Budapest line for possible violations of EU tendering rules.
The inquiry hints at an underlying trend: though China does not harbor Russia’s disruptive ambitions, its actions may well leave the Western Balkans questioning their incentive to converge with the EU’s institutional model and accompanying rules.
Despite these challenges, the EU maintains a favorable position vis-à-vis the Western Balkans.
Excluding Croatia, 74% of Western Balkan countries’ total trade is with the EU, compared to only 6% with China, 5% with Russia, and 4% with Turkey.
In this context, the EU should not permit current challenges to weaken its overall enlargement strategy.
The Western Balkans Summit last month was a positive step, provided that the countries still eager to join the EU do not lose sight of the need to enact deep reforms.
The EU must not fall short of the expectations that Tesla undoubtedly would have had for it.
All Europeans should be afforded the opportunity to participate in the European project and benefit from its transformative potential.
That is precisely what a large segment of the Balkan population still wants.
EU leaders cannot guarantee that the process of joining the bloc will be quick and easy.
But only they can ensure that the journey will be worth it.

The Ideological Crisis of Western Capitalism
NEW YORK – Just a few years ago, a powerful ideology – the belief in free and unfettered markets – brought the world to the brink of ruin.
Even in its hey-day, from the early 1980’s until 2007, American-style deregulated capitalism brought greater material well-being only to the very richest in the richest country of the world.
Indeed, over the course of this ideology’s 30-year ascendance, most Americans saw their incomes decline or stagnate year after year.
Moreover, output growth in the United States was not economically sustainable.
With so much of US national income going to so few, growth could continue only through consumption financed by a mounting pile of debt.
I was among those who hoped that, somehow, the financial crisis would teach Americans (and others) a lesson about the need for greater equality, stronger regulation, and a better balance between the market and government.
Alas, that has not been the case.
On the contrary, a resurgence of right-wing economics, driven, as always, by ideology and special interests, once again threatens the global economy – or at least the economies of Europe and America, where these ideas continue to flourish.
In the US, this right-wing resurgence, whose adherents evidently seek to repeal the basic laws of math and economics, is threatening to force a default on the national debt.
If Congress mandates expenditures that exceed revenues, there will be a deficit, and that deficit has to be financed.
Rather than carefully balancing the benefits of each government expenditure program with the costs of raising taxes to finance those benefits, the right seeks to use a sledgehammer – not allowing the national debt to increase forces expenditures to be limited to taxes.
This leaves open the question of which expenditures get priority – and if expenditures to pay interest on the national debt do not, a default is inevitable.
Moreover, to cut back expenditures now, in the midst of an ongoing crisis brought on by free-market ideology, would inevitably simply prolong the downturn.
A decade ago, in the midst of an economic boom, the US faced a surplus so large that it threatened to eliminate the national debt.
Unaffordable tax cuts and wars, a major recession, and soaring health-care costs – fueled in part by the commitment of George W. Bush’s administration to giving drug companies free rein in setting prices, even with government money at stake – quickly transformed a huge surplus into record peacetime deficits.
The remedies to the US deficit follow immediately from this diagnosis: put America back to work by stimulating the economy; end the mindless wars; rein in military and drug costs; and raise taxes, at least on the very rich.
But the right will have none of this, and instead is pushing for even more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, together with expenditure cuts in investments and social protection that put the future of the US economy in peril and that shred what remains of the social contract.
Meanwhile, the US financial sector has been lobbying hard to free itself of regulations, so that it can return to its previous, disastrously carefree, ways.
But matters are little better in Europe.
As Greece and others face crises, the medicine du jour is simply timeworn austerity packages and privatization, which will merely leave the countries that embrace them poorer and more vulnerable.
This medicine failed in East Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere, and it will fail in Europe this time around, too. Indeed, it has already failed in Ireland, Latvia, and Greece.
There is an alternative: an economic-growth strategy supported by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Growth would restore confidence that Greece could repay its debts, causing interest rates to fall and leaving more fiscal room for further growth-enhancing investments.
Growth itself increases tax revenues and reduces the need for social expenditures, such as unemployment benefits.
And the confidence that this engenders leads to still further growth.
Regrettably, the financial markets and right-wing economists have gotten the problem exactly backwards: they believe that austerity produces confidence, and that confidence will produce growth.
But austerity undermines growth, worsening the government’s fiscal position, or at least yielding less improvement than austerity’s advocates promise.
On both counts, confidence is undermined, and a downward spiral is set in motion.
Do we really need another costly experiment with ideas that have failed repeatedly? We shouldn’t, but increasingly it appears that we will have to endure another one nonetheless.
A failure of either Europe or the US to return to robust growth would be bad for the global economy.
A failure in both would be disastrous – even if the major emerging-market countries have attained self-sustaining growth.
Unfortunately, unless wiser heads prevail, that is the way the world is heading.

Three Cheers for Brazil
World markets seem to be turning up their nose at Brazil right now.
They may be as mistaken about Brazil as world football experts were earlier this summer.
When the World Cup began, you will recall, the Brazilian team was deemed talented but flawed.
Yet somehow Brazil again became the World Cup champion.
The country, too, may prove equally surprising and resilient.
Indeed, in recent years, Brazil has created a vibrant democracy with a strong economy.
It deserves a vote of confidence from investors and political leaders alike.
As in any vibrant democracy, differences in views exist.
Not all Americans are enthused about President Bush's rapid conversion of trillion dollar surpluses into deficits, nor does a majority embrace his proposals to privatize America's social security system, which has done so much to eliminate poverty among America's elderly.
On key issues within Brazil, however, a broad political consensus (not unanimity, but no one should expect that!) exists, and this includes all the major contenders in Brazil's forthcoming presidential election in October.
There is a consensus, for instance, on sound fiscal and monetary policies: no one wants to return to the hyperinflation of earlier decades.
Brazil's monetary policy has been managed extraordinarily well by Arminio Fraga (my former student), but behind him is a strong institution , with the analytic capacities of a first world Central Bank.
The initiative that Brazil's Central Bank made to increase transparency and openness are a model for central banks throughout the world--in the developed world as well as the less developed.
To be sure, there may be disagreements about fine-tuning the economy, but such are routine in any democracy.
There is also a broad consensus that while markets are at the center of a successful economy, there is an important role for government.
Brazil's government, for instance, pushed one of the most successful telecom privatizations, but also pushed for stronger competition and regulatory policies.
Unlike America, when the country faced an electricity crisis, it didn't blithely sit by, saying let market forces (which in the US, meant market manipulation by Enron and others) "handle" the matter; rather, the government came in with strong actions.
As an American, I looked on in envy as Brazil managed its way through a difficult situation.
Brazil is a country of extraordinary human and physical resources.
It may be called an emerging market, but it has first rate financial, educational and research institutions.
Discussions about economics in Sao Paulo are as sophisticated as in New York.
University seminars in Rio are as lively as those in Cambridge, Mass or Cambridge U.K.
It produces one of the finest airplanes in the world--so good that competitors in the more advanced industrial countries have tried to impose trade barriers.
But Brazil, for all of its strengths, has one critical weakness: a high level of inequality.
It is a weakness that (unlike in America) also carries a broad consensus: most agree that it needs to be addressed, and that government has the obligation to do so.
The current government has made extraordinary strides in education.
Ten yeas ago, 20% of Brazil's school age children were not attending school; now that number is down to 3%.
Whoever wins the election almost certainly will continue to make further investments in education.
Similarly, landless peasants are both an economic and a social problem, and the current administration has taken on vested interests to push forward on an exciting market-based land reform, one which has received support from the World Bank.
Whoever wins the election will in all likelihood pursue a strong land reform program.
With the AIDS epidemic, Brazil faces challenges to its health system, and while one may agree or disagree with the particular approaches taken by the Brazilian government, this much is clear: everyone recognizes that this is a major responsibility of government.
Moreover, whoever wins the election almost surely will reflect that broad national consensus.
Brazil's debt to GDP ratio is moderate--better than in the US at the time Bill Clinton became president, far better than that of Japan and several European countries.
Unlike its neighbor to the south (prior to Argentina's crisis), Brazil has a flexible exchange rate system: its currency is not overvalued--if anything, it is undervalued.
With strong exports, it should have no problem meeting its debt obligations, so long as interest rates do not soar to levels that turn a problem into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Brazil has carved out a path that is not based on ideology or over-simplistic economics.
It seizes opportunities while confronting and dealing with harsh realities, whether these are lack of education, landlessness, or AIDS.
By successfully charting its own course, Brazil has created a broad domestic consensus behind a balanced, democratic, market economy.
Brazil's victory in the World Cup may have no connection with these reforms, but the creativity of that winning team does say a great deal about the spirit of the country.

Populists Are Sometimes Right
Developing countries are often advised (or instructed) to undertake reforms recommended by "experts" who are called "technocrats" and are often backed by the IMF.
Opposition to the reforms they propose is usually dismissed as "populist."
Countries that fail to undertake these reforms are dismissed as craven or lacking political will, and soon suffer the consequences: higher interest rates when borrowing abroad.
But look closely at some of these "technocratic" proposals: many are more often based on ideology than economic science.
Technocrats can of course reliably make an electricity plant work better.
The goal is simple: to produce electricity at as low a price as possible.
This is mostly a matter of engineering, not politics.
Economic policies are usually not technocratic in this sense.
They involve tradeoffs: some may lead to higher inflation but lower unemployment; some help investors, others workers.
Economists call policies where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off Pareto efficient.
If a single policy is better than all others for everyone , i.e., has no Pareto-efficient alternatives, it is said to be Pareto dominant .
If choices among policies were purely Paretian, i.e., if no one was made worse off by choosing one policy, as against another, the choices involved would indeed be purely "technical."
But in reality, few policy choices are Paretian.
Instead, some policies are better for some groups, but worse for others.
Different policies benefit and hurt different groups.
In East Asia, for example, IMF bailouts helped international lenders, but hit workers and domestic firms hard.
Different policies might have imposed more risk on international lenders, and less on workers and domestic firms.
Deciding which policy to choose involves choices among values, not just technical questions about which policy is in some morally uncontroversial sense "better."
These value choices are political choices , which cannot be left to technocrats.
Of course, there is scope for technical analysis even when political choices are at the crux of the decision.
Technocrats can sometimes help avoid Pareto inferior policies, that is, policies that make everyone worse off.
Sometimes there are policies that can promote both growth and equality, and the job of good economists is to search for them.
The problem is that many policies advanced by technocrats as if they were Pareto efficient are in fact flawed and make many people--sometimes entire countries--worse off.
Look at the litany of technocratically inspired examples of privatization and deregulation in the 1990's.
Banking "reform," for example, frequently soon required government bail-outs, leaving a few people much richer, but the country much poorer.
These failures suggest that we should have less confidence in the supposed professional skills of technocrats--or at least less confidence than they have in themselves.
But there is also a more fundamental point here.
Democratic processes are likely to be more sensitive to the real consequences of policies, to the real tradeoffs involved.
Of course, some criticisms of technocratic remedies may be populist posturing, but sometimes they contain insights that ivory-towered (and usually US-trained) technocrats miss.
Consider the case of Mexico, where a proposal to raise revenue by taxing food and medicines consumed by the poor was, unsurprisingly, rejected by a democratically accountable legislature.
Rejecting this proposal was not a matter of unbridled populism.
The problem was with the proposal.
Its advocates argued that efficiency required adopting a comprehensive Value Added Tax.
Advanced industrial countries in Europe use such a tax.
Developing countries, the technocrats said, should do likewise.
But there is a fundamental difference between developed European countries and emerging markets: the size of the informal sector, from which VAT is not collected.
This vast "black economy" makes VAT inefficient in most developing countries.
Indeed, because VAT is a tax on the formal sector--the new factories, banks, and so forth that pay regular salaries and whose incomes and expenditures can easily be traced (as distinct from those of the cash-based street vendors, village enterprises, and poor farmers)--VAT impedes development.
The logic is simple.
Developing countries that impose a VAT perversely encourage production to remain in the informal sector, which often produces the goods that are consumed domestically or used as inputs in the developed world.
But it is the formal sector that produces higher value-added manufactured goods that compete with developed countries.
There are other sources of tax revenue in many developing countries that are both more equitable and distort economic incentives far less than VAT.
Many developing countries lack a corporate income tax: the huge profits of the telecom, cement, and other monopoly sectors escape taxation.
(If one worried about double taxation, one could allow a credit for corporate taxes on individual tax returns.)
It may also be possible to impose taxes on luxury goods (many of which are imported), thereby promoting equity without stifling growth.
Economic theory supports a VAT only if one does not care about distribution and if one can impose a tax on all commodities.
You don't need an economics doctorate to recognize that, in developing countries, you can't impose a tax on all commodities.
Moreover, you should care about equity.
So the next time you hear rumblings in the legislature of an emerging democratic country against this or that "technocratic" proposal, think twice before dismissing the deputies' doubts as populist rants.
Perhaps the populists are popular because they know something that the technocrats don't.

The Bogey of Inflation
LONDON – How real is the danger of inflation for the world economy?
Opinion on this matter is divided between conservative economists and official bodies like the IMF and OECD.
The IMF and OECD project very low inflation rates over the next few years.
But former US Federal Reserv e Chairman Alan Greenspan warns of inflationary dangers.
Some bond markets, too, seem to expect sharply higher inflation.
Which view is right has big implications for policy.
If inflation has succeeded recession as today’s main problem, governments should withdraw their stimulus policies (money out of the economy) as soon as possible.
If recession remains the problem, the stimulus policies should stay in place, or even be strengthened.
Everyone expects some inflation.
During the low-inflation era, which dates from the early 1990’s, developed-country annual inflation rates averaged 2.4%.
Central bank inflation targets are now normally set at 2%.
Monetarists hail the low-inflation era as their great achievement.
They take pride in the expert “management of expectations” by central banks.
But monetary policy had little to do with it.
Low inflation resulted from a combination of cheap supply and low demand.
There was huge downward pressure on manufacturing prices from low-wage Asian economies, while unemployment in the developed world averaged 5-6% – about twice as high as in the earlier post-war decades.
Inflation was on the rise before the recession of 2008 struck, mainly because of spiking commodity prices.
This is the background against which to judge the reality of today’s inflation threat.
The first thing to notice is that, as a result of the slump, capacity utilization is lower than it was 15 months ago: global output has declined by roughly 5% since 2008, and developed-country output by 4.1%.
One would expect inflation to fall with the decline in output, and this is exactly what happened.
OECD inflation fell from an annual average of 3.7% in 2008 to around 0.5% in 2009.
It has now started to rise again, but from a low level, mainly as a result of a turnabout in commodity prices.
Moreover, the IMF and OECD estimate that global inflation will remain below the pre-2008 average for years.
In other words, the low-inflation era will become the lower-inflation era.
But what about the vast quantitative easing (printing of money) that has been occurring?
Since the start of the crisis, the Bank of England has pumped $325 billion into the British economy, the Fed has expanded the US monetary base by close to $1 trillion, and the People’s Bank of China originated a record amount of $1.4 trillion in loans.
These measures alone correspond to 4% of global GDP.
Surely that means that inflation is just round the corner unless the money is withdrawn fast, right?
For those who have had a couple of lessons in the Quantity Theory of Money, this seems a plausible conclusion.
The quantity theory states that the general price level will rise proportionately to the increase in the money supply.
So if the money supply increased by 5% globally in the last year, world prices will rise by 5% after a short lag.
But, as John Maynard Keynes never stopped pointing out, the Quantity Theory of Money is true only at full employment.
If there is unused capacity in the economy, part of any increase in the quantity of money will be spent on increasing output rather than just buying existing output.
This is only half the story, however.
By “quantity of money,” experts normally mean M3, a broad measure that includes bank deposits.
Flooding banks with central-bank money is no guarantee that deposits, which arise from spending or borrowing money, will increase in the same proportion.
In the 1990’s, the Japanese central bank injected huge amounts of money into banks in an attempt to boost the money supply.
At one time, central-bank money was up by 35% in one year, yet M3 was rose by only 7%.
Data from Europe and the US show that M3 has been falling for most of 2009, despite exceptionally low interest rates and quantitative easing.
What matters is not printing money, but spending it.
It is when money is spent that it becomes more than an inert bundle of useless paper.
A central bank can print money, but it cannot ensure that the money it prints is spent.
It may pile up in bank reserves or savings accounts, or it may produce asset bubbles.
But in such cases, little or no increase in the money supply occurs.
The new money simply replaces the old money, which has been liquidated by economic collapse.
That is why official data points to extremely low inflation rates over the next few years, despite the monetary and fiscal stimulus.
But this should be a warning signal: to say that with unemployment now much higher, inflation is expected to remain low is really to say that there will be little recovery over the next five years.
After all, when economies recover from recession, they usually grow above trend.
This means that prices will rise above trend.
The fact that there is no evidence of higher prices in the pipeline means that there is no real evidence of economic recovery.
Our economies are still on life support.
To withdraw the stimulus at this point would kill the patient.
To talk about the dangers of inflation is scaremongering.
Instead, we should be thinking of ways to restore the patient’s health.
To be sure, different economies are at different phases of convalescence, and faster growth in some regions – for example, China and India – will help feebler ones like Europe and America.
But, unless firmer evidence of recovery comes in the next quarter, European and American officials should prepare to accelerate and expand their spending programs.
Otherwise, their economies risk remaining stuck in recession.

Europe Versus the Islamic State
PARIS – After the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris that left 130 dead, I wrote a commentary entitled “We Are At War” – and faced considerable criticism from readers, Europeans and non-Europeans alike.
How dare I use the word “war” to describe the attacks!
Words are weapons, and misusing them is irresponsible, even dangerous.
Had I not learned anything from George W. Bush’s jingoism?
In fact, I knew exactly what I was doing when I chose that word.
And last week, when Brussels faced a terrorist attack on its airport and a metro station, the emergency services personnel chose the same word, calling for the treating of “war wounds.”
So I will say it again: We are at war.
Of course, it is not a traditional war.
No formal declaration of hostilities was made; but the attacks on Paris and Brussels were acts of war – deliberate and brutal maneuvers planned by a group of people controlling a large chunk of territory.
These acts targeted not just Europe’s people, but also its fundamental values, and they are part of a broader pattern of aggression that will not simply fade away.
Indeed, though the Islamic State’s territory may be shrinking in Syria and Iraq, it is expanding in Libya.
And who knows which countries ISIS may seize tomorrow?
Parts of Algeria, for example, could be vulnerable.
It is time for the European Union to recognize the reality – it is at war, whether it likes it or not – and respond accordingly.
If there was ever a moment since the end of World War II when Europe needed to take charge of its security, it is now.
This means both managing the threat at home and taking a leading role in the fight against ISIS, not only because of Europe’s geographical proximity, but because of the past contributions some of its member states, such as France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, have made to destabilizing the region.
In this endeavor, it is critical that the terrorists are not conflated with the refugees flowing into Europe.
The refugees, who are being driven out of their homes largely by the actions of ISIS and other violent actors, represent an important opportunity for Europe.
Today’s surging European populists, who hold European values in contempt, cannot be allowed to cause us to miss that opportunity through bigotry and fear mongering.
Of course, terrorism is not the only security threat that the EU currently faces.
With the United States focused on Asia and the Middle East (not to mention itself), it is up to EU leaders to grasp the nettle of limiting Russia’s ambitions in the eastern part of Europe.
At a time when the EU – which, if given the choice, would tend to focus its attention inward – must confront such daunting external challenges, the last thing it needs is a destabilizing internal challenge.
Yet that is precisely what it is facing, thanks to Prime Minister David Cameron’s feckless attempt to appease the rabid anti-Europeans in his Conservative Party by planning a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member.
When your shared house is in danger of burning down, you work with the other tenants to put out the fire; you don’t fuss over who should carry the hose.
The discrepancy between what Europe needs and what it is ready to do reflects a gap between reason and emotion.
Rationally, the need for greater European cooperation on security and defense, as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has noted, is obvious.
Emotionally, however, the reverse appears to be true, as illustrated by the EU’s failure to formulate a common policy toward the arriving refugees.
Like Renzi today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was alone in her plea for a humane response to the refugee crisis.
For most Europeans, the situation seemed overwhelming, so they shrank from it.
“Refugees, this is your problem,” Latvian President Raimonds Vējonis famously told Merkel in a European Council meeting last year.
Terrorism, with its unpredictable tactics and nebulous borders, elicits a similar response.
The challenge is so overwhelming, in fact, that EU countries have been unable even to share information effectively.
A similar problem arose after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the US, which then withheld information even from its closest allies, Canada and the UK.
I saw the frustration this caused first-hand in January 2002 at the World Economic Forum, where I co-chaired a private session among Western security chiefs.
Today, according to Europe’s self-determined pecking order, there are the French and British intelligence and security services, and then there are the rest.
Belgium, poorly regarded in this area, given its weak state structures and complex linguistic and cultural identities, is not receiving the information that the French and British are collecting.
But this is no time for arrogance, much less fear and concealment.
If terrorists are targeting Europe, it is because they believe Europe is the West’s weak link.
For its own sake, Europe must prove them wrong.
The only way to do that is to stop allowing the emotional desire to hide behind nationalist claims to overwhelm the rational recognition that united action is the only way to be safer.

Returning to Investment
GENEVA – At the G20 summit last month in Hangzhou, China, world leaders outlined an ambitious plan for a “new era of global growth.”
But they left out a key ingredient: fixing the investment climate.
Conventional wisdom holds that, through efficient financial markets, household savings will flow to companies that can best put the money to productive use.
But in many developing countries, easier access to finance – owing to unrestricted cross-border capital flows and financial-market deregulation – still has not led to more financing for long-term investments, particularly in manufacturing.
Investment decisions depend on a variety of complex factors and contingencies, and a mix of public and private finance is crucial for bringing new projects to fruition.
In East Asia, which has experienced rapid growth and development in recent years, policymakers have not only allowed, but encouraged, higher corporate profits, so long as they are channeled into productive investments.
As a result, as much as four-fifths of large East Asian companies’ investment spending is funded from retained earnings, while publicly owned financial institutions have helped maintain the pace of investment-led growth.
An imbalance between profits and investment is a major reason for today’s tepid growth in developed and developing countries alike; unless it is addressed, the result could be a wider crisis of legitimacy for corporate governance and economic management.
In developed economies, corporate profitability has been steadily rising, partly owing to “shareholder-primacy” strategies that focus on short-term decision-making, cost-cutting measures, and other forms of financial engineering encouraged by institutional investors.
To varying degrees, conventional “retain-and-invest” strategies are being replaced by “downsize-and-distribute” strategies, whereby profits are spent on increased dividends, stock buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions.
In developing economies, global financial flows have most visibly contributed to macroeconomic shocks that fuel economic uncertainty, which shortens corporations’ investment-planning horizon.
More recently, one can also see developing-economy companies pursuing the same corporate-governance strategies as firms in developed countries.
Judging by non-financial firms’ balance sheets, investment-to-profit ratios decreased from 1995 to 2014, with especially steep declines in Brazil, Malaysia, South Korea, and Turkey.
Large public corporations are less common in most developing economies than they are in developed economies; but for those firms that do regularly distribute dividends in developing economies, payouts to shareholders have been increasing, even when profitability has remained roughly the same.
Such firms are also accumulating financial assets – sometimes faster than they are accumulating corporate debt – which suggests that they lack profitable long-term investment opportunities and portfolio-investment options in liberalized financial markets.
It would be premature to suggest that the relationship between profits and investments has broken down in the developing world.
But, as corporate profitability has risen across the board, investment trends everywhere (with the exception of China and India) have been weak, which was true even before the 2008 global financial crisis.
Meanwhile, financialization continues to disrupt macroeconomic stability worldwide.
For example, developed economies’ quantitative easing programs have contributed to excess liquidity – and thus to the recent corporate-debt explosion in emerging economies.
Across a sample of these economies, non-financial corporations’ dollar-denominated debt rose by 40%, on average, from 2010 to 2014; from 2007 to 2015, their debt-service ratios also soared by 40%.
These numbers suggest a systemic banking crisis in the making.
Moreover, debt-fueled investment has been concentrated in highly cyclical natural-resources-based sectors that do not contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth.
In fact, just seven sectors – oil and gas, electricity, construction, industrial commodities, real estate, telecommunications, and mining – account for more than two-thirds of the total increase in both debt and investment.
This suggests that easy access to cheap money and debt financing have not favored the high-tech sectors that contribute the most to productivity growth.
To reverse these trends, we must first reverse the trend in emerging economies toward highly financialized corporate strategies.
This will require changes in corporate governance generally, and in non-financial corporations’ incentive structures, including preferential tax treatment for retained profits and equity finance, and special depreciation allowances for reinvested profits.
Beyond corporate governance, we must restore balance to the profit-investment relationship through institutional as well as public-policy initiatives, and with proactive industrial policies.
This will require reforming and deepening the banking system to ensure enough lending capacity for long-term investments, including for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
As for the macroeconomic environment, governments can improve conditions through public investment, particularly in infrastructure, which will augment productivity and add to private-sector profitability.
Lastly, the international community should vigorously pursue efforts to police tax avoidance and capital flight, both of which erode states’ revenue base.
Long-term investment in productive assets is essential to ensuring the sustained growth that developing economies need.
But they won’t achieve it by maintaining an environment that encourages short-term strategies.

Syria’s Dangerous Liaisons
All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Opposition groups in Lebanon, as well as Hariri supporters, openly accused Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime of being responsible for the killing.
The Bush administration, while not formally blaming Syria, virtually did so and recalled its ambassador to Damascus.
The US is said to be extremely angry at Syria’s refusal to withdraw its forces from Lebanon in line with a United Nations resolution.
Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces, all of which it has addressed inadequately.
The other three are Syria’s behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform.
While corrosive immobility is a trademark of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria internationally even more so than today.
In Lebanon, the Syrians have repeatedly misread the Bush administration’s intentions.
Last September, the US, together with France, sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias – mainly Hezbollah.
This came after Assad last September imposed an unconstitutional extension of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud’s mandate, despite French and American warnings.
Yet to this day, Syrian officials privately say that they don’t think the US is serious about a withdrawal.
Syria’s leaders also continue to dismiss demands from within Lebanon for an end to Syria’s 28-year military presence.
Such demands escalated dramatically after Hariri’s death, as tens of thousands of the former prime minister’s partisans, who previously sat on the fence when it came to Syria, shouted “Syria out.”
Indeed, a broad multi-communal opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand Syria’s departure.
Yet rather than address the front’s demands and shape a healthy bilateral relationship between equal countries, Syria has sought to divide the opposition and reassert control.
Hariri’s assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France.
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Damascus has shown undue nostalgia for the old system.
Though the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties were bitter foes, there was consolation in that both were members of a confederacy of despotisms.
For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein, the enemy they knew – and later profitably traded with – during the years of international sanctions against Iraq.
Syria’s suspected support for Iraqi Baathist exiles threatens to damage relations with the new Iraq.
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime of allowing Iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents, and recently notified the Syrians that the photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence official taken with an Islamist combatant was found on the latter’s body in Falluja.
As a legitimate Iraqi authority emerges following the elections, the Syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-Saddam acquaintances.
The Bush administration’s growing impatience with Syrian involvement in the Iraqi insurgency is a major reason for Syria’s deteriorating relationship with the US.
Indeed, there is palpable disdain for Syria in Washington.
That is why Syria’s denials that it is playing a spoiler role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously, and why Assad has not gained American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights.
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well.
For example, Assad apparently still does not realize how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism.
Syrian officials believe that because the Baath Party is secular, the US will invariably support it against an Islamist resurgence.
They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon.
At home, Assad’s regime also finds itself in a bind.
Political and economic reform, when it advances, does so at a glacial pace.
A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees.
France’s opposition to Syria’s presence in Lebanon was at least partly a reflection of disenchantment with Assad’s reformist ambitions, and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.
Assad is now in a consolidation phase, leaving little room for reform.
Indeed, his new interior minister, Ghazi Kanaan, an old-school hardliner, spearheaded a crackdown on reformers and Kurds in the past year or so.
The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad’s preferences.
In the coming month, several rounds of retirements should allow the president to place more of his people in positions of power.
Consolidation, however, is not reform.
Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation.
Until now, the president has toed a hard line on Iraq, on Lebanon, and in domestic affairs.
If he’s a reformer, few are convinced.
Syria may pay a heavy price for that ambiguity.

King Coal’s Pyrrhic Victory
BRUSSELS – Sometimes the most important news is what is not happening.
This summer has given us one such example: the climate-change bill, for which President Barack Obama had pushed so hard, will not even be presented to the United States Senate, because it stands no chance of passage.
This means that the US is about to repeat its “Kyoto experience.” Twenty years ago, in 1990, the US participated (at least initially) in the first global talks aimed at achieving a global accord to reduce CO2 emissions.
At the time, the European Union and the US were by far the greatest emitters, so it seemed appropriate to exempt the world’s emerging economies from any commitment.
Over time, it became apparent that the US would not live up to its commitment, owing, as now, to opposition in the Senate.
The EU then went ahead on its own, introducing its path-breaking European Emission Trading System in the hope that Europe could lead by example.
Without the American climate-change package, the promises made by the US administration only seven months ago at the Copenhagen summit have become worthless.
The European strategy is in tatters – and not only on the transatlantic front.
China’s commitment to increase the CO2 efficiency of its economy by about 3% per year is of no help, because annual GDP growth rates of close to 10% mean that the country’s emissions will soar during this decade.
Indeed, by 2020, Chinese emissions could be more than triple those of Europe and even surpass those of the US and Europe combined.
Exempting emerging markets from any commitments, as the Kyoto Protocol sought to do, no longer makes sense.
Why has every attempt to set prices for global carbon emissions failed?
The answer can be found in one word: “coal” – or, rather, the fact that coal is cheap and abundant.
Burning hydrocarbons (natural gas and petrol) yields both water and CO2.
By contrast, burning coal yields only C02.
Moreover, compared to natural gas and crude oil, coal is much cheaper per ton of CO2 released.
This implies that any tax on carbon has a much higher impact on coal than on crude oil (or gas).
Owners of coal mines and their clients are thus strongly opposed to any tax on carbon.
They constitute a small but well organized group that wields immense lobbying power to block efforts to limit CO2 emissions by putting a price on them, as the planned US cap-and-trade system would have done.
In Europe, indigenous coal production no longer plays an important economic role.
It is thus not surprising that Europe could enact a cap-and-trade system that imposes a carbon price on a large part of its industry.
Indeed, the tax seems to fall mostly on foreign suppliers of coal (and to a lesser extend on foreign suppliers of hydrocarbons in the Middle East and Russia).
By contrast, opposition by US states whose economies rely significantly on coal production proved decisive for the fate of Obama’s climate-change bill.
The US experience has wider implications.
If it proved impossible to introduce a moderate carbon tax in a rich economy, it is certain that no commitment will be forthcoming for the next generation from China, which remains much poorer and depends even more on indigenous coal than the US.
And, after China, India looms as the next emerging coal-based industrial superpower.
Without any significant commitment from the US, the Copenhagen Accord, so laboriously achieved last year, has become meaningless.
Business will now continue as usual, both in terms of climate-change diplomacy, with its wandering circus of big international meetings, and in terms of rapidly increasing emissions.
The meetings are aimed at creating the impression that the world’s leaders are still working on a solution to the problem.
But rising CO2 emissions constitute what is really happening on the ground: a rapidly growing industrial base in emerging markets is being hard-wired to intensive use of coal.
This will make it exceedingly difficult to reverse the trend in the future.
A planet composed of nation-states that in turn are dominated by special interest groups does not seem capable of solving this problem.
Unfortunately, there is enough cheap coal around to power ever-higher emissions for at least another century.
The world will thus certainly become much warmer.
The only uncertainty is how much warmer that will be.
Determined action at the global level will become possible only when climate change is no longer some scientific prediction, but a reality that people feel.
But, at that point, it will be too late to reverse the impact of decades of excessive emissions.
A world incapable of preventing climate change will have to live with it.

The Fed Versus Price Stability
SAN FRANCISCO – There is a big difference between the Federal Reserve’s mandate to maintain “stable prices” – as enunciated in the Federal Reserve Act – and the Fed’s self-selected target of 2% annual inflation.
So how is it that policymakers have managed to substitute the latter for the former?
The term “stable prices” is self-explanatory: a bundle of goods will cost the same ten, 50, or even 100 years from now.
By contrast, if a country experiences 2% inflation over a ten-year period, the same items that $100 can buy today will cost $122 at the end of the decade. After 100 years, the price tag will be a whopping $724.
In her recent Congressional testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen referred several times to the mandate of maintaining “stable prices”; but she mentioned the Fed’s 2% inflation objective twice as often.
“US inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2% objective,” she said, and the current “high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2% over the medium term.”
Does the Fed really want to increase annual inflation to 2%, such that the price level of the country will increase by more than 700% over the next century?
Is that what Congress had in mind when it tasked the Fed with achieving “stable prices”?
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan knew that it did not.
On July 2, 1996, at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which was devoted to extensive discussion of the appropriate inflation target for the Fed, Greenspan posed a simple question: “Are we talking about price stability or are we talking about zero inflation?” he asked.
“As we all know, those are two separate things.”
The discussion quickly turned to the difficulty of measuring inflation accurately and the need to build in a “safety cushion” to avoid deflation.
According to Greenspan, “Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business and household decisions.”
Yellen, then a Fed governor, was not satisfied: “Could you please put a number on that?” she asked.
Greenspan did: “I would say that number is zero, if inflation is properly measured,” he replied.
At the time of that FOMC meeting, the consumer price index was increasing at about 3% per year. Most of the discussion focused on whether the Fed should slow annual price growth to 2% or even lower, thereby consolidating the gains made in the difficult fight against inflation that policymakers had waged for the previous 15 years.
Greenspan summarized the consensus: “...we have now all agreed on 2%...”
Thus, the Fed’s 2% inflation objective was born.
During the ensuing discussion, several FOMC members argued that the inflation rate might be reduced to less than 2%, but nobody argued that inflation should be pushed higher if a lower, but still positive, rate was achieved.
Following the discussion, Greenspan exhorted the FOMC members to keep the discussion of the inflation target secret. “I will tell you that if the 2% inflation figure gets out of this room,” he warned, “it is going to create more problems for us than I think any of you might anticipate.”
The official minutes of the meeting make no reference to the entire discussion of the inflation target, which took up several hours, and the FOMC never formally announced its 2% target for annual inflation until Chairman Ben Bernanke, Yellen’s predecessor, finally did so in 2012.
The 2% inflation target now is at the forefront of FOMC decision-making.
For example, while annual inflation stood at 0.8% in December 2014, the minutes of the January 2015 FOMC meeting refer several times to the Committee’s need to make “progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation” by maintaining a highly accommodative policy stance.
Increasing the rate of inflation is now the stated objective of Fed policy.
Congress did not give the Fed a mandate to pursue that goal.
The Federal Reserve Act is explicit: the Fed should achieve “price stability” for the US currency, along with moderate interest rates and maximum employment.
As long as inflation is somewhere between zero and 2%, the Fed should declare victory and leave it at that.

Asia’s Age of Thaksin?
The retirements from frontline politics of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysia’s Mahathir Mohamed have deprived Southeast Asia of its senior leaders.
Can Thailand’s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra fill the regional leadership vacuum?
A series of bold foreign-policy strokes – the Asia Cooperation Dialogue, the Economic Cooperation Strategy for the development of mainland Southeast Asia, and America’s designation of Thailand as a “major non-NATO ally” – turned the international spotlight on Thaksin during his first term.
Violence in Thailand’s predominantly Muslim south seemed to dent his ambitions last year, but his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party’s landslide victory last February gave his bid for regional leadership a new lease on life.
With the TRT capturing over 75% of the seats in the lower house of parliament, Thaksin is now politically invincible at home.
Indeed, he has become the first elected Thai leader to finish a four-year term, be re-elected, and preside over a one-party government.
Thaksin’s dominance of Thai politics is unprecedented, and his resilient popularity in the face of a fickle electorate is unparalleled.
Apart from his complete control of domestic politics, Thaksin commands other prerequisites of regional leadership.
Already eyeing a third term, he can count on political longevity on the order of Mahathir’s 22-year rule.
Notwithstanding the one-party system that the TRT is cultivating, Thaksin is armed with democratic legitimacy in a global arena bent on democracy promotion, and he speaks English decently enough to articulate his views and vision to a global audience.
He even has his own development strategy, dubbed “Thaksinomics,” a self-styled approach that blends neo-liberal export-led growth with grassroots-based domestic demand.
The Thai economy emerged out of its post-1997 crisis doldrums under Thaksin’s watch, and is now firmly positioned on a 6% annual growth trajectory.
While it relies on profligate subsidies and cash handouts, Thaksinomics also banks on structural reforms to propel economic growth.
The strategy’s most promising prospects include the promotion of industrial upgrading, niche industries, and competitiveness-boosting cluster projects that aim to make Thailand a global and regional hub for food, fashion, tourism, automobiles, and healthcare.
A vibrant economy – GDP growth is second only to China’s in Asia – is indispensable for regional leadership.
Of the policies that will determine his future role in the region, the Asia Cooperation Dialogue and Economic Cooperation Strategy stand out.
Based on the concept of “Asia for Asians,” the nascent ACD’s membership straddles the Asian landmass from the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East, with Thailand at the geographic center.
Although its future directions are uncertain, this 26-member forum trumps Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and ASEAN Plus Three, which includes China, Japan, and South Korea.
The region-wide crisis in 1997, weak progress on free trade, and the region’s security vulnerabilities have made Thaksin aware of ASEAN’s limitations.
As Indonesia’s size makes it a natural leader of ASEAN, the ACD lends Thaksin a broader platform that stresses Thailand’s geographical advantages.
It allows him to trumpet Thailand’s strategic objectives and the region’s major issues, sometimes in confrontation with the interests and the demands of the West.
Within the ACD framework, Thaksin launched the $1 billion “Asia Bond” last year in an effort to match Asia’s financial capital with its financing requirements.
In a smaller sphere of operations, the ECS envisages economic development in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam.
Under Thaksin, Thailand graduated from aid recipient and became a donor country for the first time, having turned away development assistance from countries like Japan.
A Thai fund of 10 billion baht was established to provide outright aid and soft loans to the ECS members.
Like the ACD, the ECS shifts Thai foreign policy priorities to the Southeast Asian mainland, highlighting Thailand’s role and Thaksin’s canny leadership.
Two major obstacles stand in Thaksin’s way.
The raging violence in southern Thailand over the past 15 months has made him look bad, as his myriad strategies and tactics have failed repeatedly.
Nor have his bluster and ill temper improved matters.
Thaksin initially dismissed the violent attacks as the work of bandits. Only late last year did he admit that southern Muslim separatism was the cause.
Signs of a symbiotic relationship between local separatists and regional terrorists have emerged.
If the attacks widen beyond the three southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat, Thaksin’s regional leadership chances will be dimmed.
Thaksin knows this.
Since his sweeping re-election, he has been surprisingly modest and magnanimous.
He has appointed Anand Panyarachun, a former Thai prime minister who recently headed a United Nations reform panel, to select and direct a blue-ribbon national commission to seek reconciliation with the southern separatists.
In addition, Thaksin will have to do something about Myanmar if the international community is to accept his wider role.
To many, Thai-Myanmar relations are too cozy. Critics accuse Thaksin of conflicts of interest, as his family-owned telecommunications conglomerate holds sizeable investments in Myanmar.
It is now largely up to Thaksin himself. If he is enlightened enough to make amends with disaffected southerners and move beyond his vested interests in Myanmar, he retains a good shot at becoming Asia’s next spokesman.

The High Stakes of the Coming Digital Currency War
SOUTH BEND – Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was at least half right when he recently told the United States Congress that there is no US monopoly on regulation of next-generation payments technology.
You may not like Facebook’s proposed Libra (pseudo) cryptocurrency, Zuckerberg implied, but a state-run Chinese digital currency with global ambitions is perhaps just a few months away, and you will probably like that even less.
Perhaps Zuckerberg went too far when he suggested that the imminent rise of a Chinese digital currency could undermine overall dollar dominance of global trade and finance – at least the large part that is legal, taxed, and regulated.
In fact, US regulators have vast power not only over domestic entities but also over any financial firms that need access to dollar markets, as Europe recently learned to its dismay when the US forced European banks to comply with severe restrictions on doing business with Iran.
America’s deep and liquid markets, its strong institutions, and the rule of law will trump Chinese efforts to achieve currency dominance for a long time to come.
China’s burdensome capital controls, its limits on foreign holdings of bonds and equities, and the general opaqueness of its financial system leave the renminbi many decades away from supplanting the dollar in the legal global economy.
Control over the underground economy, however, is another matter entirely.
The global underground economy, consisting mainly of tax evasion and criminal activities, but also terrorism, is much smaller than the legal economy (perhaps one-fifth the size), but it is still highly consequential.
The issue here is not so much whose currency is dominant, but how to minimize adverse effects.
And a widely used, state-backed Chinese digital currency could certainly have an impact, especially in areas where China’s interests do not coincide with those of the West.
A US-regulated digital currency could in principle be required to be traceable by US authorities, so that if North Korea were to use it to hire Russian nuclear scientists, or Iran were to use it to finance terrorist activity, they would run a high risk of being caught, and potentially even blocked.
If, however, the digital currency were run out of China, the US would have far fewer levers to pull.
Western regulators could ultimately ban the use of China’s digital currency, but that wouldn’t stop it from being used in large parts of Africa, Latin America, and Asia, which in turn could engender some underground demand even in the US and Europe.
One might well ask why existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin cannot already perform this function.
To an extremely limited extent, they do.
But regulators worldwide have huge incentives to rein in cryptocurrencies by sharply proscribing their use in banks and retail establishments.
Such restrictions make existing cryptocurrencies highly illiquid and ultimately greatly limit their fundamental underlying value.
Not so for a Chinese-backed digital renminbi that could readily be spent in one of the world’s two largest economies.
True, when China announces its new digital currency, it will almost surely be “permissioned”: a central clearing house will in principle allow the Chinese government to see anything and everything.
But the US will not.
Facebook’s Libra is also designed as a “permissioned” currency, in its case under the auspices of Swiss regulators.
Cooperation with Switzerland, where the currency is officially registered, will surely be much better than with China, despite Switzerland’s long tradition of extending privacy to financial transactions, especially with regard to tax evasion.
The fact that Libra will be pegged to the US dollar will give US authorities additional insight, because (at present) all dollar clearing must go through US-regulated entities.
Still, given that Libra’s functionality can largely be duplicated with existing financial instruments, it is hard to see much fundamental demand for Libra except among those aiming to evade detection.
Unless tech-sponsored currencies offer genuinely superior technology – and this is not at all obvious – they should be regulated in the same way as everyone else.
If nothing else, Libra has inspired many advanced-economy central banks to accelerate their programs to provide broader-based retail digital currencies, and, one hopes, to strengthen their efforts to boost financial inclusion.
But this battle is not simply over the profits from printing currency; ultimately, it is over the state’s ability to regulate and tax the economy in general, and over the US government’s ability to use the dollar’s global role to advance its international policy aims.
The US currently has financial sanctions in place against 12 countries.
Turkey was briefly sanctioned last month after its invasion of Kurdish territory in Syria, though the measures were quickly lifted.
For Russia, sanctions have been in place for five years.
Just as technology has disrupted media, politics, and business, it is on the verge of disrupting America’s ability to leverage faith in its currency to pursue its broader national interests.
Libra is probably not the answer to the coming disruption posed by government-sanctioned digital currencies from China and elsewhere.
But if not, Western governments need to start thinking about their response now, before it is too late.

No Child Left Out
SEOUL – On a recent visit to a camp for Syrian refugees in Turkey, I witnessed some of the most powerful displays of human endurance that anyone can imagine.
And yet, amid all the stories of trauma and loss, what affected me the most was these refugee families’ unquenchable thirst for education.
The children I spoke to told me of their continued desire to learn in the camp’s makeshift schools, crammed into classes and taught in shifts running from before dawn until after dark.
Their parents spoke of the hope they place in the transformative power of education.
Syria once boasted universal education.
Now, with more than four million people forced to flee their homes because of the violence wracking the country, it has become one of the world’s many places suffering from what can only be described as a global education crisis.
There are an estimated 58 million primary-school-aged children out of school worldwide, and those affected by conflict and natural disasters are among the hardest to reach.
Worse, the number of child refugees cut off from school – in places like Nepal, Myanmar, and Yemen – is increasing at an alarming rate.
If the international community does not act to nurture and educate these children, the cycle of poverty and conflict will be reproduced for generations to come.
The fact that so many children are cut off from education constitutes a clear failure on the part of the world’s governments, which promised in 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, to ensure primary schooling for all children by 2015.
To achieve this, it is not enough to enroll children in school; they must be kept there and provided a quality education.
UNESCO estimates that at least 250 million of the world’s children of primary-school age are unable to read, write, or do basic arithmetic.
This week, the international community will have a chance to do something about this scandalous state of affairs.
Policymakers from around the world will meet in South Korea at the World Education Forum to agree on the global education targets that are set to replace the MDGs.
It is truly fitting that South Korea is hosting this forum, because it is so often seen as a model of what investment in education can deliver.
Some 8% of South Korea’s GDP is spent on education, and UNESCO estimates that every dollar invested in primary schools generates $10-$15 in economic returns.
South Korea, which has lifted itself up from the ranks of the world’s poorest countries to among its richest in just two generations, is living proof that education pays off.
The new Sustainable Development Goals that are to be agreed this year underscore the challenges that world governments must address by 2030.
I insist that quality universal primary education must be one of the SDGs’ top priorities.
The emphasis here is on quality.
Success is measured not only by the number of children we enroll, nor by their achievements on standardized tests; the most important outcomes are the tangible and intangible impacts of education on the quality of students’ lives.
This is the unfinished business of the MDGs.
Wherever I travel with the Education Above All foundation, I encounter bright, motivated children who have been denied the chance to learn.
As the world moves on to new priorities, we cannot forget our responsibility to those who have been failed by our complacency.
The job is not done.
We must remain committed to achieving the goal of quality primary education for all children – not some, and not even most – wherever they live.

The Siren Song of Scranton
MILAN – The Great Lockdown in response to COVID-19 has altered billions of people’s perception of geographic space.
For weeks, social and professional interactions were mediated by digital technologies that compressed physical distance and blurred the boundaries between the digital world and the real one.
This unprecedented socioeconomic experiment is likely to have lasting effects, potentially transforming many aspects of our lives, and ultimately inducing people to rethink where they want to reside.
The hierarchy of urban core and periphery, predominant in the Western world since the first Industrial Revolution, could be upended.
Economists have long tried to understand what makes cities so special.
Over a century ago, Alfred Marshall argued in Principles of Economics that proximity creates an ideal atmosphere for firms operating in the same industry.
As he put it, there is something “in the air” that allows ideas to flow freely from one firm to another, continuously inspiring new inventions through a process of imitation and innovation.
Moreover, manufacturers within the same district tend to have ready access to a large pool of skilled labor and specialized suppliers of intermediate inputs.
Of course, historically, entrepreneurs did not choose at random where to locate.
Though they benefited from the proximity of peers, they also wanted to minimize their costs by locating close to the markets where their key inputs were produced or their products were sold – or somewhere in between.
For his part, Marshall was thinking about Victorian-era manufacturing hubs like the Lancashire textile district in northwest England, where climatic conditions were ideal for producing cotton goods.
In the United States, meatpackers clustered in Chicago, because that was the conduit through which cows and pigs were shipped from the agrarian west to the urban east.
Inevitably, as a city flourishes and attracts more talent and capital, many other cities become less economically relevant.
That is why there have always been clearly discernible urban hierarchies, which in turn correspond to disparities in wealth.
But this pattern is not uniform across the board.
In a highly centralized country like France, for example, most economic activities are concentrated in Paris, whereas in a federal country like Germany, they are more evenly distributed across regions.
In any case, large cities have continued to prosper and grow, even as globalization and the decline in transportation costs have led many firms to diffuse their production capacity around the world.
The reason for this continued urban expansion is simple: knowledge-based jobs in technological and financial hubs depend to a large extent on face-to-face interactions that allow those who hold them to stay ahead of the curve.
This is why patents are positively correlated with city size.
But new technologies could well reduce the incentive to cluster, thereby altering urban hierarchies.
Digital platforms, in particular, provide opportunities for remote social and professional interactions.
Teleconferencing, virtual collaboration tools, dating apps, and many other innovations have all proven effective in reaping some of the benefits of agglomeration from a distance.
The potential, apparent before the pandemic, now is being realized on a massive scale.
If demand for face-to-face encounters were to decline permanently, the agglomeration costs of crowded, polluted, expensive cities could start to outweigh the benefits, pushing even qualified professionals toward smaller towns, where they would enjoy greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living.
After all, many of the professional and leisure opportunities that make cities like Paris, New York, and London unique are disproportionately enjoyed by a small elite with the means for discretionary spending.
It is this narrow cohort that has the strongest incentive to keep such cities populated.
To be sure, a structural shift away from highly concentrated megacities would have no historical precedent.
In the past, when people left a declining city, it was to follow the capital and job opportunities to the next major hub.
But now, the movement could run in the opposite direction: from rich urban areas to economically depressed ones, where those with disposable income can enjoy a significantly better life while maintaining jobs that are headquartered elsewhere.
This would represent not just a rearrangement but also a flattening of traditional urban hierarchies.
This is not to suggest that the “death of the city,” or anything like it, is on the horizon.
Virtual life will never be a perfect substitute for the real thing, and most of the movement would not be toward a hermit-like existence in the countryside but rather to smaller and mid-size towns.
Moreover, labor markets will still impose hard limits.
As of now, roughly one-third of jobs in the US and Europe can be performed remotely, and many are in professions that will still benefit from the networking effects offered by vibrant urban areas.
Ultimately, the cities where the jobs are formally based will retain relatively more economic power than other locations.
Nonetheless, even a partial, gradual repopulation of less-developed areas could bring far-reaching benefits, not least by helping to close regional divides that have been exploited by populist politicians across Western countries in recent years.
According to economist Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, the introduction of one high-skilled job in a local economy tends to create at least five lower-skilled jobs, thereby helping to raise living standards for all living in the same area.
Thus, over time, the inflow of skilled workers into previously marginalized cities could create more dynamic and resilient local economies, preparing the ground for a more geographically and socioeconomically balanced growth model.
Governments should seek to facilitate such a transition by building adequate digital infrastructure in peripheral areas, providing tax credits for relocation, and expanding the incentives for remote-working arrangements.
In Europe, where thousands of towns with centuries of history have been completely depopulated, the benefits of such policies would be enormous – not least that they would reduce geographic disparities far more effectively than imposing higher taxes on the urban elite would.
Until a few months ago, megacities were the future.
But in a post-pandemic world, the medium-size town will have much to recommend it.

Accelerating Africa’s Energy Transition
PARIS – For much of Africa, the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy is seen as an environmental imperative.
With fossil fuels comprising a majority – as high as 70% in some cases – of the energy mix, the situation on the continent is indeed ecologically dire.
But Africa’s energy transition is economically urgent as well.
Each year, oil subsidies consume 1.5% of the continent’s GDP – roughly $50 billion.
That is enough money to provide solar power to some 300 million people.
If the continent could rebalance its energy portfolio, moving away from hydrocarbons slowly, those subsidies could be reallocated in ways that would yield both environmental and economic benefits.
Today, neither oil exporters nor importers are adequately insulated from price shocks.
When oil prices declined rapidly in 2015, for example, Africa’s energy importers spent less on oil, while exporting countries suffered financially.
When prices rebounded, the relationship switched: energy-exporting countries’ revenues inched up, while importing countries struggled to maintain consumption levels.
This is a needless cycle. Integrating cleaner power into national energy systems would not only raise local capacities; it would also free up hydrocarbons for export.
The resulting revenue could then be invested into new forms of greener power.
Such a transition, which would require cooperation with the oil sector, promises to boost socioeconomic progress.
Among the biggest benefits would be the electrification of areas that, under current distribution systems, are literally in the dark.
Today, just 30% of Africa has access to reliable electricity.
But, with a total capacity estimated at around ten terawatts, installed solar capacity in Africa could broaden access dramatically.
In fact, according to some estimates, the increase in solar generation by 2030 could range from 15 to 62 gigawatts.
Fossil fuels are not destined to be phased out anytime soon, but an energy mix that included a significant increase in solar power would have major economic advantages for Africa, especially in areas where agriculture is the largest economic sector.
Electrifying agricultural areas would facilitate the storage and transportation of farmed products, improve food security, and increase farmers’ earning capacity.
In the drive to rebalance Africa’s energy mix, the continent maintains one crucial advantage over developed economies: a clean slate.
The relative absence of legacy investments is the principal reason why green power is Africa’s best energy option.
Although every country must balance its own energy needs, reliance on renewable sources, and solar power in particular, is the most cost-efficient strategy for fostering rapid economic development throughout the continent.
Evidence of this potential can be found in the few photovoltaic power plants that have begun operating in Africa.
For example, the Senergy 2 solar plant in Senegal sells electricity to the Senegalese power utility at a price that lowers the cost of the energy mix by 50%.
Similar solar solutions are being implemented by African telecoms to electrify communication towers.
The best way to accelerate the transition from hydrocarbons to greener forms of energy would be to redirect a portion of national oil subsidies to renewables.
This would create stronger incentives to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, while encouraging investment and growth in green-energy output.
For Africa’s rural regions, moreover, such policies would help bring communities out of darkness and lead to the installation of other critical infrastructure that economic growth requires.
But while renewables hold the key to Africa’s long-term prosperity, the continent’s transition to cleaner power should not lead to an immediate, full-scale repudiation of hydrocarbons.
The oil sector will still have an important role to play.
The industry’s experience on the continent will be needed to navigate the energy transformation.
And, because fossil fuels will remain part of the continent’s energy mix, the oil sector must be encouraged to clean up its own act.
This may sound like an impossible alliance.
But as policymakers across the continent seek to secure adequate supplies of clean energy to ensure rapid, inclusive economic growth and environmental sustainability, they are likely to find that there is no alternative.
Cooperation between old and new energy industries may be the only engine that is capable of powering Africa forward.

Breaking the Middle East’s Cycle of Terror
FEZ – In July, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that the Islamic State (ISIS) had been driven out of Mosul, the country’s second-largest city, which it captured three years ago.
Sooner or later, it will also lose Raqqa, the capital of its self-styled caliphate – and the last true city under its control.
But these defeats do not mean the downfall of ISIS, much less Islamist terrorism, or that the Middle East’s most acute conflicts will be resolved anytime soon.
To be sure, the fading dream of an Islamic caliphate will weaken the ability of ISIS and kindred groups to recruit disaffected youth.
Already, the flow of foreign would-be jihadists crossing from Turkey into Syria to join ISIS has plunged, from 2,000 per month to about 50.
But such groups still have powerful lures at their disposal.
Most fundamentally, they are able to offer disillusioned young people a sense of purpose and belonging.
The fact that this purpose entails murder, terror, and mayhem may make it all the more appealing among frustrated and resentful youth.
Despite recent setbacks, writing off the threat posed by ISIS is as unwarranted as it is premature.
Consider the history of al-Qaeda, which proves that even if a state that nourishes a terrorist group fails, a radical ideology can continue to fuel violence near and far.
The group’s leaders must simply adjust their methods, in order to continue attracting recruits and planning attacks from outside the borders of a friendly sovereign state.
To that end, in Iraq, terrorist groups will continue to exploit sectarianism, which had divided the country long before the United States invaded it in 2003.
More broadly, they can capitalize on escalating tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims to attract alienated young Sunnis.
This increasingly dangerous dynamic is apparent in the decision of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, owing to its alleged ties with regional terrorist groups and Iran, Saudi Arabia’s main rival for regional influence.
It is also visible in the devastating proxy war in Yemen, which has become a key battleground in the Saudi-Iranian power struggle.
Against this background, it seems likely that ISIS, from its scattered bases in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, will be able to continue planning and executing terrorist attacks in the Middle East and beyond.
But there are ways to avoid such an outcome – or at least minimize the damage.
For starters, governments and non-governmental actors in the Arab world must sever all financial ties to terrorist groups.
Beyond official transfers, this means halting private efforts by individual citizens to fund terror.
States in the region already have harsh legal codes; governments should enforce them more effectively against those who finance terror.
At the same time, religious and political leaders must loudly condemn the violent Islamist ideology that nurtures jihadist movements, spurning them with the same vigor that they reserve for challengers to their own authority.
Qui tacet consentire videtur (silence means consent).
In this case, tacit consent emboldens terrorist actors, with deadly results.
The countries of the Middle East have become associated with extremist ideologies and terror the world over.
If they are to recover their reputations, and restore the health of their societies and economies, they must act decisively to weaken the allure of terrorist recruiters.
Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have all made some moves in this direction, but they cannot do it alone.
Like these countries, others in the Middle East must not allow themselves to be lulled into complacency by the ostensible fall of ISIS as a territorial entity.
Ultimately, the only way to break the cycle of terror and violence in the Arab world is to resolve the conflicts within Islam.
To reach that point, however, the region’s governments must urgently pursue a two-prong strategy of interdiction and condemnation.

Turkey’s Nation of Faiths
ANKARA – After decades of official neglect and mistrust, Turkey has taken several steps to ensure the rights of the country’s non-Muslim religious minorities, and thus to guarantee that the rule of law is applied equally for all Turkish citizens, regardless of individuals’ religion, ethnicity, or language.
Turkey’s religious minorities include Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Assyrian, Kaldani, and other Christian denominations, as well as Jews, all of whom are integral parts of Turkish society.
As part of the Turkish government’s new initiative to end any sort of discrimination against these non-Muslim communities, President Abdullah Gül has emphasized that message by receiving Bartholemew, the Greek-Orthodox Patriarch of Istanbul, and by visiting a church and a synagogue in Hatay – a first by a Turkish president.
In August 2009, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with leaders of religious minorities on Büyükada, the largest of the Prince Islands in the Sea of Marmara, and listened to their problems and concerns, a clear signal of his government’s intent to buttress their sense of civil inclusion.
As Deputy Prime Minister, I met with representatives of religious minorities in March 2010, and visited the Armenian and Greek Orthodox Patriarchies in 2010 and 2011.
Likewise, Turkey’s minister for European Union affairs, Egemen Bağış, has met with these communities’ leaders on several occasions.
Beyond establishing warm relations between the Turkish government and the country’s religious minorities, official policy has been changing as well.
In May 2010, Prime Minister Erdoğan issued an official statement that warned public servants and citizens against any discrimination against religious minorities, and that emphasized the absolute equality of Turkey’s non-Muslim citizens.
But the groundwork for the initiative of recent years was laid long before.
In August 2003, the Erdoğan-led government introduced legal changes to resolve property-rights issues related to religious minority associations.
For the first time in the Republic’s history, 365 landholdings and buildings belonging to the minority communities were legally registered under their name.
In 2008, the government, despite fierce opposition from other political parties, changed the Law of Associations and allowed religious-minority associations to purchase real estate (and to receive contributions, regardless of size, from abroad).
Then, in August 2011, an important amendment to the Associations law mandated the return of more than 350 properties to religious minorities.
As part of these changes, the Greek-Orthodox Girls School in Beyoğlu, Istanbul, and the Jewish Community Center in Izmir have been granted legal status, ending a century-old dispute.
Even before that, in November 2010, the Greek-Orthodox Orphanage on Halki Island was returned to the Greek-Orthodox Patriarchy.
In order to facilitate their religious duties, the Orthodox metropolitans were granted Turkish citizenship.
Furthermore, the Associations Council, the country’s highest authority on religious associations, now includes for the first time a non-Muslim member representing minority faiths.
Moreover, the Directorate-General of Associations has been charged with the task of renovating houses of worship used by religious minorities, including the historic Aya Nikola Church in Gökçeada Çanakkale, and the Assyrian Catholic Church and Greek Catholic Church in Iskenderun.
A number of other churches and synagogues are also under renovation.
The authorities have taken many other historically and symbolically important steps as well.
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism has renovated the Panagia Sümela Monastery, a 1,600-year-old church in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast.
The first mass in decades was held in August 2010, led by Bartholomew and attended by hundreds of worshippers from Greece, Russia, Georgia, Europe, the United States, and Turkey.
Another milestone was the renovation and opening of the 1,100-year old Armenian Aghtamar Church in March 2007.
The first mass in 95 years was held in the church, led by the Armenian Archbishop Aram Ateşyan and attended by thousands of worshippers.
These measures have been taken to address the long-standing problems of Turkey’s non-Muslim religious minorities.
Turkish Muslims have lived with Jewish and Christian communities for centuries and treated them with respect and compassion.
We are determined to solve their remaining problems, and we believe that we can do so through mutual trust and cooperation.
Turkey’s Jews and Christians are full citizens with equal rights, and we will work to ensure that this reality is recognized in all areas of the country’s life.

Is Post-Brexit London Really Doomed?
EDINBURGH – It is now well over three years since the United Kingdom voted, by a narrow but significant margin, to leave the European Union.
Yet we still have no idea what kind of economic relationship the UK will have with the 27 countries it leaves behind.
(Some of the debate in London recalls in its insularity the apocryphal 1930s headline: “Fog in Channel: Continent Cut Off.”) Insofar as one can hazard a guess, the most likely outcome seems to be a more remote relationship than “Leave” supporters talked about in the referendum campaign and than most commentators envisaged shortly after the vote.
But, despite that change of direction, and the certain loss of the so-called passport, which would allow financial services to be sold freely across the EU, the feared large-scale exodus of firms and financiers from London does not seem to be under way.
The French bakeries and German sausage shops are still doing a roaring trade.
Why?
Two very recent pieces of evidence give a sense of what is happening on the ground, while politicians continue to argue.
The accounting firm EY has monitored firms’ declared intentions in response to Brexit over the last three years. The latest survey, published in mid-September, indicates that 40% of firms plan to move some of their operations and staff out of London, while 60% of larger firms have announced such moves.
But the number of jobs that are to be moved from London to another European city is now only 7,000, far lower than estimates made a couple of years ago.
Interestingly, the two locations that, according to EY, have benefited most so far are Dublin and Luxembourg.
That is good news for London, because both are niche centers and unlikely to emerge as powerful rivals across the full spectrum of financial activities.
Had Paris and Frankfurt been the principal beneficiaries, the long-term consequences could be far more threatening.
Their marketing campaigns are so far yielding only modest returns.
There is, however, some more worrying news for London in the survey.
Firms confirm that they are likely to move assets out of the UK on a large scale.
The latest estimate is that around £1 trillion ($1.2 trillion) of assets under management may move to other centers when the UK leaves the EU.
Many employees who are responsible for these assets will remain in London for now, but that could change over time.
And a second data point suggests that London’s reputation is beginning to suffer.
A consultancy called Z/Yen has published a Global Financial Centres Index every six months for more than a decade. The latest ranking, in mid-September, showed that while London remains second only to New York globally, its relative position has been slipping.
New York’s lead has more than doubled in the last six months.
London’s relative decline has been sharper than any other of the top centers, and Paris has moved up.
Indeed, the gap between London and Paris has fallen to 45 points from 88 points in March (the top mark is just below 800).
The European Banking Authority’s move to Paris, and Bank of America’s decision to relocate its euro trading there, are probably the main factors behind that change of perception.
Moving from survey to anecdote, managers say they have found it harder than expected to persuade senior staff to move.
Even Italians and French who have been asked to relocate back to Milan or Paris are often reluctant to agree.
Their children are settled in school, their spouse or partner has a non-mobile job in London, or they can’t bear to find themselves so close again to Mom and Dad!
More significantly, perhaps, a global market is a complex ecosystem.
The traders may move, but will the IT infrastructure and support be as sophisticated elsewhere as it is in London?
Will skilled consultants and lawyers be available on demand, as they are in the Square Mile?
These factors are making firms hesitant about large-scale moves.
Instead, many have been looking for workarounds to overcome the regulatory problems they will certainly encounter once the UK leaves the single market.
Moreover, the politics of Brexit remain fraught and complex, and there is a small chance that the UK will hold another referendum and reverse course, which would render nugatory the £4.2 billion that the government vowed to spend on contingency plans.
But the most likely outcome is that the UK stumbles toward the exit and falls untidily over the threshold, without a structural new relationship or a lengthy transition period.
Thereafter, we will see how Europe’s financial markets evolve.
But the central expectation, given what we have seen so far, must be that Europe will migrate to a multi-polar financial model, with different centers, small and large, exploiting their respective comparative advantages.
Dublin and Luxembourg will strengthen their positions, especially in asset management.
The European Central Bank will act as a pole of attraction for Frankfurt.
Euro-denominated transactions will increasingly take place in the eurozone, while London looks likely to remain, for the foreseeable future, Europe’s window on the wider world.
There will be a price to pay for users of financial services, as a dominant single center is almost certainly more efficient and cheaper.
But, after Brexit, that solution will no longer be available in London, and there is certainly no consensus among the other 27 countries on a single alternative.

My Speech to the Finance Graduates
NEW HAVEN – At this time of year, at graduation ceremonies in America and elsewhere, those about to leave university often hear some final words of advice before receiving their diplomas.
To those interested in pursuing careers in finance – or related careers in insurance, accounting, auditing, law, or corporate management – I submit the following address:
Best of luck to you as you leave the academy for your chosen professions in finance.
Over the course of your careers, Wall Street and its kindred institutions will need you.
Your training in financial theory, economics, mathematics, and statistics will serve you well.
But your lessons in history, philosophy, and literature will be just as important, because it is vital not only that you have the right tools, but also that you never lose sight of the purposes and overriding social goals of finance.
Unless you have been studying at the bottom of the ocean, you know that the financial sector has come under severe criticism – much of it justified – for thrusting the world economy into its worst crisis since the Great Depression.
And you need only check in with some of your classmates who have populated the Occupy movements around the world to sense the widespread resentment of financiers and the top 1% of income earners to whom they largely cater (and often belong).
While some of this criticism may be over-stated or misplaced, it nonetheless underscores the need to reform financial institutions and practices.
Finance has long been central to thriving market democracies, which is why its current problems need to be addressed.
With your improved sense of our interconnectedness and diverse needs, you can do that.
Indeed, it is the real professional challenge ahead of you, and you should embrace it as an opportunity.
Young finance professionals need to familiarize themselves with the history of banking, and recognize that it is at its best when it serves ever-broadening spheres of society.
Here, the savings-bank movement in the United Kingdom and Europe in the nineteenth century, and the microfinance movement pioneered by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in the twentieth century, comes to mind.
Today, the best way forward is to update financial and communications technology to offer a full array of enlightened banking services to the lower middle class and the poor.
Graduates going into mortgage banking are faced with a different, but equally vital, challenge: to design new, more flexible loans that will better help homeowners to weather the kind of economic turbulence that has buried millions of people today in debt.
Young investment bankers, for their part, have a great opportunity to devise more participatory forms of venture capital – embodied in the new crowd-funding Web sites – to spur the growth of innovative new small businesses.
Meanwhile, opportunities will abound for rookie insurance professionals to devise new ways to hedge risks that real people worry about, and that really matter – those involving their jobs, livelihoods, and home values.
Beyond investment banks and brokerage houses, modern finance has a public and governmental dimension, which clearly needs reinventing in the wake of the recent financial crisis.
Setting the rules of the game for a robust, socially useful financial sector has never been more important.
Recent graduates are needed in legislative and administrative agencies to analyze the legal infrastructure of finance, and regulate it so that it produces the greatest results for society.
A new generation of political leaders needs to understand the importance of financial literacy and find ways to supply citizens with the legal and financial advice that they need.
Meanwhile, economic policymakers face the great challenge of designing new financial institutions, such as pension systems and public entitlements based on the solid grounding of intergenerational risk-sharing.
Those of you deciding to pursue careers as economists and finance scholars need to develop a better understanding of asset bubbles – and better ways to communicate this understanding to the finance profession and to the public.
As much as Wall Street had a hand in the current crisis, it began as a broadly held belief that housing prices could not fall – a belief that fueled a full-blown social contagion.
Learning how to spot such bubbles and deal with them before they infect entire economies will be a major challenge for the next generation of finance scholars.
Equipped with sophisticated financial ideas ranging from the capital asset pricing model to intricate options-pricing formulas, you are certainly and justifiably interested in building materially rewarding careers.
There is no shame in this, and your financial success will reflect to a large degree your effectiveness in producing strong results for the firms that employ you.
But, however imperceptibly, the rewards for success on Wall Street, and in finance more generally, are changing, just as the definition of finance must change if is to reclaim its stature in society and the trust of citizens and leaders.
Finance, at its best, does not merely manage risk, but also acts as the steward of society’s assets and an advocate of its deepest goals.
Beyond compensation, the next generation of finance professionals will be paid its truest rewards in the satisfaction that comes with the gains made in democratizing finance – extending its benefits into corners of society where they are most needed.
This is a new challenge for a new generation, and will require all of the imagination and skill that you can bring to bear.
Good luck in reinventing finance.
The world needs you to succeed.

Restoring Yesterday's Hope for Tomorrow's World
WASHINGTON, DC – The year 2015 was difficult, punctuated by declining growth forecasts, horrific terror attacks, massive refugee flows, and serious political challenges, with populism on the rise in many countries.
In the Middle East, in particular, chaos and violence has continued to proliferate, with devastating consequences.
This represents a disappointing turn from the undoubtedly flawed, but far more hopeful world of just a few decades ago.
In his autobiography The World of Yesterday, Stefan Zweig described a similarly drastic change.
Born in 1881 in Vienna, Zweig spent his youth in an optimistic, civil, and tolerant environment.
Then, starting in 1914, he witnessed Europe’s collapse into World War I, followed by revolutionary convulsions, the Great Depression, the rise of Stalinism, and finally the barbarism of Nazism and the outbreak of World War II.
Devastated, Zweig committed suicide while in exile in 1942.
One imagines that Zweig would have been comforted by the post-WWII creation of the United Nations and the Bretton-Woods system, not to mention the subsequent decades of reconstruction and reconciliation.
He could have witnessed the cooperation and progress that marked the post-war era.
Perhaps, then, he would have looked at the period from 1914 to 1945 as a terrible but limited detour in the world’s march toward peace and prosperity.
Of course, the second half of the twentieth century was far from perfect.
Until 1990, peace was secured largely by the threat of mutual nuclear destruction.
Local conflicts, such as in Korea, Vietnam, parts of Africa, and the Middle East, took their toll.
And while about 100 developing countries gained independence, the process was not always peaceful.
At the same time, however, the world economy grew more rapidly than ever.
A strong middle class emerged in the advanced countries, and then began to appear elsewhere.
The Western democracies and Japan built economies in which productivity growth led to shared prosperity; governments engaged in regulation and redistribution, while private companies fueled growth by implementing technologically advanced production methods.
On both the regional and global levels, decisive progress was made in reaping the benefits from trade and economies of scale.
The European integration project seemed to herald a new kind of cooperation, which could extend to other regions and even influence global cooperation.
The generation that came of age in the 1960s felt much like Zweig had felt in his youth.
We believed that, though progress may not be linear, we could count on it.
We expected an increasingly peaceful and tolerant world, in which technological advances, together with well-governed markets, would generate ever-expanding prosperity.
In 1989, when the Soviet Union was poised to collapse and China was shifting to a market-based economy, Francis Fukuyama announced the “end of history.”
Over the last two decades, however, our hopes – political, social, and economic – have been repeatedly dashed.
There was a time when US policymakers were wondering whether Russia should join NATO.
That possibility is difficult even to consider today, after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea (apparently carried out in response to fears that Ukraine would deepen its ties with the European Union and NATO).
Many emerging economies achieved rapid growth for years – even decades – enabling billions of people to escape extreme poverty and reducing the wealth gap between developed and developing countries.
But that growth has lately slowed substantially, leading many to question whether economists spoke too soon when we labeled them the new engines of global economic growth.
Likewise, the Arab Spring in 2011 was supposed to herald a new, more democratic future for the Middle East and North Africa.
While Tunisia has averted disaster, most of the other affected countries have ended up mired in chaos, with Syria’s brutal civil war facilitating the rise of the Islamic State.
The euro, meanwhile, suffered its own crisis.
The common currency, once portrayed as the start of a quasi-federal Europe, instead created serious tension between “creditor” and “debtor” countries when many debtors faced a protracted economic downturn.
Just as Europe seemed finally to be escaping the euro crisis, refugees, especially from Syria, began flooding in.
That has jeopardized the Schengen Area of borderless travel, and some are asking whether the EU can withstand the pressure.
In the United States, the Syrian refugee crisis has led Congress to rush to restrict visa-free entrance for tourists from 38 countries.
This comes at a time when income and wealth inequality is skyrocketing in the US – the median wage for men has not increased in decades – leaving many to wonder whether their children will be able to maintain the living standard they enjoyed.
On top of all this, for the first time in decades, the growth of international trade no longer comfortably exceeds the growth of global output.
A fundamental driver of many of these problems may well be the unprecedented speed of change – driven by globalization and technological innovation – which has produced disruptions too quickly and on too large a scale for us to manage.
For example, while communication technology has done wonders, say, to expand access to finance in Africa, it has also enabled terrorist networks to encrypt their communications effectively.
And as the global financial crisis starkly demonstrated, regulators have struggled to keep pace with financial innovation.
The potential for human progress still seems immense, because the world wants for neither resources nor technological innovation.
Indeed, technology offers the hope of lifesaving medical treatments, higher economic productivity, and sustainable energy systems.
But people are fearful, as shown by the return of identity politics and a lack of economic and political inclusiveness.
As a result, productivity growth is slowing, and, though capital seems cheap and profits plentiful, investment remains sluggish.
The key to managing the disruptions and assuaging people’s fears is governance.
Zweig saw the world fall apart a century ago not because human knowledge stopped advancing, but because of widespread governance and policy failures.
As we enter 2016, we must focus on adapting governance, in all of its economic and political dimensions, to the twenty-first century, so that our resources and knowledge produce inclusive progress, not violent conflict.

The G-20’s New Thinking For the Global Economy
NEW YORK – The Seoul G-20 summit was notable for the increasing political weight of the emerging economies.
Not only was it located in one, but, in many ways, it was also dominated by them.
In two crucial areas, macroeconomics and global economic development, the emerging economies’ view prevailed.
And an excellent proposal to link the two agendas – macroeconomics and development – emerged from the summit, and should be implemented in 2011.
A key feature of the world economy today is that it is running at two speeds.
The United States and much of Europe remain mired in the aftermath of the financial crisis that erupted in the fall of 2008, with high unemployment, slow economic growth, and continuing bank-sector problems.
Emerging markets, however, have generally surmounted the crisis.
Whereas 2009 was a tough year for the entire global economy, emerging markets bounced back strongly in 2010, while rich countries did not.
Recent data from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook tell the story.
During 2010, high-income countries are expected to achieve modest annual GDP growth of around 2.7%, while the G-20’s emerging economies, together with the rest of the developing world, are expected to grow at a robust 7.1% rate.
Asia’s developing economies are soaring, with 9.4% growth.
Latin America is expected to grow at 5.7%.
Even sub-Saharan Africa, the traditional laggard, is expected to grow at 5% in 2010.
This two-speed global economy largely reflects the fact that the 2008 financial crisis began with over-borrowing by the rich countries themselves.
Two high-income economies got themselves into trouble.
The US, where consumers – assisted by reckless lending to non-creditworthy households – had borrowed heavily to buy houses and cars, was the main culprit.
The periphery of the European Union – Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Greece – also began a borrowing binge a decade ago, upon joining the euro, fueling a real-estate boom that likewise went bust.
Emerging economies, for the most part, avoided this disastrous over-borrowing. One reason, certainly, was the vivid memory in Asia of the 1997 financial crisis, which underscored the need for limits on bank borrowing and capital inflows.
By and large, Asian emerging economies were more prudently managed during the past decade.
The same can be said about Brazil, which learned from its own crisis in 1999, as well as Africa and other regions.
In the run-up to the Seoul summit, the US government put forward a proposal that the surplus regions of the world should increase their domestic demand – mainly consumption – to boost imports and thereby help the deficit regions (including the US) to recover.
The G-20’s emerging economies were not impressed.
Their answer was straightforward: the crisis began with US over-borrowing, so it is America’s responsibility, not theirs, to clean up the mess.
The US should cut its budget deficit, increase its saving rate, and generally get its own house in order.
The emerging economies reacted similarly to a second US initiative, the Federal Reserve’s so-called “quantitative easing.” Emerging economies once again spoke nearly in unison.
They told the US not to boost the money supply artificially, as this would create the risk of yet another financial bubble, this time in the emerging economies and in commodity markets.
Once again, the clear message to the US was to stop using gimmicks like fiscal stimulus or printing money and instead undertake a serious longer-term economic restructuring to boost saving, investment, and net exports.
For their part, emerging economies wanted to change the subject from short-term macroeconomic stimulus and imbalances to longer-term development issues.
The host government, South Korea, was especially dynamic here.
South Korea called on the G-20’s members to focus on challenges such as meeting the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals, raising agricultural production, and building sustainable infrastructure in developing economies.
This was the first time that long-term development issues had been put so clearly on the G-20 agenda, and it is a sign of the growing geopolitical weight of the group’s emerging-market members.
The result of the deliberations is a new framework for the G-20’s engagement with the rest of the developing countries, known as the Seoul Development Consensus for Shared Growth.
The G-20 rightly decided to focus on those areas of the global development agenda where the major economies have a comparative advantage: financing of infrastructure such as roads and power; business development; and support for agricultural upgrading in the poorer countries.
Other parts of the development agenda – for example, health and education – will not be the G-20’s focus.
The new G-20 development agenda offers an excellent way to merge concerns about global imbalances with the need to accelerate the pace of development in the poorer countries.
The US has been pushing China, Germany, Japan, and others to raise consumption in order to boost demand.
But there is a better way to put these surplus countries’ high saving rates to use.
Rather than pushing their households to consume more, the G-20 should work harder to channel these savings to the poorest countries in order to finance urgently needed investments in infrastructure.
India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put the matter perfectly. He noted that sub-Saharan Africa is now in a position to absorb more capital inflows to build infrastructure.
He recommended that G-20 surpluses be recycled to those countries, and to other poor countries, to finance such investments. “In other words,” said Singh, “we should leverage imbalances of one kind to redress imbalances of the other kind.”
By channeling the savings of China, Germany, Japan, and other surplus countries into infrastructure investments in the poor countries, the world’s economies truly would be working in harmony.
The G-20 Seoul Summit may well have initiated that important process.

Germany's Chinese Kowtow
STANFORD – The Greens and the Free Democratic Party, the kingmakers of Germany’s prospective three-party coalition government, favor confronting China over its human-rights abuses in Xinjiang and its crackdown in Hong Kong.
Despite this, Germany’s authoritarian-friendly China policies are unlikely to change when Olaf Scholz, the Social Democratic Party leader who is expected to succeed outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, takes office.
This is because Germany is simply too hooked on exports to China to take a tougher stance on the country’s appalling human-rights record.
One in three German cars is sold in China.
In 2019, Volkswagen sold nearly 40% of its vehicles in the country, while Mercedes-Benz sold about 700,000 passenger cars there.
Even within Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, many are critical of her for allowing Germany’s dependence on China for exports, jobs, and incomes to reach such a point.
There is an old adage that when you owe the bank a million, the bank owns you, but when you owe it a billion, you own the bank.
Similarly, China can be said to “own” German foreign policy because of the German economy’s dependence on exports.
Germany does the exporting, and those persecuted by the Chinese regime do the suffering.
Ironically, Germany’s conciliatory policies toward China are also bad for the German economy, because they keep locked up in exports resources that could be used more productively in public investment, digital technologies, and environmental protection – areas that Merkel neglected.
Germany needs a high-tech, digitalized, green economy to compete and prosper in the twenty-first century, but its pro-China foreign policy facilitates an old-fashioned mercantilist model.
The Greens recognize the shortcomings of Germany remaining an “export champion.”
But Scholz, who is said to prefer a deep economic relationship with China, is likely to side with Germany’s strong trade unions and traditional business interests in favoring the status quo.
Moreover, with Chinese President Xi Jinping becoming increasingly assertive, the German government’s kowtow to China is forcing its European Union partners to choose between European and transatlantic unity – promoting fractures within the Union itself.
And EU member states that side with Germany for reasons of European solidarity risk finding themselves in hot water with the United States, which, under President Joe Biden, is engaged in an intense effort to compete with and contain China.
In late 2020, for example, France chose European unity when, over the objections of then-President-elect Biden’s foreign-policy transition team, it backed Merkel’s sweetheart EU investment agreement with China (which the European Parliament has since blocked).
France may have paid the price for placing European unity above the transatlantic alliance when the US, the United Kingdom, and Australia announced their new AUKUS security agreement, which led Australia to cancel a contract worth nearly $100 billion to buy conventionally powered French submarines.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described Australia’s decision to abandon its deal with France, in favor of nuclear-powered subs under AUKUS, as a “stab in the back,” and a nasty rift developed between France and the US that worked mainly to China’s benefit.
French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden settled their disagreement on the eve of the recent G20 leaders’ summit in Rome.
In an in-person mea culpa, Biden called the way the AUKUS submarine deal was arranged and announced “clumsy.”
And Biden reportedly said in private that he would go along with one of Macron’s pet “strategic autonomy” projects – an independent and unified European military force that would co-exist alongside France (and Europe’s) solid commitment to NATO.
This partial Franco-American rapprochement comes at a time when liberal democracies are rethinking security strategy and NATO’s role.
On one hand, there is Macron’s idea of strategic autonomy, which now seems to have at least some US backing.
On the other, there is the currently discussed notion of broadening NATO’s mandate to include Asia.
Among other things, extending the alliance’s mandate would institutionalize pressure on Germany to abandon its pro-China foreign policy on the grounds that it was anti-NATO.
In addition, a broader NATO mandate would give Europe a legitimate shot at operating in the Pacific in a more integrated way with the US and its regional allies (Australia, Japan, and South Korea) and collaborators (above all India).
Such integration might even open the prospect of other arms sales, particularly to countries that do not intend to go nuclear or expand their nuclear capacities beyond strategic deterrence.
Germany’s longstanding efforts to mollify China are helping to perpetuate China’s sense of impunity for human-rights abuses.
They are also facilitating German mercantilism and inflicting fractures within the transatlantic alliance.
For all of these reasons, German foreign policy in the post-Merkel era must change course.
For Scholz and his coalition partners, setting a new direction must be a high priority.

Did Hezbollah Win?
In the immediate aftermath of the October War of 1973, the Arab world rejoiced because the myth of Israeli invincibility had been shattered by Egypt’s crossing of the Suez Canal and the Syrian offensive that swept across the Golan Heights.
In Israel, there was harsh criticism of political and military chiefs alike, who were blamed for the loss of 3,000 soldiers in a war that ended without a clear victory.
Prime Minister Golda Meir, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff David Elazar, and the chief of military intelligence were all discredited and soon replaced.
Only afterwards did a sense of proportion take hold, ironically by the Egyptian and Syrian leaders before anyone else.
While commentators in Israel and around the world were still mourning or gloating over Israel’s lost military supremacy, both Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad soberly recognized that their countries had come closer to catastrophic defeat than in 1967, and that it was imperative to avoid another war.
That lead to Sadat’s peace and Assad’s 1974 cease-fire on the Golan Heights, which has never been violated since.
It is easy to read the 1973 war only in retrospect.
Israel had been caught by surprise, because good intelligence was misinterpreted in a climate of arrogant over-confidence.
The frontal sectors, left almost unguarded, were largely overrun.
The Egyptians had an excellent war plan and fought well, and Syrian tanks advanced boldly, attacking in wave after wave for three days and nights.
Within 48 hours, Israel seemed on the verge of defeat on both fronts.
But as soon as the IDF was fully mobilized and the reservist brigades that make up nine-tenths of its strength were ready to deploy for battle, the Israelis stopped both the Egyptian and Syrian armies in their tracks and began their own advance almost immediately.
The war ended with Israeli forces 70 miles from Cairo, and less than 20 miles from Damascus, their success obscured by the shock of the surprise attack, emotional over-reactions, and the difficulty of seeing clearly through the fog of war.
It is the same now with the Lebanon war and the gross misperceptions that have followed.
No one should be surprised the latest anti-tank missiles can penetrate even the heaviest and best protected of battle tanks.
But Israel’s tanks did well enough in limiting Israeli casualties.
Likewise, the lack of defenses against short-range rockets with small warheads is simply common sense. They are just not powerful enough to justify spending billions of dollars for laser weapon systems the size of football fields.
More serious misperceptions are equally obvious.
For example, instead of dismissing Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah’s boasts of victory, many commentators around the world repeat and endorse his claim that Hezbollah fought much more bravely than the regular soldiers of Arab states in previous wars.
But in 1973, after crossing the Suez Canal, Egyptian infantrymen by the thousand stood their ground unflinchingly against advancing Israeli battle tanks.
They were in the open, flat desert, with none of the cover and protection that Hezbollah had in their stone-built villages in Lebanon.
What is true is that the Israelis lacked a coherent war plan, so that even their most purposeful bombing came off as brutally destructive (though with a deterrence payoff, as Syria’s immobility showed).
Similarly, Israel’s ground actions were hesitant and inconclusive from start to finish.
A fully developed contingency plan – a sophisticated blend of amphibious, airborne, and ground penetrations to reach swiftly and deeply behind the front, before rolling back and destroying Hezbollah positions one by one from the rear, all the way to the Israeli border – was never implemented.
The contingency plan remained on the shelf because of the lack of casualties among Israeli civilians.
It had been assumed that thousands of Hezbollah rockets fired in concentrated barrages – which cancel out the inaccuracy of unguided rockets and powerfully compound blast effects – would kill many civilians, perhaps hundreds each day.
That would make a large-scale offensive by more than 45,000 soldiers a compelling necessity, justifying politically the hundreds of casualties it would have cost.
Hezbollah, however, distributed its rockets to village militias that were good at hiding them from air attacks, sheltering them from artillery, and from probing Israeli unmanned air vehicles, but that were incapable of launching them effectively in simultaneous launches against the same targets.
Instead of hundreds of dead civilians, the Israelis were losing one or two a day.
Even after three weeks, the total was less than in some one-man suicide bombings.
That made it politically unacceptable to launch an offensive that would kill young soldiers and family men.
Indeed, nor would such an offensive have eradicated Hezbollah, because it is a political movement in arms, and not just an army or a band of gunmen.
For that very reason, the outcome of the war is likely to be more satisfactory than many now seem to believe.
Unlike Yasser Arafat, who fought for eternal Palestine and not for actual Palestinians, whose prosperity and safety he was always willing to sacrifice for the cause, Nasrallah has a political constituency centered in southern Lebanon.
Having implicitly accepted responsibility for starting the war, Nasrallah has directed Hezbollah to focus on rapid reconstruction in villages and towns, right up to the Israeli border.
Nasrallah’s power base is now a hostage of Hezbollah’s good behavior.
He can hardly afford to start another round of fighting that would destroy everything again.

The Global Consequences of a Sino-American Cold War
NEW YORK – A few years ago, as part of a Western delegation to China, I met President Xi Jinping in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People.
When addressing us, Xi argued that China’s rise would be peaceful, and that other countries – namely, the United States – need not worry about the “Thucydides Trap,” so named for the Greek historian who chronicled how Sparta’s fear of a rising Athens made war between the two inevitable.
In his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?, Harvard University’s Graham Allison examines 16 earlier rivalries between an emerging and an established power, and finds that 12 of them led to war.
No doubt, Xi wanted us to focus on the remaining four.
Despite the mutual awareness of the Thucydides Trap – and the recognition that history is not deterministic – China and the US seem to be falling into it anyway.
Though a hot war between the world’s two major powers still seems far-fetched, a cold war is becoming more likely.
The US blames China for the current tensions.
Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has reaped the benefits of the global trading and investment system, while failing to meet its obligations and free riding on its rules.
According to the US, China has gained an unfair advantage through intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfers, subsidies for domestic firms, and other instruments of state capitalism.
At the same time, its government is becoming increasingly authoritarian, transforming China into an Orwellian surveillance state.
For their part, the Chinese suspect that the US’s real goal is to prevent them from rising any further or projecting legitimate power and influence abroad.
In their view, it is only reasonable that the world’s second-largest economy (by GDP) would seek to expand its presence on the world stage.
And leaders would argue that their regime has improved the material welfare of 1.4 billion Chinese far more than the West’s gridlocked political systems ever could.
Regardless of which side has the stronger argument, the escalation of economic, trade, technological, and geopolitical tensions may have been inevitable.
What started as a trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual animosity.
This is reflected in the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy, which deems China a strategic “competitor” that should be contained on all fronts.
Accordingly, the US is sharply restricting Chinese foreign direct investment in sensitive sectors, and pursuing other actions to ensure Western dominance in strategic industries such as artificial intelligence and 5G.
It is pressuring partners and allies not to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s massive program to build infrastructure projects across the Eurasian landmass.
And it is increasing US Navy patrols in the East and South China Seas, where China has grown more aggressive in asserting its dubious territorial claims.
The global consequences of a Sino-American cold war would be even more severe than those of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union.
Whereas the Soviet Union was a declining power with a failing economic model, China will soon become the world’s largest economy, and will continue to grow from there.
Moreover, the US and the Soviet Union traded very little with each other, whereas China is fully integrated in the global trading and investment system, and deeply intertwined with the US, in particular.
A full-scale cold war thus could trigger a new stage of de-globalization, or at least a division of the global economy into two incompatible economic blocs.
In either scenario, trade in goods, services, capital, labor, technology, and data would be severely restricted, and the digital realm would become a “splinternet,” wherein Western and Chinese nodes would not connect to one another.
Now that the US has imposed sanctions on ZTE and Huawei, China will be scrambling to ensure that its tech giants can source essential inputs domestically, or at least from friendly trade partners that are not dependent on the US.
In this balkanized world, China and the US will both expect all other countries to pick a side, while most governments will try to thread the needle of maintaining good economic ties with both.
After all, many US allies now do more business (in terms of trade and investment) with China than they do with America.
Yet in a future economy where China and the US separately control access to crucial technologies such as AI and 5G, the middle ground will most likely become uninhabitable.
Everyone will have to choose, and the world may well enter a long process of de-globalization.
Whatever happens, the Sino-American relationship will be the key geopolitical issue of this century.
Some degree of rivalry is inevitable.
But, ideally, both sides would manage it constructively, allowing for cooperation on some issues and healthy competition on others.
In effect, China and the US would create a new international order, based on the recognition that the (inevitably) rising new power should be granted a role in shaping global rules and institutions.
If the relationship is mismanaged – with the US trying to derail China’s development and contain its rise, and China aggressively projecting its power in Asia and around the world – a full-scale cold war will ensue, and a hot one (or a series of proxy wars) cannot be ruled out.
In the twenty-first century, the Thucydides Trap would swallow not just the US and China, but the entire world.

Multilateralism’s Crisis Is an Opportunity
NEW YORK – When Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Madagascar last month, it left almost one thousand people dead, and hundreds of thousands more homeless, hungry, and threatened by disease.
According to one estimate, more than $1 billion worth of infrastructure could have been lost.
Such catastrophes have become depressingly familiar.
Idai was the latest in a series of extreme weather events showing us that the devastating effects of climate change lie not in some distant future, but in the present.
Worse, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable communities are being hit the hardest.
Mozambique – the country that suffered the most damage from Idai – will have to rebuild with both hands tied behind its back, because it is currently stuck in negotiations to restructure its unsustainable debt.
To address such challenges, in 2015, the international community adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which laid out a path to shared prosperity and sustainability.
But the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be achieved unless we overhaul our financial systems in accordance with the United Nations’ Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
We need a global financial architecture that will enable us to fund necessary investments (including in resilient infrastructure), respond rapidly to shocks, and put struggling countries on sound financial footing.
There has been some progress.
A new UN assessment of global sustainable-development financing, conducted in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the OECD, finds that private-sector interest in sustainable finance is growing.
Moreover, the SDGs are increasingly being incorporated in public budgets and development cooperation efforts.
But these changes are not happening fast enough nor on anywhere near the scale required.
For example, at $43 billion in the first half of 2018, total private-sector investment in developing-country infrastructure is lower today than it was in the same period in 2012.
To meet the goal of providing universal primary education by 2030, annual education spending in the world’s poorest countries will have to be more than tripled.
At the same time, underlying systemic risks need to be addressed to avert future crises.
Here, the outlook is not promising.
The global economy’s growth has peaked at 3%, which is far short of what is needed to eradicate poverty in many countries.
In 2017, real (inflation-adjusted) wages rose by only 1.8%, the lowest rate in a decade.
Most of the world’s people now live in countries with rising levels of income inequality.
Although globalization has increased wealth substantially and allowed for significant progress in fighting poverty, the gains have not been shared equitably.
Far too many households, communities, and countries have been excluded from rising prosperity.
Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that trust in multilateralism itself has eroded in many parts of the world.
Yet while the multilateral order is suffering a crisis of legitimacy, it is also being afforded an opportunity.
Rapid change – in geopolitics and technology, in addition to the Earth’s climate – have focused our collective attention on challenges to existing arrangements in global finance, trade, debt, tax cooperation, and other areas.
Now that we are revisiting those arrangements, we can repurpose them for sustainable development.
For example, the urgent need for long-term investments to combat climate change has highlighted the short-term orientation of capital markets, and underscored the importance of realigning incentives that drive the behavior of financial system actors.
By the same token, the fact that more than $588 billion of goods were subject to trade restrictions by mid-October 2018 – a sevenfold increase over the previous year – represents a crisis of the multilateral trading system, but also an opportunity to promote a fairer approach to globalization.
Like Mozambique, there are now at least 30 other developing and low-income countries at high risk of debt distress.
But rising sovereign-debt risks, which coincide with a changing creditor landscape, have sensitized the international community to gaps in the existing architecture for sovereign debt sustainability.
Finally, digitalization has fueled the debate about the design of the international tax system and its impact on inequality.
And growing market concentration, particularly in the digital economy, has shone a spotlight on the need to address new technologies’ distributional implications – both within and between countries.
National policies to raise taxes, attract investment, and align domestic financial systems with the SDGs are necessary to usher in the transformation we need.
But the world’s most pressing problems cannot be solved by countries acting on their own.
Rather than retreating from multilateralism, the international community must strengthen collective action.
Only by working together can we achieve great things for the good of all people.
If we fail to do so, we will fail to deliver sustainable development for all.
With the future of the planet and our shared prosperity at stake, there is no excuse for inaction.

Europe’s Refugee Problem, Then and Now
NEW YORK – Earlier this spring, I drove to a beautiful spot on the southern bank of Lake Geneva.
My destination was the Hotel Royale in Évian-les-Bains. It was there, in July 1938, that 32 nations met for a shameful discussion that has been virtually airbrushed from our memory.
Convened by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the massive refugee crisis triggered by Hitler’s virulent anti-Semitism, the Évian conference was a catastrophe.
And its disastrous outcome needs to be recalled in the light of Europe’s current migration crisis.
The Évian conference was supposed to address the plight of hundreds of thousands of German and Austrian Jews who were desperate for refuge.
Roosevelt believed that only a collective solution could meet the challenge.
Hitler, too, hoped that other countries would accept them.
In a speech in Königsberg that March, he jeered, “I can only hope and expect that the other world which has felt such deep sympathy for these criminals will be generous enough to transform this pity into practical aid.
As far as I am concerned we are ready to place our luxury ships at the disposal of these countries for the transportation of these criminals.”
He had already begun to expel Jews, including by placing them forcibly on ships and sending them to various destinations in the Mediterranean and across the Atlantic.
But, throughout Europe, the refugees faced rejection.
On June 6, 1938, as preparations for the conference were underway, the US State Department received a letter concerning 51 Austrian Jewish refugees stranded on a small boat in the international waters of the Danube.
The writer recalled seeing: “the heartrending fate of 51 human beings driven from one frontier to the other.
We have gained personal knowledge of the unspeakable misery that has innocently befallen 100,000 inhabitants of Austria.”
And yet in Évian the following month, although many European delegations voiced eloquent dismay over the torment experienced by the Jews of Germany and Austria, they were unprepared to take concrete action.
The outcome of the meeting was clear: Europe, North America, and Australia would not accept significant numbers of these refugees.
In the verbatim record, two words were uttered repeatedly: “density” and “saturation.”
The European countries were already beset with population “density” and had reached a point of “saturation” – in other words, there was simply no more room at the European inn.
It was an absurd thing to say, of course, in 1938, given the size of Europe’s populations today.
And it would be an equally ridiculous thing to say now, too.
To be sure, the participants in Évian could not have foreseen the Holocaust, or that Europe was being drawn into another devastating war; nonetheless, their lack of moral conscience was breathtaking.
Many of the countries that refused to take in suffering refugees were themselves, in due course, occupied and brutalized by the Nazis – and desperate for the compassion that they denied the Jews in July 1938.
The Nazis must have reveled in the knowledge that their virulent anti-Semitism found an echo – sometimes not so faint – in the rest of Europe.
They also came to realize that if expulsion was not possible, extermination eventually would be.
Today, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, xenophobia, and anti-migrant sentiment are again rising across Europe, and we must stop now and reassess precisely where we are.
A major British tabloid newspaper recently felt it acceptable to allow one of its columnists to call immigrants “cockroaches.”
Rwanda’s Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines used the same word to describe Tutsis in the run-up to the 1994 genocide, as did Julius Streicher’s Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer to describe Jews.
Political leaders across Europe regularly – and shamefully – blame migrants for their national woes.
Attacking migrants or minorities – whether crudely, through language, or more subtly, through policy – is unacceptable everywhere, full stop.
When words are formulated with the clear intention of causing harm and violence on national, racial or religious grounds, freedom of expression becomes incitement to hatred, which is prohibited by law.
Countries that have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes all European Union members, are bound to uphold it.
And yet Europe’s current proposals on migration leave much to be desired.
The continent needs to recall its past more sensitively, and be more generous to the desperate people crossing the Mediterranean.
François Crépeau, the United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, observed in a recent interview that Europe, Australia, and Canada could easily resettle one million Syrian refugees over the next five years, and they could add Eritreans to that list and extend this policy to seven years.
So why is Europe proposing to accept a paltry 20,000-40,000 people annually for resettlement?
To the European politician strongly opposed to migration, I suggest that the next time you need hospital treatment, take a look around you: many of the people caring for you have a migrant’s tale.
And should you quench your thirst with the famous water drawn from Évian-les-Bains, you may wish to reflect on the craven failure of a conference that could have saved so many lives – and on what it can still teach us today.

Emerging Markets Should Go for the Gold
CAMBRIDGE – Are emerging-market central banks overweight in dollars and underweight in gold?
Given a slowing global economy, in which emerging markets are probably very grateful for any reserves they retain, this might seem an ill-timed question.
But there is a good case to be made that a shift in emerging markets toward accumulating gold would help the international financial system function more smoothly and benefit everyone.
Just to be clear, I am not siding with those – usually American far-right crackpots – who favor a return to the gold standard, in which countries fix the value of their currencies in terms of gold.
After all, the gold standard’s last reign ended disastrously in the 1930s, and there is no reason to believe that a return to it would turn out any differently.
No, I am just proposing that emerging markets shift a significant share of the trillions of dollars in foreign-currency reserves that they now hold (China alone has official reserves of $3.3 trillion) into gold.
Even shifting, say, up to 10% of their reserves into gold would not bring them anywhere near the many rich countries that hold 60-70% of their (admittedly smaller) official reserves in gold.
For some time, the rich countries have argued that it is in everyone’s collective interest to demonetize gold.
Sure, we hold a lot of gold, these countries say, but that is a vestige of the pre-World War II gold standard, when central banks needed a stockpile.
Indeed, back in 1999, European central banks, seeing no reason to keep holding so much gold, entered a pact to start reducing their stocks in an orderly fashion.
The sales made sense at the time for most of the participating countries: The real backing for their debt was the tax reach of their governments, their high levels of institutional development, and their relative political stability.
The 1999 pact has been revisited periodically, though since the most recent edition in 2014, most rich countries have taken a long pause, still leaving them with extremely high gold reserves.
Emerging markets have remained buyers of gold, but at a snail’s pace compared to their voracious appetite for US Treasury bonds and other rich-country debt.
As of March 2016, China held just over 2% of its reserves in gold, and the share for India was 5%.
Russia is really the only major emerging market to increase its gold purchases significantly, in no small part due to Western sanctions, with holdings now amounting to almost 15% of reserves.
Emerging markets hold reserves because they do not have the luxury of being able to inflate their way out of a financial crunch or a government debt crisis.
Simply put, they live in a world where a large fraction of international debt – and an even larger share of global trade – is still denominated in hard currency.
So they hold reserves of such currencies as a backstop against fiscal and financial catastrophe.
Yes, in principle, it would be a much better world if emerging markets could somehow pool their resources, perhaps through an International Monetary Fund facility; but the trust required to make such an arrangement work simply is not yet there.
Why would the system work better with a larger share of gold reserves?
The problem with the status quo is that emerging markets as a group are competing for rich-country bonds, which is helping to drive down the interest rates they receive.
With interest rates stuck near zero, rich-country bond prices cannot drop much more than they already have, while the supply of advanced-country debt is limited by tax capacity and risk tolerance.
Gold, despite being in nearly fixed supply, does not have this problem, because there is no limit on its price.
Moreover, there is a case to be made that gold is an extremely low-risk asset with average real returns comparable to very short-term debt.
And, because gold is a highly liquid asset – a key criterion for a reserve asset – central banks can afford to look past its short-term volatility to longer-run average returns.
True, gold does not pay interest, and there are costs associated with storage.
But these costs can be managed relatively efficiently by holding gold offshore if necessary (many countries hold gold at the New York Federal Reserve); and, over time, the price can go up.
It is for this reason that the system as a whole can never run out of monetary gold.
I don’t want to create the impression that by shifting into gold, emerging markets would somehow benefit at the expense of advanced economies.
After all, the status quo is that advanced-economy central banks and treasuries hold vastly more gold than emerging markets do, and a systematic shift by emerging markets will bid up its price.
But this is not a systemic problem; and, in fact, a rise in gold prices would close part of the gap between demand and supply for safe assets that has emerged due to the zero lower bound on interest rates.
There has never been a compelling reason for emerging markets to buy into the rich-country case for completely demonetizing gold.
And there isn’t one now.

A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.
Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "Revisionist" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations.
For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland.
They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither.
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has diminished.
Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day.
If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he admitted that "eventually" a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers.
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.
The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme.
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.

Overcoming the Ideology of Climate Inaction
FORT COLLINS/SARASOTA – Three years ago, the United States achieved a grim milestone: its first climate refugees.
With rising sea levels quickly engulfing the small town of Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribespeople who have long called it home were forced to move.
In the coming years, hundreds of communities across the US will suffer a similar fate, even if greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions cease immediately.
Despite the consensus among scientists about the causes and dire consequences of global warming, policymakers continue to turn a deaf ear to warnings of the impending climate crisis.
Even before US President Donald Trump withdrew America from the 2015 Paris climate accord, the US had not begun to make sharp emissions reductions.
The reason, climate activists increasingly argue, is capitalism, or more precisely the neoliberal ideology that has dominated economic policymaking in the West for at least 40 years.
As debates about a Green New Deal heat up, it is critical for the public to understand the role that neoliberalism has played in derailing policies to curtail emissions, phase out fossil fuels, and adopt renewable-energy technologies.
Climate wonks regularly warn that “business as usual” cannot avert climate change.
But, while that is true, the phrase itself betrays a neoliberal obsession with making “business” fit for purpose – a tweak here, a nudge there – as if citizens were merely passive subjects of larger economic forces.
We all have an active role to play in shaping the economy. But to do so requires that we first shake off the constraints that neoliberal thinking has placed on the public imagination.
Since 1980, the dominant view in Washington, DC, has been that the government should play a minimal role in the economy.
As the anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist famously quipped, “I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.”
The policies that have resulted from this mindset – defunding or otherwise curtailing public investment, deregulating the economy, and decentralizing democracy – have prevented the US from weaning itself off fossil fuels.
Policymakers from both parties have refused to advocate, or even countenance, public investments in carbon-free alternative energy sources and infrastructure.
The belief that government can only ever impede economic dynamism represents a sharp departure from the Keynesian worldview that dominated policymaking from the 1940s to the 1960s.
Policies based on the belief that government spending on public goods complements the private sector, rather than crowding it out, helped the US achieve unprecedented growth in the postwar era.
In a Keynesian economic regime, government interventions are regarded as necessary to solve coordination problems, which is precisely what climate change is.
Sadly, a brief revival of Keynesian thinking after the 2008 financial crisis was quickly stifled by the politics of austerity across the West, foreclosing efforts to reduce GHG emissions through large public investments in transportation, green public housing, and research and development.
The second pillar of neoliberalism, deregulation, has also contributed to climate change.
When seeking to roll back energy-efficiency standards and rules governing fossil-fuel extraction, politicians love to say they are merely “cutting red tape.” But more often than not, these same politicians have been the recipients of the hydrocarbon industry’s largesse.
Unfortunately, as the climate crisis has grown, so, too, has the pressure to deregulate fossil fuels.
For example, in January, a large group of eminent economists published an open letter calling for a modest carbon price (tax) to replace “cumbersome regulations.”
Never mind that those same regulations have yielded significant reductions in GHG emissions in states like California.
Regulations are also largely responsible for the emissions reductions achieved at the federal level, through programs such as renewable portfolio standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.
If the US is to have any chance of reducing emissions in line with what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommends, appropriate environmental regulation must be recognized as a complement to large-scale public investments and carbon pricing, not a substitute.
The third way neoliberalism has undermined climate action is by shifting decisions from the federal to the state and local level.
While local control is useful in some policy arenas, it has exacerbated the tragedy of the commons with respect to climate change.
At the same time that neoliberalism prescribes a carbon price as the solution to climate change, it rejects the centralization needed to make such a policy actually work.
After all, the chances that all US states will implement a carbon price are slim to none. The fossil-fuel industry and its lobbyists have long pitted individual US states – as well as individual labor unions and chapters – against one another by promising to create local jobs in fossil-fuel extraction.
The industry has also campaigned aggressively against green ballot initiatives at the state and local level, where it can easily outspend the competition.
So long as policymakers are bound by the straitjacket of neoliberal ideology, there can be no meaningful progress toward addressing climate change, as US Senator Dianne Feinstein recently made clear to a group of young climate activists in a recorded encounter that was by turns condescending and combative.
Fortunately, the widespread public support for a Green New Deal shows that voters do not share this ideology.
Still, to achieve the Green New Deal’s goal of net carbon neutrality in ten years will require not just an economy-wide carbon price-and-dividend policy, but also large-scale public investment and complementary regulations.
Taken together, these measures could mobilize America’s latent productive capacities in ways not seen since World War II.
Without them, the global effort to tackle climate change will have a snowball’s chance in Hell.

A Breakthrough Against Hunger
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.
With Spain’s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world’s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap.
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.
Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it. With donor help, they can.
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.
By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa.
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.
In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production.
Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.
This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution.
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them.
Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding.
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP).
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.
Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.
The current aid structures are inadequate.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.
African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.
My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.
By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs’ administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help.
The time for business as usual is over.
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.
Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world’s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis.
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.

Saving Freedom of Movement in Europe
MUNICH – According to a YouGov opinion poll conducted on the day of the referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union, migration was the single most important issue for “Leave” supporters, second only to a general preference for independence itself.
But those who consider Brexit voters xenophobic misunderstand the nature of the problem.
Thanks to the Commonwealth, the UK is one of the most open-minded countries in the world.
Accusing the British, of all people, of being xenophobic is absurd.
In reality, the referendum’s outcome reflects legitimate criticism of the EU’s design, which is largely based on open borders toward the outside world and a combination of freedom of movement and the so-called inclusion principle for EU citizens.
The EU should use this British no-confidence vote as an opportunity to change its migration rules fundamentally.
Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron was right to request more concessions in restricting the social inclusion of needy EU citizens.
And, in its own interest, the EU should now implement what Cameron demanded: delayed integration of migrant EU workers into host countries’ welfare systems.
If the EU doesn’t eliminate the current welfare magnet, it will disintegrate, because the migration issue is the most important for citizens in much of the Union.
Political parties that deny this are in for a nasty shock.
The fundamental problem is an intractable trilemma.
It is impossible to meet all of the following EU goals: internal freedom of movement, a welfare state, and inclusion of migrants in host countries’ welfare systems.
Today, a EU citizen who moves to another EU country will be integrated into the social-welfare system very quickly.
Those who are unable to work are fully entitled to tax-financed welfare benefits after five years at the latest.
Earlier access is a matter of national law, and in some cases of jurisdiction.
In Germany, according to a decision by the Federal Social Court of Germany, EU citizens who seek employment but don’t find any are entitled after only half a year to Hartz IV (unemployment and welfare) benefits, free health insurance, and rent payments for housing classified as adequate.
They are also entitled to child benefits for all children, and if they find work, even if the children still live in their home countries in the care of their grandparents.
Those who are self-employed are immediately entitled to supplementary Hartz IV benefits, housing allowance, and the child benefit (which, for a family with five children, is €1,018 ($1,335) per month – more than twice the net salary of an average worker in Bulgaria or Romania.)
If unchanged, the rules of access to national welfare systems will erode the EU’s welfare states, because the most generous countries will increasingly bear the burden of poverty mitigation.
The better-developed welfare states to which the poor flock may then find themselves in a ruinous deterrence competition, with local populations taking to the streets to defend “their” benefits.
This outcome can be prevented only by restricting either freedom of movement or the inclusion principle.
So the EU must acknowledge the tradeoff between the welfare state’s quality, freedom of movement, and inclusion, and it must decide which can be sacrificed.
The best option would be to restrict the inclusion principle for EU migrants, because reducing the size and scope of the welfare state would fuel social instability.
And restricting mobility would mean violating one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms.
Restricting the inclusion principle should not pose a fundamental problem, as all EU countries meet the requirements of the Acquis Communautaire (the body of EU law) and guarantee a minimum of social protection.
Hence, in the case of unearned welfare benefits, tax-financed benefits, and contribution-financed benefits granted during the first years in the new country of residence – the inclusion principle should give way to the home country principle.
In host countries, they will be granted only benefits that have been earned in an insurance system with fair premiums.
Furthermore, the EU needs to close its external borders.
Its labor market, infrastructure, legal system, and welfare benefits represent valuable club goods that cannot be made available for consumption by random economic migrants from all over the world.
Those who believe that a liberal society requires open borders do not understand that the protection of property is a prerequisite for freedom and efficient exchange.
Nevertheless, there is still the humanitarian imperative to grant asylum to the politically persecuted and include them in the welfare system.
But separating those few people (just 0.7% of all processed requests in Germany) who fall into this category from economic migrants requires application systems and reception camps, if necessary, where decisions can be made outside the EU’s borders.
Those who focus only on the angry nationalist rhetoric heard in some corners of the UK’s Leave campaign miss the larger truth.
Unless the EU abandons the inclusion principle, that rhetoric will grow louder – and more exits will become inevitable.

Europe’s Debt Wish
CAMBRIDGE – Eurozone leaders continue to debate how best to reinvigorate economic growth, with French and Italian leaders now arguing that the eurozone’s rigid “fiscal compact” should be loosened.
Meanwhile, the leaders of the eurozone’s northern member countries continue to push for more serious implementation of structural reform.
Ideally, both sides will get their way, but it is difficult to see an endgame that does not involve significant debt restructuring or rescheduling.
The inability of Europe’s politicians to contemplate this scenario is placing a huge burden on the European Central Bank.
Although there are many explanations for the eurozone’s lagging recovery, it is clear that the overhang of both public and private debt looms large.
The gross debts of households and financial institutions are higher today as a share of national income than they were before the financial crisis.
Nonfinancial corporate debt has fallen only slightly.
And government debt, of course, has risen sharply, owing to bank bailouts and a sharp, recession-fueled decline in tax revenues.
Yes, Europe is also wrestling with an aging population.
Southern eurozone countries such as Italy and Spain have suffered from rising competition with China in textiles and light manufacturing industries.
But just as the pre-crisis credit boom masked underlying structural problems, post-crisis credit constraints have greatly amplified the downturn.
True, German growth owes much to the country’s willingness a decade ago to engage in painful economic reforms, especially of labor-market rules.
Today, Germany appears to have full employment and above-trend growth.
German leaders believe, with some justification, that if France and Italy were to adopt similar reforms, the changes would work wonders for their economies’ long-term growth.
Yet what of Portugal, Ireland, and (especially) Spain, all of which have taken significant steps toward reform since the crisis?
All are still experiencing double-digit unemployment rates amid moribund growth, and, as the last International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor made abundantly clear, all still suffer from significant debt problems.
Debt overhang traps countries in a vicious circle.
Exceptionally high public and private debts constrain a country’s options and are indisputably associated with slower growth, which in turn makes it difficult to escape a debt trap.
Last spring’s campaign against anyone who dared to worry about the long-run effects of high debt largely ignored the substantial academic literature, just as a remarkably similar recent challenge to Thomas Piketty’s research on inequality took no account of a larger body of evidence.
It is true that not all debt is created equal, and there is a strong case for adding more of it if the purpose is to finance highly productive infrastructure investments.
Europe greatly lags many Asian countries in its efforts to expand the reach of broadband.
Outside the Nordic countries, electricity networks are thoroughly Balkanized, and major efforts are needed to integrate them.
Raising debt for the purposes of significantly increasing or ensuring long-run growth makes sense, especially in an environment of low real interest rates.
A similar argument can be made for expenditures aimed at improving education, for example to improve Europe’s underfunded universities.
Beyond growth-enhancing investment, however, the case for greater stimulus becomes more nuanced.
Brad Delong and Larry Summers have argued that in a repressed economy, short-term increases in borrowing can pay for themselves, even if the expenditures do not directly increase long-run potential.
By contrast, Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna argue that in an economy with a large and inefficient government, debt-stabilization measures directed at reducing the size of government can actually be expansionary.
I admit to being an outsider to this debate.
(The word “austerity” does not appear once in my 2009 book with Carmen Reinhart on the history of financial crises.)
My general sense, however, is that both views are extreme.
In general, neither pure austerity nor crude Keynesian stimulus can help countries escape high-debt traps.
Throughout history, other measures, including debt rescheduling, inflation, and various forms of wealth taxation (such as financial repression), have typically played a significant role.
It is hard to see how European countries can indefinitely avoid recourse to the full debt toolkit, especially to repair the fragile economies of the eurozone’s periphery.
The ECB’s expansive “whatever it takes” guarantee may indeed be enough to help finance greater short-term stimulus than is currently being allowed; but the ECB’s guarantee will not solve long-run sustainability problems.
Indeed, the ECB will soon have to confront the fact that structural reforms and fiscal austerity fall far short of being a complete solution to Europe’s debt problems.
In October and November, the ECB will announce the results of its bank stress tests.
Because many banks hold a large volume of eurozone government debt, the results will depend very much on how the ECB assesses sovereign risk.
If the ECB grossly understates the risks, its credibility as a regulator will be badly tarnished.
If it is more forthright about the risks, there is a chance that some periphery countries might have difficulty plugging the holes, and will require help from the north.
One hopes that the ECB will be forthright.
It is high time for a conversation on debt relief for the entire eurozone periphery.

Mexico’s Second Revolution
MEXICO CITY – Mexico, a stagnant and violence-plagued country in recent years, finally began to overcome its malaise in 2013, thanks to an activist president and a coalition of political parties determined to move the country forward.
But, alongside substantive changes, there is considerable uncertainty and hyperbole.
It could hardly be otherwise.
The situation resembles that of 20 years ago – almost to the day.
When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, Canada, and the United States entered into force on January 1, 1994, it seemed that Mexico was poised for a true takeoff.
But a series of events – the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, the assassinations of a presidential candidate and the incoming president’s chief aide, and the collapse of the currency – shook Mexico that year, underscoring the depth of the challenges it faced.
NAFTA brought with it a spectacular increase in Mexican exports, as well as a dramatic shift in their composition.
But it proved to be a great disappointment in terms of foreign investment inflows and economic growth, which has averaged 2.6% per year over the last two decades – slower than Peru, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, and Uruguay.
As a result, Mexico’s income gap with the US and Canada has barely narrowed.
Thus, President Enrique Peña Nieto’s task since taking office one year ago has been to ensure that the promise of major change in Mexico finally translates into sustained economic growth, improved living standards, and faster convergence with the US and Canada.
While both the foreign and local press refer generally to “reforms,” or lump together education, labor, financial, fiscal, energy, telecommunications, and political reforms, there are significant differences among them.
Some consider all of the changes that have taken place in Mexico this year to be equally important.
Others have mused that Peña Nieto’s administration sometimes seems intent on announcing reforms, regardless of their content, the time necessary to implement them, or their actual impact on Mexican society.
In fact, a clear distinction can be drawn between two subsets of legislative achievements: those that, while not meaningless, are incomplete, superficial, or essentially maintain the status quo, and those that will change Mexico (if all goes well).
The changes in how teachers are evaluated and their labor rights (wrongly described as an education reform), together with changes to tax and telecommunications legislation, belong to the first category; energy and political reforms belong to the second.
Energy reform opens up electricity generation and oil exploration, extraction, and refining to private foreign or domestic investment through licenses, concessions, production sharing, or profit sharing.
The oil workers’ union has been banished from the board of directors of Pemex, the national oil company, and new contracts for shale oil and gas, together with deep-water prospecting and drilling, will be signed with a government agency, not with Pemex.
Once the myriad legal and political obstacles are cleared, Mexico will be able to increase oil and gas production, drive down the price of electricity, and stimulate growth in an otherwise lethargic economy.
One hopes that 12 years of obstruction by Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) will not mean that these reforms are too little, too late.
The second crucial reform is political.
For the first time since the early 1920’s, Mexican legislators and mayors will be allowed to seek reelection to consecutive terms.
While no panacea, reelection is one of the most important instruments of accountability in a democracy, and Mexico has been deprived of it for nearly a century.
The same is true of ballot initiatives, referenda, and independent candidacies, all of which were non-existent until the recent reform.
For the first time since Mexico left behind 70 years of authoritarian rule, the country has a political and electoral framework that resembles those found in all modern democracies.
Both reforms are incomplete and may not be sufficient to jump-start the economy and mobilize a singularly passive civil society.
Because Pemex, unlike the Brazilian and Colombian state-owned oil companies, will not be listed on the New York or Mexico City stock exchanges, internal reform will be postponed or half-baked.
Moreover, it will be years before any oil actually begins to flow from the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and how much shale oil and gas actually exists in northeastern Mexico is unknown.
Nor is it certain that foreign investment (or tourism) will increase, given the country’s current levels of violence, crime, and human-rights violations.
Likewise, restrictions and ambiguities continue to plague the institutional arrangements sought by the framers of the country’s political and electoral reforms.
Reelection is permitted only for candidates nominated by the same party for which they originally ran, and the enabling legislation for independent candidates, ballot initiatives, and referenda remains unclear.
Most important, the government appears to be backtracking on a commitment to allow a binding referendum on the opening of the oil sector and other “transcendent” issues.
Its reluctance is understandable, because voters are evenly divided on the issue, and no one will invest a cent in Mexican oil or gas if the recently approved constitutional amendment on Pemex can be overturned in 2015, as the opposition claims will happen.
But curtailing democracy in order to modernize the energy sector is not a good idea.
Finally, skepticism persists with regard to the Mexican economy’s capacity to achieve sustainable 4-5% annual economic growth – the bare minimum needed to ensure long-term prosperity.
Deficient education, infrastructure, security, and courts, together with endemic corruption and scant entrepreneurial dynamism, militate against excessive optimism.
NAFTA 20 years ago, and Peña Nieto’s reforms now, are necessary but insufficient conditions for progress.
More is needed, and what is needed is not necessarily attainable.

Islam’s Forsaken Renaissance
Children often play a game where they sit in a circle.
One whispers something to his neighbor, who then whispers that information to the next child, and so on, around the circle.
By the time the last child whispers the information to the first, it is totally different from what was originally said.
Something like that seems to have happened within Islam.
The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, brought one – and only one – religion.
Yet today we have perhaps a thousand religions that all claim to be Islam.
Divided by their different interpretations, Muslims do not play the role they once did in the world; instead, they are weakened and victimized.
The Shia/Sunni schism is so deep that each side condemns followers of the other as apostates, kafir.
The belief that the other’s religion is not Islam, and its followers not Muslim, has underpinned internecine wars in which millions have died – and continue to die.
Even among the Sunnis and Shias there are further divisions.
The Sunnis have four imams and the Shias have twelve; their teachings all differ.
Then there are other divisions, including the Druze, the Alawites, and the Wahabis.
We are also taught by our ulamas (religious instructors) that their teachings must not be questioned.
Islam is a faith. It must be believed.
Logic and reason play no part in it.
But what is it that we must believe when each branch of Islam thinks the other one is wrong?
The Koran, after all, is one book, not two or three, or a thousand.
According to the Koran, a Muslim is anyone who bears witness that “there is no God (Allah) but Allah, and that Muhammad is his Rasul (Messenger).”
If no other qualification is added, then all those who subscribe to these precepts must be regarded as Muslims.
But because we Muslims like to add qualifications that often derive from sources other than the Koran, our religion’s unity has been broken.
But perhaps the greatest problem is the progressive isolation of Islamic scholarship – and much of Islamic life – from the rest of the modern world.
We live in an age of science in which people can see around corners, hear and see things happening in outer space, and clone animals.
And all of these things seem to contradict our belief in the Koran.
This is so because those who interpret the Koran are learned only in religion, in its laws and practices, and thus are usually unable to understand today’s scientific miracles.
The fatwas (legal opinions concerning Islamic law) that they issue appear unreasonable and cannot be accepted by those with scientific knowledge.
One learned religious teacher, for example, refused to believe that a man had landed on the moon.
Others assert that the world was created 2,000 years ago.
The age of the universe and its size measured in light years – these are things that the purely religiously trained ulamas cannot comprehend.
This failure is largely responsible for the sad plight of so many Muslims.
Today’s oppression, the killings and the humiliations of Muslims, occurs because we are weak, unlike the Muslims of the past.
We can feel victimized and criticize the oppressors, but to stop them we need to look at ourselves.
We must change for our own good.
We cannot ask our detractors to change, so that Muslims benefit.
So what do we need to do?
In the past, Muslims were strong because they were learned.
Muhammad’s injunction was to read, but the Koran does not say what to read.
Indeed, there was no “Muslim scholarship” at the time, so to read meant to read whatever was available.
The early Muslims read the works of the great Greek scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers.
They also studied the works of the Persians, the Indians, and the Chinese.
The result was a flowering of science and mathematics.
Muslim scholars added to the body of knowledge and developed new disciplines, such as astronomy, geography, and new branches of mathematics.
They introduced numerals, enabling simple and limitless calculations.
But around the fifteenth century, the learned in Islam began to curb scientific study.
They began to study religion alone, insisting that only those who study religion – particularly Islamic jurisprudence – gain merit in the afterlife.
The result was intellectual regression at the very moment that Europe began embracing scientific and mathematical knowledge.
And so, as Muslims were intellectually regressing, Europeans began their renaissance, developing improved ways of meeting their needs, including the manufacture of weapons that eventually allowed them to dominate the world.
By contrast, Muslims fatally weakened their ability to defend themselves by neglecting, even rejecting, the study of allegedly secular science and mathematics, and this myopia remains a fundamental source of the oppression suffered by Muslims today.
Many Muslims still condemn the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kamal, because he tried to modernize his country.
But would Turkey be Muslim today without Ataturk?
Mustafa Kamal’s clear-sightedness saved Islam in Turkey and saved Turkey for Islam.
Failure to understand and interpret the true and fundamental message of the Koran has brought only misfortune to Muslims.
By limiting our reading to religious works and neglecting modern science, we destroyed Islamic civilization and lost our way in the world.
The Koran says that “Allah will not change our unfortunate situation unless we make the effort to change it.”
Many Muslims continue to ignore this and, instead, merely pray to Allah to save us, to bring back our lost glory.
But the Koran is not a talisman to be hung around the neck for protection against evil.
Allah helps those who improve their minds.

The Silent Arab Majority Must Speak Up
ALGIERS – Since the United Nations Development Program began work on the Arab Human Development Reports (AHDR) in 2001, the situation in many Arab countries has gone from bad to worse.
In fact, today the region cannot even come together to publish a new report.
This is unfortunate, because finding a new shared vision for Arab people, especially Arab youth, is a prerequisite for ever achieving peace and prosperity in the Middle East and North Africa.
The first AHDR, published in 2002, identified three major “development deficits” holding the region back: knowledge, women’s empowerment, and freedom.
The report, described as “written by Arabs for Arabs,” had a clear influence on the regional development narrative and the way national elites talked about the problems facing their societies.
Around the time of the first AHDR, the Arab world had reasons for optimism.
Israel, having withdrawn from Lebanon in 2000, withdrew from Gaza in 2005.
New Arab leaders – such as Abdullah II in Jordan, Mohammed VI in Morocco, and Bashar al-Assad in Syria – were coming to power and generating hope for change.
Saudi Arabia announced its first municipal elections in 2003, and held them in 2005.
Egypt and Iraq also both held (mostly) democratic elections in 2005.
And Algeria’s attempt to quell longstanding civil strife was largely successful, thanks in part to high oil prices throughout this period.
After the Arab Spring, which began in December 2010 and gained momentum through 2011, the UNDP began the 2015 AHDR, which focused specifically on the plight of Arab youth.
I was a member of the 2015 AHDR team, along with around 30 intellectuals and activists from the Arab world.
The 2015 AHDR shared similar themes with its 2002 precursor, but this time we engaged more directly with influential Arab youth to compile the best data possible, and to put a spotlight on the effects of the wars engulfing the region.
The 2015 report was finalized in May 2015.
But it has lain in the drawers of the UNDP Arab Bureau in New York ever since, probably in no small part due to its harsh judgment of the Arab power elite.
One finding from the 2015 report that I can speak to directly is the emergence in the Arab world of a “silent majority” with a more liberal mindset, especially among the young.
This promising trend reveals itself in generational comparisons of global opinion polls.
Arab youth have more access to information from the outside world than ever before, and they are embracing values shared by other young people globally, rather than the values of their parents’ generation.
Specifically, Arab youth yearn for greater participation in civil society, emancipation from patriarchal hierarchies, and more space for individual creativity.
While education did not emancipate as much as in the rest of the world, owing to the conservative curriculum, youth did.
Given these findings, the 2015 report advises national, regional, and international progressive groups to support the forces of emancipation, which hold the key to finding homegrown solutions to the challenges of ensuring better governance, more productive economies, and more resilient societies.
The only route to large-scale change in the Arab world is to unleash innovation and creativity – and that demands an unbounded civil society.
Fundamental civil rights must be established, supported by deep changes in the education system, reforms of family law, and a more open space for media and culture.
The 2015 report, which I hope will be published soon, should encourage a reasoned and constructive regional conversation.
It begins with this warning: “The youth of the region are becoming continually more disenchanted with the ossified political power structures that marginalize them. Unless governments wake up to this blinding reality, they are going to have to deal with far more than a few extremists.”
The new silent majority is the best defense against the radical and suicidal undercurrents that have filled the political vacuum created by the collapse of the old order.
Reform-minded Arabs must aim to widen the center, rather than trying to bring together the fringes.
And the silent majority needs to break its silence.
Otherwise, revolts against an unacceptable status quo will continue to be led by extremists, who have only grievances, not aspirations.
The early 2000s held promise for the Arab world, and in today’s youth we can see it renewed.
Arab civil-society reformers must be encouraged to speak up now, or risk losing that promise for another generation.

Fixing Europe's Stability Pact
Europe's Stability Pact - which underpins the euro by setting fixed constraints on the size of budget deficits for euro members - is in trouble.
The European Union's leading country, Germany, failed to meet its commitments to its EU partners concerning its deficit.
Furthermore, it used its political muscle to block the early warning about its deficit that the EU Commission had mandated by the terms of the Stability Pact.
Now France is making waves.
The EU's reluctant number two country has served unofficial notice that it, too, does not plan to abide by its deficit-reduction promises. This comes one year after tiny Ireland received an official warning about its fiscal policies, even though Ireland's budget was in surplus, and mightily so.
So, four years after it was signed, the Stability Pact seems to be in shambles.
Indeed, Europe is now rife with talk about junking it, as well as with discussions about how to fix it.
Rightly so: the Pact is ill-conceived and its implementation ill-designed.
Not only is the Pact's fixed 3% limit for the ratio of budget deficit to GDP arbitrary, but it also ignores the fact that when an economy slows, deficits increase automatically.
Recognizing this fact, the Pact's architects made things worse by adopting two misguided `solutions'.
They introduced a safety clause allowing a country to suspend the deficit ceiling in case of serious recession, but they went on to define a serious recession in such a way as to make such a suspension implausible in practice.
Mindful that normal slowdowns could lead to a breach of the ceiling, they decreed that a normal deficit is a zero deficit.
Accordingly, each year, every county is required to submit a budget that projects two years ahead which demonstrates how its budget will be balanced in that time.
Germany's commitment for 2002 was made in early 2001 when its economy was growing at a reasonable pace.
The unanticipated slowdown made it impossible for Germany to meet the target.
Finance Minister Hans Eichel decided, reasonably, not to worsen conditions by adopting a contractionary fiscal policy.
The Commission, seeking to project itself as the protector of the Pact, sought to issue a warning. But that decision had to be taken by real-life politicians, the Council of Finance Ministers.
No one on the Council wanted to upset Germany, for all of them recognized that the same problem could one day confront them.
No warning was issued.
France's case is different.
During elections, politicians invariably make promises, including those of tax cuts.
In a country with crushing rates of taxation, this is not only smart politics, but it is also good economics, provided spending is cut.
But France is also a country where everyone enjoys some publicly-funded privilege, so cuts are a political "no-no."
Thus France cannot meet the Pact's deficit target.
The Commission expresses outrage, but France is skilled at challenging the EU's rules of common behavior.
Political scheming is guaranteed.
Economists and cynics are not surprised.
The Pact's objective - to enforce fiscal discipline in countries that share the same currency - is worthy.
But having lost control of their national monetary policies, euro member countries retain only one macroeconomic instrument, fiscal policy.
The challenge, therefore, is to combine long-run discipline with short-run flexibility.
Like promising to go on a diet just before a big party, this challenge is not easily met.
The Stability Pact is too crude and technocratic: a 3% deficit target enforced by Brussels bureaucrats cannot bind real-life politicians.
A solution must be found elsewhere.
Fortunately, we need not look far.
Monetary policy faces a similar challenge.
It needs to deliver price stability in the long run while being flexible enough in the short run to deal with business cycles.
Over the last decade, monetary policy has been a true success story.
Everywhere the recipe is roughly the same: delegate policy to a group of competent people - the central bank - by making them formally independent from political pressure and providing them with a clear, explicit mandate.
Knowing that any slippage today will need to be dealt with tomorrow, they exercise their best judgment.
This has been a spectacular improvement over the monetary rules of the past.
The same approach should work for fiscal policy.
Some, of course, may fear a loss of democratic accountability.
It is essential to realize that fiscal policy fulfills two very different tasks.
The first task is structural and redistributive: it concerns the size of the budget and its detailed structure on both the spending and revenue sides.
Decisions on such issues cannot be delegated; they must remain in the hands of elected governments and be subject to parliamentary approval and oversight.
The second task is macroeconomic: it is about setting the budget balance to deal with cyclical fluctuations.
That task does not differ from monetary policy and can be delegated to an independent body.
So what Europe must to do is clear.
Each country should regain full control of its fiscal policy but delegate its macroeconomic component, decisions about deficits or surpluses, to an independent Fiscal Policy Committee given the long-run mandate of stabilizing, or in some countries reducing, the size of the public debt.
In order to guarantee the outcome, the statutes of such committees and their mandates ought to be agreed upon by all euro members. No more Brussels interference, no more arbitrary rules, no more political judgments-- just plain common sense.

Egypt after Morsi
BERLIN – Egypt lies at the heart of the Arab revolution, even if the original spark occurred in Tunisia.
But Egypt – with its strategic location, stable borders, large population, and ancient history – has been the principal power of the Arab world for centuries, defining the movement of history there like no other.
This implies that the overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, will have much broader repercussions.
Was Morsi’s ouster a classic counterrevolution in the guise of a military coup?
Or did the coup prevent a total takeover of power by the Muslim Brotherhood, and thus avert Egypt’s economic collapse and chaotic descent into religious dictatorship?
No one should deny that what happened in Egypt was a military coup, or that forces from former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime have returned to power.
But, unlike in 2011, when the few pro-Western liberals and huge numbers of urban, middle-class youth rallied against Mubarak, now the same groups support the coup, lending it a certain (democratic?) legitimacy.
Nonetheless, the overthrow of a democratically elected government by the military cannot be glossed over.
So what options does Egypt now have?
Will it repeat the Algerian tragedy, in which the military canceled an election to prevent Islamists from assuming power, leading to an eight-year civil war that claimed up to 200,000 lives?
Will the country return to military dictatorship?
Or will Egypt end up with something like a Kemalist “democracy” of the type that long prevailed in Turkey, with a civilian government but the military pulling the strings?
All three alternatives are possible, though it is impossible to predict which one will come to pass.
But one thing already can be said for certain: the basic distribution of power within Egyptian society has not changed.
The military and the Muslim Brotherhood divide power between themselves. The Western-oriented liberals do not have any real power and stand, as we are seeing now, on the army’s shoulders.
We should not forget that Morsi’s opponent in the presidential election in 2012 was Ahmed Shafik, a former general and the last Mubarak-era prime minister – certainly no liberal.
A victory by either the Brotherhood or the military would not be a victory for democracy.
Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2006, may serve as an example of what the Brotherhood wants: undivided power, including over the military.
Likewise, the Egyptian army’s hold on power, beginning in the 1950’s, resulted in a decades-long military dictatorship.
But there is a third and new factor now in play, one that does not measure power in the same way as the military and the Brotherhood.
Through their leadership of the protests for two years, urban middle-class youth have gained their own legitimacy, and, with their technological and linguistic capacities, are able to dominate global debate about Egypt.
These young people want progress, not power; they want the future to resemble the life that they see on the Internet and in the West.
If this movement were channeled into institutional politics, it would significantly affect Egypt’s internal distribution of power.
Egypt’s unfolding drama will be framed by the triangle of contradictions and demands among these three groups.
And it should not be forgotten that, along with young people’s sense that they lacked a future under the nationalistic military dictatorships of the past, mass poverty was the second trigger of the 2011 revolution.
Underlying the contradiction between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood is not only the question of religion, but also all of the social problems, including inequality, that riddle Arab societies.
The Brotherhood has effectively assumed a role similar to that of left-wing European political parties in the nineteenth century.
Whoever wants to weaken the Brotherhood has to address the urgent social issues that it raises and try to solve them.
This means that whatever solution ultimately prevails will be measured according to whether it can solve the economic crisis (particularly the lack of job opportunities for the young) and deepening mass poverty.
The chances of this are slim.
Throughout the Arab world, nationalism constricts societies and retards cooperation, the dismantling of tariffs, and the creation of an economic community.
And yet the economies of the Arab countries in crisis are too small to succeed on their own; even if everything goes well, they cannot offer their large and young populations hope of a positive future.
They need enhanced cooperation, which, given a common language, would rest on a stronger foundation than it does in Europe.
In Egypt, the West should work with all three leading political forces – the military, the Brotherhood, and the urban young – because no short-term solution will come in the form of one option.
The worst approach would be to marginalize or even persecute the Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam again.
More broadly, with Syria’s civil war destabilizing Lebanon and threatening to do the same in Jordan, and with Iraq plagued by similar sectarian violence, the military coup in Egypt appears to herald the end of the Arab revolutions, at least for the time being.
Everywhere, the signs are pointing backwards.
But we should not be deceived.
Even if the struggle for power seems decided, this does not mean a return to the former status quo.
When the revolutions of 1848 in Europe were rolled back the following year, everything was nonetheless different, as we now know.
The monarchies remained in power for decades, but the Industrial Revolution and the advent of democracy had become unstoppable.
We also know, however, that this led Europe to a future that was anything but serene.
The Arab world might not be so deeply affected, but the near future there will certainly be neither peaceful nor stable.

Politics, Economics, and Carbon in 2019
STANFORD – For many of the world’s economies, financial markets, heads of government, and carbon policies, 2018 did not end well.
The scars of the global financial crisis and Great Recession, combined with longer-term structural economic, technological, cultural, and demographic trends, have left large swaths of the population in many countries feeling politically neglected, culturally disparaged, and/or economically wounded.
And their expression oftheir grievances – at the polls, on the Internet, and in the streets – has left their leaders profoundly weakened.
In Germany, four-term Chancellor Angela Merkel has long acted as the European Union’s de facto leader. Then came her fateful 2015 decision to welcome more than one million refugees into Germany.
The backlash – fueled by frustration with the added pressure on public services, finances, and law enforcement, not to mention political fearmongering – left Merkel so wounded that she did not seek reelection as leader of her party this month, and will not stand for reelection as chancellor after her current term expires in 2021.
Anti-immigrant sentiment is hardly confined to Germany.
From Italy to Poland, it has helped populist political parties win power.
Hungary erected barbed-wire fences to keep out refugees.
Denmark confiscated immigrants’ assets and is now set to send hundreds of “unwanted” asylum-seekers to a remote, uninhabited island once used for research on diseased animals.
Resistance to immigration and, more broadly, anxiety about the surrender of sovereignty to the EU also helped to propel another key development of recent years: the United Kingdom’s 2016 Brexit referendum.
After then-Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold a popular vote to leave the EU – a ploy to maximize his 2015 reelection victory margin – he was unable to gain enough flexibility from the bloc’s leaders, including greater control over immigration, to convince a majority of voters to remain.
In 2018, the Brexit drama continued.
Prime Minster Theresa May secured a compromise deal with the EU, but, facing a resounding defeat in Parliament, was forced to postpone a vote on it until January.
Opposition to her compromises was so strong among her fellow Tories that she was forced to endure a Conservative Party no-confidence vote.
While May managed to survive that challenge, she remains trapped between the rock of the EU’s refusal to offer any more concessions and the hard place of deep domestic divisions.
Polls now indicate that the Labour Party’s hard-left and apparently anti-Semitic leader Jeremy Corbyn is likely to be Britain’s next prime minister.
Then there is France, where President Emmanuel Macron – once hailed as Europe’s next de facto leader – has faced a wave of protests and civil disorder in recent weeks.
Macron had already been struggling to enact his pro-growth reform agenda, focused on imposing modest constraints on France’s hypertrophied welfare state.
But it was a fuel-tax increase, billed as a measure to help reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, that triggered the so-called Yellow Vest protests.
In the world’s most highly taxed major economy, citizens have apparently had enough of the political class tending to what they perceive as a distant global goal, rather than to voters’ immediate needs.
Similarly, in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a backlash against a federal carbon tax imposed on the four (of ten) Canadian provinces that rejected his original emissions-reduction policies – and it might cost him his job next year.
The heightened tension between central and subnational governments is one of the most important, yet least reported global trends of recent years.
Climate action is facing headwinds elsewhere, too.
At this month’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24), held in the Polish coal-mining city of Katowice, negotiators barely managed to agree on a rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement, including a consistent methodology for measuring progress.
More tellingly, it was revealed at COP24 that many other countries are lagging behind their Paris commitments (which, even if met, probably won’t be enough to achieve global emissions goals).
That includes Germany, where Merkel’s renewables push and nuclear phase-out have resulted in increased reliance on the dirtiest form of coal, lignite, to keep prices manageable and provide a backup for wind and solar.
Early in the conference, criticism centered on the United States, because of President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement as soon as possible (in 2020).
But America’s emissions reduction record remains among the world’s best, despite growing resistance to new climate policies.
For example, the states of Washington, Arizona, and Colorado recently rejected initiatives to curb fossil-fuel use.
Even in ultra-green California, a previously enacted fuel-tax hike was almost repealed; it survived only because voters were concerned about how to fund repairs to the state’s maintenance-starved roads and highways.
Climate is far from the only concern dogging the Trump administration.
In this year’s midterm elections, his Republican Party lost control of the US House of Representatives.
While macroeconomic indicators remain strong, many are worried about rising interest rates, slowing growth abroad, and late-cycle economic and market tendencies.
Trump’s tariffs, especially against China, are amplifying these concerns, as they risk offsetting the growth-enhancing effects of his tax and regulatory reforms.
Beyond the West, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party justsuffered heavy losses in five state elections, owing to mounting economic worries.
Economic concerns are intensifying in China, too, as growth slows, trade disputes with the US escalate, and global complaints about cyber espionage, forced technology transfer, and its ambitious “Made in China 2025” industrial policy lead to bans on some Chinese tech companies’ products.
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s grip on power, however, remains tight.
The political recalibrations occurring in the world’s major economies highlight the limits on the level and pace of immigration a society can absorb without excessive disruption; on citizens’ willingness to abide centralized, let alone supranational, rule; and on public tolerance of economic weakness.
As 2019 begins, leaders must focus on bread-and-butter domestic issues, while moving toward more flexible and decentralized political models capable of governing diverse populations.
This will not only improve stability within countries; it will also provide stronger foundations for cooperation on high-priority international issues, from trade to climate risk.

The Emperor’s New Goal
NEW DELHI – Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, in a rare overseas trip, are scheduled to begin a tour of the Indian cities of New Delhi and Chennai on November 30.
The imperial couple’s weeklong visit is likely to mark a defining moment in Indo-Japanese relations, fostering closer economic and security ties between Asia’s two leading democracies as they seek a pluralistic, stable Asian order.
Traditionally, a visit from the Japanese emperor – except for a coronation or royal anniversary celebration – signified a turning point in a bilateral relationship.
While the emperor is merely the “symbol of the state” under Japan’s US-imposed postwar constitution, he retains significant influence, owing to Japanese veneration of the imperial dynasty – the world’s oldest continuous hereditary monarchy, the origins of which can be traced to 660 BC.
Indeed, the emperor’s overseas visits remain deeply political, setting the tone – if not the agenda – for Japan’s foreign policy.
Consider Akihito’s 1992 visit to China – the first such visit by any Japanese emperor. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s government – grateful for Japan’s reluctance to maintain punitive sanctions over the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and eager for international recognition, not to mention Japanese capital and commercial technologies – had extended seven invitations over two years.
Akihito’s trip, which came at the height of Japan’s pro-China foreign policy, was followed by increased Japanese aid, investment, and technology transfer, thereby cementing Japan’s role in China’s economic rise.
The improved diplomatic relationship lasted until the recent flare-up of territorial and other bilateral disputes.
Although no Japanese emperor has visited India before, the bilateral relationship runs deep.
In traditional Japanese culture, India is Tenjiku (the country of heaven).
Today, Japan is India’s largest source of aid and has secured a key role in supporting infrastructure development, financing projects like the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and the Bangalore Metro Rail Project.
With these natural allies seeking to add strategic bulk to their rapidly multiplying ties, Akihito’s tour is the most significant visit to India by any foreign leader in recent years.
Indeed, it is expected to be one of the last foreign trips for the 79-year-old emperor, who has undergone several major surgeries in the past decade.
Akihito’s travel schedule contrasts sharply with that of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Despite having had open-heart surgery during his first term, India’s 81-year-old leader has sought to offset his low domestic political stock by flying more than one million kilometers on overseas trips – including visits to Japan, China, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, and the United States in the last six months alone.
The paradox of Akihito’s tour – for which Singh has appointed a special envoy with ministerial rank to oversee preparations – is that Japan is investing substantial political capital to build a strong, long-term partnership with India’s government at a time when India is gripped by policy paralysis.
Japan’s leaders are perhaps counting on the continuity of India’s strategic policies, which would require the Indian government that emerges from next year’s general election to sustain the momentum of cooperation.
But, more important, Japan is adjusting to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing regional environment, characterized by rising geopolitical competition with China.
In a historical reversal, Japan has found itself on the defensive against the increasingly muscular foreign policy of its former colony and old rival.
This situation is forcing the Japanese government to reconsider its postwar pacifism, revise its defense strategy, and increase its military spending.
In this context, Japan knows that a deeper strategic collaboration with India – which is also seeking to blunt increasing military pressure from China – is its best move.
In modern history, Japan has had the distinction of consistently staying ahead of the rest of Asia.
During the Meiji era, in the second half of the nineteenth century, it became the first Asian country to modernize.
It was also the first Asian country to emerge as a world power, defeating Manchu-ruled China and Czarist Russia in separate wars.
And after its defeat in World War II, Japan rose from the ashes to become Asia’s first global economic powerhouse.
With per capita GDP of more than $37,000, Japan still ranks among the world’s richest countries, specializing in the highest-value links of global supply chains.
And income inequality in Japan ranks among the lowest in Asia.
Nonetheless, almost two decades of economic stagnation have eroded Japan’s regional clout.
This raises the question of whether Japan’s current problems –sluggish growth, high public debt, and rapid population aging – presage a similar trend across East Asia.
Similar problems are already appearing in South Korea, while China has been driven to loosen its one-child policy and unveil plans for economic reforms aimed at reviving growth.
For India, Japan is indispensable as both an economic and a security partner.
It is central to India’s “Look East” policy, which has evolved into more of an “Act East” policy, whereby the original strategy’s economic logic has been amplified by the larger geopolitical objective of ensuring Asian stability and a regional balance of power.
It is in this light that Akihito’s historic visit should be viewed.

A Step Closer to Brexit?
LONDON – The referendum on Scottish independence, due on September 18, comes at a time of growing opposition in the United Kingdom to remaining in the European Union.
This is significant, because Scotland is the strongest base of pro-European sentiment in the UK.
For example, a poll conducted earlier this year determined that if a referendum on continued EU membership had been held in June in the UK as a whole, 47.1% would have voted to leave, with 39.4% voting to remain.
But a poll in February 2014 showed that in Scotland, 48.7% would vote for the UK to remain in the EU, with 35.4% voting to leave.
Other polls have also shown a consistent and markedly more positive attitude toward the EU in Scotland than in England.
Of course, it is premature to draw any firm conclusions from these figures.
The referendum on exiting the EU that Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed may not take place, regardless of the success (whatever that may mean) of his promised “renegotiation” of the terms of British membership.
But, as a result of various ostensibly minor issues, the likelihood of a British exit seems to be increasing – which fundamentally alters the importance of the vote in Scotland.
For example, the proposal of the relatively unknown Jonathan Hill, the leader of the UK House of Lords, as the British member of the new European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker was just the latest in a long series of British EU errors.
Cameron’s spokesmen said in July that, at his first meeting with the new Commission president, Cameron would seek a prestigious portfolio, such as the internal market, for Hill.
Juncker’s office coldly replied that important portfolios in the new Commission would go to major political figures, and that Juncker “does not owe [Cameron] anything.”
Given Cameron’s opposition to Juncker’s candidacy for the Commission presidency, the abuse to which Juncker has been subjected by the British press, and Hill’s lack of centrality within British politics, Cameron may be justifiably nervous when Juncker announces his appointments to the new Commission.
Juncker, after all, has many senior politicians to accommodate, and their approval by the European Parliament is no minor matter.
And, though it was perhaps unsurprising that Cameron should be unenthusiastic about Juncker’s candidacy, the vehemence of his opposition was extraordinary.
Cameron no doubt wished to reassure those in his Conservative Party who doubt his euroskeptic zeal.
Even so, Cameron’s supposed remark that the UK was more likely to leave the EU if Juncker’s candidacy succeeded was strange and disquieting, not least because any renegotiation of the terms of British membership will be carried out primarily with other member states, not with the Commission.
Cameron’s bid to thwart Juncker’s candidacy mirrored his unsuccessful attempt to prevent the adoption of the EU’s fiscal compact in 2012.
He overestimated German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s willingness and ability to support the British position.
Many influential Germans are reluctant to help Cameron in what they regard as his self-created European problem.
They will not allow Merkel much latitude here, even if she seeks it.
If Cameron’s advisers overestimated the support that they might have received from Merkel and others, they clearly underestimated the power and effectiveness of the European Parliament.
For many months, the European Parliament had made it clear that it had specific ideas about how it would exercise its new powers, granted by the Treaty of Lisbon, over the Commission presidency.
But the rapid post-election agreement among the Parliament’s major political groups to support Juncker caught Cameron off guard.
Far from enhancing British influence, threats of withdrawal have undermined the Cameron government’s credibility and influence within the EU, as colleagues have become disinclined to engage in significant compromises with a UK that may not be a member in two years.
Traditionally, EU heads of state and governments try to help one another with their domestic political problems.
But there is a growing sense in the European Council that Cameron is abusing this goodwill.
Thus, Cameron’s claim that Juncker’s election would make it more difficult to ensure the UK’s continued EU membership risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.
To present Juncker’s candidacy as a matter of high political principle, with Cameron heroically but unsuccessfully standing alone against the dark forces of federalism and centralization, could have only reinforced English feelings of alienation from Europe.
That is less likely to be the case in Scotland.
If Cameron returns as prime minister after the general election in 2015, he will face an uphill battle in renegotiating the terms of British EU membership, owing to resistance not only from his European partners, but also from his own Conservative Party, which is close to advocating British withdrawal.
Indeed, it is difficult to see how a re-elected Cameron could maintain the Conservative Party’s unity without endorsing a “no” vote in the referendum on the outcome of his own renegotiation.
Britain’s EU membership will be one of the major issues at stake in next year’s election.
It would be a tragedy if British voters cast their ballots without fully understanding the European implications of their choice.
One thing, however, seems certain: If Scotland votes for independence in September, a referendum within the rump UK on continued EU membership would be even less likely to produce a victory for those who wish to remain.

How Women Can Break the Bias
MONROVIA – Since 1911, societies around the world have dedicated days, months, and even decades (in Africa’s case) to celebrating women’s achievements and promoting solutions to new and persistent challenges.
But over the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded the plight of women to outsize proportions, sharply highlighting the urgency of this year’s International Women’s Day theme: “Break the Bias.”
The onus is on us, the world’s women, to fulfill this charge.
Relying on our own ingenuity, we must shift our focus, refresh our global discourse, and usher in a new era for women’s leadership.
There is no doubt that women have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s costs. Many were forced to shelter from a silent enemy that we now know to be less lethal than their own closest kin.
Many women were victims of what UN Women calls the “shadow pandemic,” suffering beatings, rape, insults, and psychological trauma in what should have been a safe haven from a biological scourge.
Among the more staggering statistics from this period is one documenting the number of women who didn’t suffer or witness domestic violence: one in ten.
You read that right: In Liberia, just one in ten survey respondents reported not witnessing sexual or gender-based violence, and only two in ten reported not experiencing it, during the COVID lockdown.
There is a clear inverse correlation between education and susceptibility to sexual and gender-based violence.
Less-educated cohorts are generally more vulnerable, because they tend to have low economic and political agency and scant access to the health systems that could detect and address risks.
These women suffer alone but together, listening to each other’s cries through windows and walls.
Despite the structural disadvantages we face, women have risen to the occasion.
In government, we have swiftly established unpopular but undoubtedly effective measures to curb the spread of COVID-19.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is but one of the many women leaders stretching the bounds of ingenuity and determination to save lives.
From Ethiopia, Germany, and Slovakia to Denmark, Namibia, and Finland, the world’s 21 women heads of state and government serving when the pandemic erupted led the charge against it with transparency and integrity, outstripping their male counterparts with effective public-health policies.
Health systems, too, benefited from women’s leadership.
Liberia’s director-general of the General Services Agency, Mary Broh, has shown unshakeable tenacity, setting up web-based tracking tools to take stock of COVID-19 cases, treatments, vaccinations, and supplies, and running a city-wide cleanup drive in Monrovia ahead of the country’s bicentennial celebrations.
Liberian women broke protocols and traditions to save lives, bridging the gaps between time-honored systems and the needs of the moment.
While others were focused solely on the pandemic, women leaders took the initiative to set up maternal centers at COVID-19 points of care, minimizing infant mortality.
They also enlisted religious communities’ support to establish testing centers, widening the net of outbreak control points.
Throughout the pandemic, women have shattered the myth that strategies based on compassion and consensus-building are weak and ineffectual.
Adaptable and sensitive to the demands of the moment, women leaders have used these qualities to build unity and support for lifesaving behaviors.
Rather than being defeated by the double standards held against us, women leaders have remained humble, diligent, and collegial.
But above all, they have been consistent and decisive.
Moreover, we have been learning from our experiences to assess accurately the uneven social and political terrain on which we operate, so that we can approach our conditions more strategically.
In addition to sharpening our awareness of the difference between pandemic and endemic, COVID-19 and flu, we have also directed more attention to sexual and gender-based violence.
This problem has long been considered endemic – a cyclical scourge flowing from the honeymoon to the hospital.
We should now treat it the same way we do a virus.
That means isolating perpetrators and bringing them to justice, establishing systems to detect and address cases, and engaging with communities to stop the spread.
We must devise curative and preventive measures that include men and boys, so that a lasting cultural transformation occurs.
The post-pandemic road ahead is long.
Navigating it demands women’s perseverance and strategic acumen.
We must target and reform the justice and social systems that have left women to the wolves, and we must harness the indirect, outsize force that politically and economically empowered women can bring to bear against violence.
We must crowd legislatures and government offices with women, creating a critical mass that can shift the paradigm on justice, peace, security, and health.
Breaking the bias may not lead to an immediate ceasefire in domestic settings.
But with more women leading at every level and in every sector, we will gradually increase our collective access to education, gainful employment, and all the other resources needed to help women escape violence.
If you are a woman reading this, we challenge you to consider pursuing a public leadership role, starting in your own community.
We dare you, and we believe in you.
The world is yours to win.

The Cost of America’s Free Lunch
BRUSSELS – For decades, the world has complained that the dollar’s role as global reserve currency has given the United States, in a term usually attributed to Charles de Gaulle but actually coined by his finance minister, Valery Giscard d’Estaing, an “exorbitant privilege.”
As long as exchange rates were fixed under the Bretton Woods system, the nature of that privilege was clear: the US was the only country that could freely determine its own monetary policy.
All others had to adapt to the policy dictated by the US.
This changed with the advent of floating exchange rates in the early 1970’s, which allowed more stability-conscious countries, such as Germany, to decouple from a US monetary policy that they considered too inflationary.
But, even under floating exchange rates, the US retained an advantage: given that the dollar remained the key global reserve currency, the US could finance large external deficits at very favorable rates.
Today, the US Treasury can still borrow unlimited amounts at rock-bottom interest rates. Indeed, the interest rate on inflation-protected bonds has now become -0.5%, even for a five-year maturity!
The US government is thus essentially being paid in real terms to take investors’ money – a generous offer that it is accepting on a huge scale, in the hope that channeling these resources to American consumers will boost household spending and thus generate more jobs.
The US seems to have come as close as one can imagine to getting the proverbial “free lunch” – except that, as economists are fond of pointing out, there is no such thing.
And that is true here as well: performing the role of reserve currency enables the US to borrow on the cheap, but at the cost of any significant influence over the exchange rate, which is determined by the rest of the world’s demand for dollar assets.
Germany discovered this during the 1960’s and 1970’s, and resisted the Deutschemark’s trend toward becoming an international reserve currency.
The German authorities feared that the country’s export-oriented economy would suffer from the wide exchange-rate swings that are the norm for global reserve currencies.
Given the weakness of other European currencies, however, and Germany’s desire to keep markets open, there was very little that its officials could do.
As the DM became a major international reserve currency during the 1980’s and 1990’s, large gyrations in the dollar exchange rate did, indeed, have at times a dramatic impact on the German economy.
One reason why Germany agreed to merge the DM into the euro was the hope that a monetary union would distribute the burden of the reserve-currency role over a wider area.
The US economy is still rather closed (imports and exports account on average for only about 15% of GDP), and historically exports have never been the main engine of its growth.
This is why the traditional US stance has been: “It is our exchange rate, but your problem.”
So why is the US now singing a different tune?
The answer is obvious: America’s high unemployment rate, which hovers between 9% and 10%.
This is the price that the US must pay for its lunch: Americans can continue to consume a lot, but the jobs are elsewhere.
Today, China has replaced Germany (and Japan) as the world’s top exporter – but with one difference: it manages its exchange rate tightly, using capital controls and massive intervention in currency markets.
As the only major economy with capital controls, China has created its own “exorbitant privilege”: it can determine its exchange rate because no other big countries impose capital controls.
The two global economic superpowers resent each other’s “exorbitant privilege.”
The US would like to have the Chinese jobs, and the Chinese would like to have better investment opportunities.
Neither side is budging, although either could easily break the impasse.
The Chinese could abolish capital controls and let the renminbi’s exchange rate float.
But the US could easily end China’s privilege by restricting sales of Treasury (and other US) debt to the Chinese monetary authorities.
In doing so, the US would break no international commitments and would not start a trade war.
Such a move is likely to be effective, given the sheer size of Chinese interventions (hundreds of billions of US dollars annually), which could not easily be recycled through offshore banks without exposing the China’s central bank to many other risks.
Prohibiting the Chinese authorities from buying US debt would, of course, be tantamount to imposing capital controls, thereby breaking China’s monopoly on such instruments.
But it might also mean an end to America’s position at the center of the world’s financial system – and thus an end to its own “exorbitant privilege.”
There really is no free lunch.
The US must choose between job creation, which requires a more competitive exchange rate, and cheap financing of its external and fiscal deficits.
While China and the US battle it out, each trying to retain its own “exorbitant privilege,” Europe seems to be stuck in the middle, suffering from the same disadvantages of the US position, but enjoying none of its privileges.
The euro is also a global reserve currency (albeit of secondary importance), but most eurozone governments’ financing costs are much higher than what the US Treasury pays.
This is one of the costs of the incomplete nature of financial integration in Europe.

Brexit and the Future of Europe
NEW YORK – Britain, I believe, had the best of all possible deals with the European Union, being a member of the common market without belonging to the euro and having secured a number of other opt-outs from EU rules.
And yet that was not enough to stop the United Kingdom’s electorate from voting to leave.
Why?
The answer could be seen in opinion polls in the months leading up to the “Brexit” referendum.
The European migration crisis and the Brexit debate fed on each other.
The “Leave” campaign exploited the deteriorating refugee situation – symbolized by frightening images of thousands of asylum-seekers concentrating in Calais, desperate to enter Britain by any means necessary – to stoke fear of “uncontrolled” immigration from other EU member states.
And the European authorities delayed important decisions on refugee policy in order to avoid a negative effect on the British referendum vote, thereby perpetuating scenes of chaos like the one in Calais.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open her country’s doors wide to refugees was an inspiring gesture, but it was not properly thought out, because it ignored the pull factor.
A sudden influx of asylum-seekers disrupted people in their everyday lives across the EU.
The lack of adequate controls, moreover, created panic, affecting everyone: the local population, the authorities in charge of public safety, and the refugees themselves.
It has also paved the way for the rapid rise of xenophobic anti-European parties – such as the UK Independence Party, which spearheaded the Leave campaign – as national governments and European institutions seem incapable of handling the crisis.
Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
Britain eventually may or may not be relatively better off than other countries by leaving the EU, but its economy and people stand to suffer significantly in the short to medium term.
The pound plunged to its lowest level in more than three decades immediately after the vote, and financial markets worldwide are likely to remain in turmoil as the long, complicated process of political and economic divorce from the EU is negotiated.
The consequences for the real economy will be comparable only to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
That process is sure to be fraught with further uncertainty and political risk, because what is at stake was never only some real or imaginary advantage for Britain, but the very survival of the European project.
Brexit will open the floodgates for other anti-European forces within the Union.
Indeed, no sooner was the referendum’s outcome announced than France’s National Front issued a call for “Frexit,” while Dutch populist Geert Wilders promoted “Nexit.”
Moreover, the UK itself may not survive.
Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, can be expected to make another attempt to gain its independence, and some officials in Northern Ireland, where voters also backed Remain, have already called for unification with the Republic of Ireland.
The EU’s response to Brexit could well prove to be another pitfall.
European leaders, eager to deter other member states from following suit, may be in no mood to offer the UK terms – particularly concerning access to Europe’s single market – that would soften the pain of leaving.
With the EU accounting for half of British trade turnover, the impact on exporters could be devastating (despite a more competitive exchange rate).
And, with financial institutions relocating their operations and staff to eurozone hubs in the coming years, the City of London (and London’s housing market) will not be spared the pain.
But the implications for Europe could be far worse.
Tensions among member states have reached a breaking point, not only over refugees, but also as a result of exceptional strains between creditor and debtor countries within the eurozone.
At the same time, weakened leaders in France and Germany are now squarely focused on domestic problems.
In Italy, a 10% fall in the stock market following the Brexit vote clearly signals the country’s vulnerability to a full-blown banking crisis – which could well bring the populist Five Star Movement, which has just won the mayoralty in Rome, to power as early as next year.
None of this bodes well for a serious program of eurozone reform, which would have to include a genuine banking union, a limited fiscal union, and much stronger mechanisms of democratic accountability.
And time is not on Europe’s side, as external pressures from the likes of Turkey and Russia – both of which are exploiting the discord to their advantage – compound Europe’s internal political strife.
That is where we are today.
All of Europe, including Britain, would suffer from the loss of the common market and the loss of common values that the EU was designed to protect.
Yet the EU truly has broken down and ceased to satisfy its citizens’ needs and aspirations.
It is heading for a disorderly disintegration that will leave Europe worse off than where it would have been had the EU not been brought into existence.
But we must not give up.
Admittedly, the EU is a flawed construction.
After Brexit, all of us who believe in the values and principles that the EU was designed to uphold must band together to save it by thoroughly reconstructing it.
I am convinced that as the consequences of Brexit unfold in the weeks and months ahead, more and more people will join us.

China’s New Growth Order
HONG KONG – Between 1978 and 2012, China’s GDP grew at an average annual rate of about 10% – from $341 billion to $8.3 trillion (at 2012 prices) – lifting more than 500 million Chinese out of poverty in the process.
Much of this was due to an export-led industrialization and urbanization strategy that opened up new opportunities in the rapidly expanding cities, where labor, capital, technology, and infrastructure came together to form supply capacities for global markets.
According to the McKinsey Global Institute, by 2025, 29 of the world’s 75 most dynamic cities will be in China.
But this urban-based, export-led growth model also created more challenges than it can now handle: property bubbles, traffic jams, pollution, unsustainable local government debt, land-related corruption, and social unrest related to unequal access to social welfare.
As a result, a shift toward a new consumption-based growth model – one that emphasizes stability, inclusiveness, and sustainability – is at the top of China’s agenda.
China is searching for a new “growth order” for its restlessly expanding cities.
The current economic-growth model considers the configuration of key factors of production – land, labor, capital, and total factor productivity (a measure of efficiency).
But this narrow focus on output neglects the economy’s human dimension – that is, how growth affects ordinary Chinese citizens’ lives.
A growth order, by contrast, implies an emphasis on the configuration of sociopolitical and economic institutions – including norms, procedures, laws, and enforcement mechanisms – to achieve social objectives, such as improved living standards, a healthier natural environment, and a harmonious and innovative society.
The growth order’s stability will depend on institutionalized and effective coordination between the state, the market, and society – a major challenge, given the divergent interests within and among these groups.
But, more important, much of the growth order’s effectiveness will depend on the relationship between the central and local governments in the delivery of public services for the market.
Indeed, contrary to popular belief outside China, the Chinese state is not monolithic; it is a highly complex bureaucracy with many layers of government and quasi-government institutions that do not always conform to central directives.
The central government is in charge of national or systemic interests, deploying legal, regulatory, and broad monetary and fiscal policies to achieve its ends.
But the state interacts with private enterprises, individuals, and civil society mainly through local governments and local offices of national regulatory agencies.
A distinctive feature of the Chinese growth order is that local governments compete actively against each other for jobs, revenue, investment, and access to fiscal and human resources.
This is because local governments’ leaders are appointed centrally, and, until recently, promotion has been based largely on the ability to generate GDP growth at the local level, leading to over-investment in the economy as a whole.
Hence, the interplay between local and central governments is complex, particularly in terms of revenue sharing and responsibility for providing public services.
Although the central government may be committed to reforms, implementation at the local level can be very uneven, owing to parochial and vested interests.
For example, since 2008, when the central authorities tried to boost growth to combat the global crisis, local governments expanded their investment capacity through shadow-banking vehicles that sought to circumvent restraints on bank credit.
Because local governments receive 50% of total national fiscal revenue, but account for 85% of total fiscal expenditure, they try to supplement their budgets through land sales.
In 2012, Chinese local governments received ¥2.9 trillion ($475 billion) in revenue from land and property sales, compared with ¥6.1 trillion in other local revenue.
Compared to the private sector, local governments and state-owned enterprises tend to have access to significantly cheaper funding, with the gap between official interest rates and shadow-banking borrowing costs reaching as much as ten percentage points.
Cheap funding and land revenue have led to excess infrastructure and industrial capacity without adequate market discipline.
From 2008 to 2012, fixed-asset investment in China amounted to ¥136 trillion, or 2.6 times more than the country’s 2012 GDP.
Rebalancing the economy by shifting toward domestic consumption and avoiding over-investment will require major fiscal and monetary reforms, as well as structural reforms to delineate land-use rights more clearly.
It will also require revising the framework for revenue sharing between central and local governments, as well as transparency in local-government finance.
These reforms stand at the center of the state-market debate, because the private sector, caught in the complex interplay between central-local power sharing, can easily be crowded out.
Thus, creating a new growth order requires the central government to align institutional structures and incentives so that local governments and the market can play to their strengths.
The market must be allowed the space to innovate, while the state must implement the necessary institutional and procedural reforms.
Striking the right balance between market-based product innovation and state-led institutional innovation will be the main challenge that China faces in the years ahead.

Germany’s Four Neins
BERLIN – Germany’s stance toward Europe has become one of rejection and disengagement.
Its policymakers deny the eurozone’s crisis-ridden countries a more active fiscal policy; refuse to support a European investment agenda to generate demand and growth; have declared a fiscal surplus, rather than faster potential growth, as their primary domestic goal; and have begun turning against the European Central Bank (ECB) in the struggle against deflation and a credit crunch.
On all four counts, Germany is wrong.
To be sure, Germany is justified in rejecting narrow-minded calls by France and Italy for unconditional fiscal expansion.
After all, fiscal stimulus can work only if it supports private investment and is accompanied by much more ambitious structural reforms – the kind of reforms that France and Italy are currently resisting.
But Germany has all of the leverage it needs to implement the stability-oriented reforms that it wants for Europe.
For starters, Germany, together with the European Commission, can compel France to pursue deeper reforms in exchange for more time to consolidate its deficit.
Germany cannot, however, indulge its obsession with supply-side reforms without also pursuing growth-enhancing policies.
As Germany knows from its own experience in the early 2000s, the benefits of supply-side reforms – namely, improved competitiveness and higher long-term growth rates – take a long time to emerge.
Time is a luxury that Europe does not have.
With every month that the economy loses productive capacity, the likelihood of stagnation and deflation rises.
The key to ending the European crisis is a stimulus plan that addresses deficiencies on both the supply and demand sides.
That is why Germany’s refusal to help find a way to finance the proposed European investment agenda – which, for a limited time, would fund productive private investment – is a mistake.
Equally problematic is Germany’s focus on maintaining a fiscal surplus.
With projections for German GDP growth this year and next revised downward by more than 0.6 percentage points in the last few months, the government could be forced to initiate a pro-cyclical fiscal policy to achieve its goal, inducing even lower growth at home and throughout the eurozone.
Given that the German economy’s output gap remains negative, the government should be implementing expansionary fiscal policy that targets the country’s infrastructure weaknesses.
In this sense, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s plan to spend an additional €10 billion ($12.5 billion) on public investment in 2016-2018 is a step in the right direction.
But, at just 0.1% of Germany’s annual GDP, Schäuble’s scheme looks more like an attempt to quiet criticism from the rest of Europe than a genuine policy shift.
Germany’s fourth policy mistake is its apparent withdrawal of support for the ECB.
Over the last seven years, the ECB’s actions have helped Germany’s economy and taxpayers as much as those of its neighbors.
Moreover, the claim that the ECB’s purchases of asset-backed securities amount to “toxic loans” that transfer risk to German taxpayers is unfounded; after all, there have been almost no defaults since 2008.
Germany’s leaders need to recognize this – and to defend the ECB publicly from baseless fear mongering.
Failure to do so may reflect an effort to forestall the rise of the far-right anti-European political forces, particularly the Alternative for Germany.
But this strategy merely plays into the party’s hands.
If Germany refuses to take a more reasoned approach, it risks undermining the ECB’s credibility, thereby reducing the effectiveness of its measures.
If that happens, the ECB may well be compelled to initiate large-scale purchases of eurozone government bonds through its so-called “outright monetary transactions” scheme – a plan that many German policymakers and economists staunchly oppose.
The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need, while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone.
And it has the authority to bolster the ECB’s credibility and thus its efforts to ensure future price stability and prevent financial contagion.
Europe needs a grand bargain, involving close coordination on structural reforms and fiscal and monetary policy.
Germany’s relative economic and political stability, far from enabling it to disengage from such efforts, makes it among the most important protagonists in their development and implementation.
The question is whether Germany’s leaders will recognize this before Europe’s economy falls into an even deeper slump.

Post-Pandemic Recovery Must Include the Care Economy
BUENOS AIRES/WASHINGTON, DC – The COVID-19 pandemic may have slowed the global economy in 2020, but the “care economy” was working harder than ever.
For too long, economists and policymakers have ignored this segment.
Economic models account for the goods and services sold in the market and the workers who produce them, earn income, and pay taxes.
But the labor that enables those workers to be fed, cared for as children, and supported when sick is nearly invisible in official data.
The reason is simple: much of the work in the care economy is not financially compensated.
Unpaid work is not included in the System of National Accounts or gross domestic product.
The economists who crafted these metrics focused mainly on the value of market transactions.
This perspective, which ignores unpaid contributions, has long been institutionalized in conventional economic analysis.
The pandemic has made its shortcomings impossible to ignore any longer.
Efforts to remedy society’s undervaluation of care work have been underway since the 1990s.
The collection of time-use data in over 90 countries around the world has helped us learn more about unpaid labor, which is primarily done by women.
While this valuable information can be used to evaluate a wide range of fiscal, labor, and social policies, time-use data are underused in planning and analysis.
The care sector for the most part remains unaccounted for in standard policy tools.
But there are some exceptions.
Late last year, Argentina’s Ministry of Economy reported that unpaid care and domestic work amounts to 15.9% of GDP, making it the economy’s largest sector, followed by industry (13.2%), and commerce (13%).
If the vast number of domestic tasks carried out in Argentine homes every day were compensated, the sector would contribute $67.4 billion to the country’s GDP.
Unsurprisingly, the ministry found that 75.7% of the tasks are carried out by women, who perform about 96 million hours of unpaid household and care work per day.
The ministry also analyzes how the sector’s economic importance grew during the pandemic.
During the country’s lockdown, the care economy played an essential role in sustaining society.
While activity plummeted in many economic sectors, the amount of care work increased by 5.9%, accounting for the equivalent of 21.8% of GDP.
Working parents, especially mothers, were often forced to give up paid jobs to care for children or sick relatives.
But the pandemic merely exposed the tip of the iceberg of the “care crisis.”
South Korea shows what can happen when policymakers fail to give the care economy its due.
Although the government has invested in childcare and long-term care services over the past few decades, spending remains inadequate and policies are heavily reliant on the private sector, where workers are poorly paid.
In the absence of effective infrastructure for quality and affordable childcare and eldercare, women spend many hours caring for others.
And they are not having children.
South Korea has the world’s lowest birthrate – just 0.84 per woman.
In the United States, there are two models of public investment in care that are worth examining.
Support for childcare for working families and universal preschool for three- and four-year-olds has been included in the proposed ten-year, $3.5 trillion budget plan working its way through Congress – part of a $726 billion long-term investment in social infrastructure.
While this is a step in the right direction, a reliable and affordable care system for working families must be accompanied by high-quality and well-paid jobs in the sector.
Increased funding will not alter structural labor-market problems.
A more holistic approach can be found in Oregon’s Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland.
The county is implementing a care initiative called Preschool for All in which a tax on top-income earners will pay for universal early childhood education for three- and four-year-olds.
It also will raise wages for care providers in an effort to reduce high turnover in the field and promote quality caregiving.
As part of its post-pandemic recovery, Argentina’s government has a mandate to address gender inequalities through a new model of fiscal policies.
Its effort to account for the role of care in the overall economy should be a beacon for the rest of the world.
As the old adage has it, what gets measured gets managed.
Devising ways to include the labor of unpaid care workers in economic indicators, models, and policies is essential to addressing an evolving crisis that, as the pandemic has made plain, affects not only women, but society as a whole.

A Murder in Moscow
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin’s “dictatorship of law” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia’s bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe.
Germany’s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense of déjà vu: just as in the KGB’s heyday, people simply disappear in Putin’s Russia.
Politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.
The fact that Russia’s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya’s killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn’t inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya’s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia’s President.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books “Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” and “A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya,” Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin’s presidency.
As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin’s enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin’s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.
Putin’s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin’s “dictatorship of law” was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.
On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin’s Kremlin cabal.
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.
The danger for the world is that Putin’s lawlessness is being exported.
Across Russia’s near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Look at Putin’s attempt to rig Ukraine’s previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin’s backing.
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower.

Market Concentration Is Threatening the US Economy
NEW YORK – The world’s advanced economies are suffering from a number of deep-seated problems.
In the United States, in particular, inequality is at its highest since 1928, and GDP growth remains woefully tepid compared to the decades after World War II.
After promising annual growth of “4, 5, and even 6%,” US President Donald Trump and his congressional Republican enablers have delivered only unprecedented deficits.
According to the Congressional Budget Office’s latest projections, the federal budget deficit will reach $900 billion this year, and will surpass the $1 trillion mark every year after 2021.
And yet, the sugar high induced by the latest deficit increase is already fading, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting US growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020, down from 2.9% in 2018.
Many factors are contributing to the US economy’s low-growth/high-inequality problem.
Trump and the Republicans’ poorly designed tax “reform” has exacerbated existing deficiencies in the tax code, funneling even more income to the highest earners.
At the same time, globalization continues to be poorly managed, and financial markets continue to be geared toward extracting profits (rent-seeking, in economists’ parlance), rather than providing useful services.
But an even deeper and more fundamental problem is the growing concentration of market power, which allows dominant firms to exploit their customers and squeeze their employees, whose own bargaining power and legal protections are being weakened.
CEOs and senior executives are increasingly extracting higher pay for themselves at the expense of workers and investment.
For example, US corporate executives made sure that the vast majority of the benefits from the tax cut went into dividends and stock buybacks, which exceeded a record-breaking $1.1 trillion in 2018.
Buybacks raised share prices and boosted the earnings-per-share ratio, on which many executives’ compensation is based.
Meanwhile, at 13.7% of GDP, annual investment remained weak, while many corporate pensions went underfunded.
Evidence of rising market power can be found almost anywhere one looks.
Large markups are contributing to high corporate profits.
In sector after sector, from little things like cat food to big things like telecoms, cable providers, airlines, and technology platforms, a few firms now dominate 75-90% of the market, if not more; and the problem is even more pronounced at the level of local markets.
As corporate behemoths’ market power has increased, so, too, has their ability to influence America’s money-driven politics.
And as the system has become more rigged in business’s favor, it has become much harder for ordinary citizens to seek redress for mistreatment or abuse. A perfect example of this is the spread of arbitration clauses in labor contracts and user agreements, which allow corporations to settle disputes with employees and customers through a sympathetic mediator, rather than in court.
Multiple forces are driving the increase in market power.
One is the growth of sectors with large network effects, where a single firm – like Google or Facebook – can easily dominate.
Another is the prevailing attitude among business leaders, who have come to assume that market power is the only way to ensure durable profits.
As the venture capitalist Peter Thiel famously put it, “competition is for losers.”
Some US business leaders have shown real ingenuity in creating market barriers to prevent any kind of meaningful competition, aided by lax enforcement of existing competition laws and the failure to update those laws for the twenty-first-century economy.
As a result, the share of new firms in the US is declining.
None of this bodes well for the US economy.
Rising inequality implies falling aggregate demand, because those at the top of the wealth distribution tend to consume a smaller share of their income than those of more modest means.
Moreover, on the supply side, market power weakens incentives to invest and innovate.
Firms know that if they produce more, they will have to lower their prices.
This is why investment remains weak, despite corporate America’s record profits and trillions of dollars of cash reserves.
And besides, why bother producing anything of value when you can use your political power to extract more rents through market exploitation?
Political investments in getting lower taxes yield far higher returns than real investments in plant and equipment.
Making matters worse, America’s low tax-to-GDP ratio – just 27.1% even before the Trump tax cut – means a dearth of money for investment in the infrastructure, education, health care, and basic research needed to ensure future growth.
These are the supply-side measures that actually do “trickle down” to everyone.
The policies for combating economically damaging power imbalances are straightforward.
Over the past half-century, Chicago School economists, acting on the assumption that markets are generally competitive, narrowed the focus of competition policy solely to economic efficiency, rather than broader concerns about power and inequality.
The irony is that this assumption became dominant in policymaking circles just when economists were beginning to reveal its flaws.
The development of game theory and new models of imperfect and asymmetric information laid bare the profound limitations of the competition model.
The law needs to catch up.
Anti-competitive practices should be illegal, period.
And beyond that, there are a host of other changes needed to modernize US antitrust legislation.
Americans’ need the same resolve in fighting for competition that their corporations have shown in fighting against it.
The challenge, as always, is political.
But with US corporations having amassed so much power, there is reason to doubt that the American political system is up to the task of reform.
Add to that the globalization of corporate power and the orgy of deregulation and crony capitalism under Trump, and it is clear that Europe will have to take the lead.

Farewell to the Shadow Shoguns
TOKYO – It’s déjà vu all over again in Japan.
Despite a landslide electoral victory for his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) last September, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned only 262 days after taking office.
Sadly, abrupt changes of prime minister are practically an annual event in Japan nowadays, as Hatoyama’s resignation marks the fourth sudden transfer of power to a new leader in the past four years.
While in opposition, the DPJ bashed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for flipping through leader after leader.
With the DPJ now doing the same thing, the Japanese public is flabbergasted, and people are beginning to ask if there is something rotten in their political system.
Hatoyama’s inept handling of key national security issues played a key role in his undoing.
He alienated his Social Democratic Party (SDP) allies by opting – after months of dithering – to honor an agreement with the United States ensuring the future of the Futenma Airbase on Okinawa.
Having promised to shut the base in the campaign, and having also pushed for its removal while in office, Hatoyama’s reversal forced the Socialists to exit the coalition.
The SDP had promised that the base would leave Japan.
Not only did Hatoyama lose a key coalition partner, but the man who put him in the premiership has also been forced out.
DPJ Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa – the party’s shadowy power broker – resigned from his post simultaneously with Hatoyama.
Ozawa’s aspiration to make the next election the grand finale of his political career by cementing the DPJ as a party of government now seems in jeopardy.
The Hatoyama government’s floundering was not confined to the issue of the US base on Okinawa.
Indeed, it also grossly neglected to deal with an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Miyazaki Prefecture, allowing the disease to spread out of control.
Instead of overseeing the government’s management of the outbreak, Hirotaka Akamatsu, the minister of agriculture, forestry, and fishing, took a long trip to Cuba to meet Raúl Castro – a very strange decision given strained US-Japan relations.
That trip further cemented the notion that the Hatoyama government was at root anti-American in the mindless way that former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun was.
Having lost all support within his own party, Hatoyama had no choice but to resign.
Forcing Ozawa to step down with him can perhaps be said to be Hatoyama’s only meaningful decision as prime minister, for Ozawa’s departure from the political scene – if it sticks – is the far more important event.
In the past, Ozawa was the LDP’s youngest Secretary General.
A protégé of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, an infamous LDP kingpin, Ozawa’s political methods epitomized the worst aspects of the LDP’s old factional plutocracy.
But in 1993, having failed to gain control of the party, he bolted, along with 45 other Diet members to create the Shinsei Party, supposedly to press for electoral reform.
With Japanese voters becoming supportive of new parties after decades of LDP rule, Shinsei gained tremendous traction and drove forward the creation of the first non-LDP coalition government since the mid-1950’s.
But, as the LDP retained the most seats in the upper house, it soon forged a coalition with its long-time rivals, the Social Democrats, forcing Ozawa back into opposition.
In 1999, Ozawa seized control of the DPJ, which Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, the new prime minister, had founded.
It took ten years to make a DPJ government possible, and only by forging a coalition with the Social Democrats.
By shattering that coalition, Hatoyama destroyed the governing majority Ozawa had worked so cunningly to construct.
With Ozawa gone, not only does the DPJ now have an opportunity to renew itself, but so does the LDP.
The danger in Japan’s game of prime-ministerial musical chairs is that this political wrangling diverts attention from the serious problems facing today’s Asia.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are now as high as at any time in decades, and China is engaged in a massive military build-up.
Japan should be seeking to make a difference in securing stability in Asia, not playing sterile political games.
The rest of Asia might be content to sit back and watch the spectacle of Japan’s myopic politics if Japan’s inability to work to help stabilize the region did not matter so much.
That Japan had nothing to offer Thailand in its moment of turmoil is testimony to how irrelevant Hatoyama’s leadership had made the country.
As a former finance minister, deputy prime minister, and the product of a grass-roots civil-society movement, Prime Minister Kan has his work cut out for him, particularly as it is rumored that Ozawa intends to topple him in the autumn.
The likely ongoing instability within the DPJ makes it all the more important that the LDP seriously reform itself.
Although Ozawa retains considerable influence and so may be able to exercise his will on the DPJ, this must not be allowed to happen.
For the politics of Tanaka and Ozawa produced an enfeeblement of Japan’s elected leaders in favor of behind-the-scenes party bosses.
Of course, serious leaders like former prime ministers Yasahiro Nakasone and Junichiro Koizumi were able to overcome this “shadow shogun” system over the years, but no democracy can depend on great leaders being elected every time there is a vote.
Ozawa’s fall can – but may not – return Japanese politics to where it belongs: in the hands of its elected leaders.

A Turning Point for Europe's Constitution
For the past several weeks, attention was focused on the war in Iraq and on the fault lines within Europe that the conflict exposed.
But at the same time--perhaps because no one was looking--a critical breakthrough occurred in the Convention for the Future of Europe, where the European Union's new constitution is being framed.
Representatives of 16 countries--Austria, Ireland, Portugal, the three Scandinavian countries, and the ten states that will join the EU in May 2004--submitted a proposal, in the form of a declaration, that calls for preserving the EU's current delicate institutional balance.
They recommend retaining the European Commission as the proto-executive branch, the European Council to speak for national interests, and the European Parliament as the institution that represents Europe's citizens directly.
They reaffirm member states' equality by defending the Council's rotating presidency.
But, in addition to avoiding destructive changes, the proposal suggests a way forward for the Convention.
Specifically, it recommends a way to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Commission by allowing its president to be elected either by the Parliament or by an electoral college that also includes representatives from national parliaments.
This proposal is far superior to its predecessors.
Germany and France have proposed a system with two elected presidents--a Council president elected by its members and a Commission president elected by the European Parliament.
This is a strikingly bad idea. Creating a two-headed executive of this sort would guarantee continuous clashes between the two power centers.
The "Gang of 16" is absolutely right that the EU should have a single president, not two.
In a world of internal and external security threats, the EU will need a stronger executive capable of reacting quickly to unfolding events.
If the Council presidency continues to rotate, then the logical entity to vest with executive authority is the president of the Commission.
But currently the president of the Commission is remote and inadequately accountable to his ultimate constituents.
Fundamental political reform is needed.
Unfortunately, the proposal fails to choose between the two alternatives for reform that it presents: election of the Commission president by the European Parliament or by an electoral college that also includes representatives from national parliaments.
At first sight, these two options may seem similar. They are not.
The first alternative would steer the EU toward a parliamentary form of government, with the European Parliament entitled to both appoint and remove the Commission through a confidence vote. The electoral college method, however, could be a first step toward a presidential form of government.
The path to a parliamentary model is more familiar in Europe, and at first it may appear safer.
But in the long run it could become very slippery.
Given Europe's political heterogeneity, the European Parliament is unlikely to be ruled by a single-party majority.
A European Commission accountable to a divided European Parliament would thus be bogged down by the usual inefficiencies of coalition governments.
By contrast, a European Commission that is directly elected would have great legitimacy, as well as being insulated from political fights inside the European Parliament, thereby increasing its political effectiveness.
The main problem is that a directly elected Commission President might be premature: Europe may not be ready for such a radical change.
This is why the electoral college idea is so important: it allows for a gradual transition towards a regime that is desirable in the long run.
An electoral college would allocate seats to each country in proportion to its population, and each candidate would receive electoral college votes proportional to the vote taken in that country, either by universal suffrage or in the national parliament. This would force presidential candidates to campaign with equal energy in all countries.
Even better, the power to select the members of the electoral college should be given to national parliaments alone.
National parliaments have more legitimacy, attracting far higher voter turnout than elections to the European Parliament.
Europe would be brought closer to its citizens and national parliaments would gain a direct voice in EU decision making.
But delegates to the Convention should not stop there.
Countries should be given the option of allocating their electoral college votes via either universal suffrage or a vote in the national parliament.
The system could evolve toward one of direct election without having to amend the constitution.
Ultimately, the President of the Commission would be accountable directly to voters.
This is how the US gradually evolved into a presidential democracy, towards the mid-19th century.
Delegates to the Convention should keep in mind the provision of the Socratic Oath that reminds physicians, "First do no harm."
Beyond that, they can do genuine good by recognizing the merit of the proposal for an electoral college.

Walking with Giants
PARIS –In the aftermath of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit last year, European and American officials insisted that G20 membership was imposing “new responsibilities.”
They invited policymakers from the emerging giants to become more involved in designing a new global economic framework – implicitly suggesting that this has not been the case so far.
Yet the evidence does not support this view.
Brazil, China, India, Korea, and Mexico had already been playing a decisive role in two major areas – the global trade regime and the management of the worldwide economic crisis; the jury is still out on a third – climate change.
Few people appear to realize the fundamental contribution of the emerging economies to the success of the current global trade regime.
During the last three decades, the amazing success of China’s trade liberalization has done much more to convince other developing countries of the gains from trade than all the OECD countries’ exhortations.
Similarly, among World Trade Organization members, China has made the deepest commitment to liberalization of services, India has raised the issue of wider services liberalization, and Brazil has been decisive in cracking American and European agricultural protection.
During key WTO ministerial negotiations in July 2008, Brazil was the most pro-active negotiator.
Those negotiations failure are generally attributed to India and the United States, but most observers seem to agree that America’s responsibility was greater.
On crisis management in the wake of the financial meltdown in 2008, the emerging economies have been as diligent and active as the US and the European Union.
The deterioration of the overall fiscal balances of South Korea, China, and India has been just as severe as in the larger EU member states.
Crisis-related discriminatory macroeconomic measures taken in 2009 by all the main emerging economies other than India and Brazil are comparable to those in the US and throughout the EU.
Last but not least, the core emerging economies have abstained from increasing tariffs, and their stimulus packages grant much more limited subsidies to the banking and automobile sectors than do comparable packages in OECD countries.
The exception has been China’s dramatic stimulus measures, which, being industrial policies, will be a source of severe trouble in the future.
As for climate change, the positions of the emerging economies were until mid-2009 negative or defensive.
But India did much to change the mood when it became pro-active in the climate-change debate in the run-up to last December’s Copenhagen summit.
Just before the meeting, China announced a substantial cut in the increase, although not the level, of its emissions.
The leadership credentials of other G20 countries, such as Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey, have been less convincing.
These countries have been more hesitant in trade matters, more ambiguous in the instruments they have chosen for managing the crisis, and remain reluctant to deal with environmental issues.
These attitudes also largely echo their less convincing economic performance.
The fact that the core emerging economies have contributed substantially to shaping the new global economic framework does not mean that they do not still face serious challenges.
In particular, the huge income discrepancies between them and the rich countries endanger their own long-term growth and political stability, and could yet impair their future involvement in the G20 process.
It is fashionable nowadays to look to stricter international rules as “the solution” to most global problems, But such a strategy is not well-suited to an ongoing shift in international economic relations.
The emergence of new world powers, combined with the diminishing influence of current powers, is not propitious for stricter disciplines.
The world’s rising powers are likely to be increasingly disinclined to accept constraints that they see as American or European tutelage.
At the same time, they are still far from being able either to exert leadership or introduce more discipline themselves.
This means that the OECD countries will have to lead by example.
What, in concrete terms, would such an approach mean?
First, when reforming their own domestic regulatory frameworks, they should avoid dramatic swings away from allegedly rational markets to allegedly rational governments.
Rather, they should improve the quality of regulation, along with enforcement and monitoring.
As regulation is a form of competition between governments, focusing on improved regulation increasingly looks like the best channel of influence available to OECD countries.
Second, OECD countries should keep their markets open, and open those that are closed – in agriculture (crucial to the sustained growth of emerging economies like Argentina, Brazil, and Indonesia) or in services (crucial for countries like India or Korea).
Above all, these areas hold the key to generating more domestically-based growth in all the emerging economies.
All of this implies much stronger support from OECD countries, especially the US, for a successful conclusion of the Doha WTO trade round.
This year, South Korea – one of the best performers during the global crisis – will hold the G20 chair.
Giving strong support to South Korea’s initiatives offers a splendid opportunity for the OECD countries to show that, though they remain proud of the disappearing post-WWII world, they do not fear the new world that is emerging.

The Most Important Story You Missed in 2019
SEATTLE – According to the most recent tally, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal publish a combined total of 1,000 stories every day.
Although the report didn’t say how many people read all of them, it’s safe to assume that nobody managed to do so.
Each of us probably overlooks tens of thousands of important news stories every year.
But the biggest one that people missed in 2019 happened on October 10 in a conference hall in Lyon, France, where a gathering of government officials, business leaders, and philanthropists pledged $14 billion to an organization called the Global Fund.
Not many people know what the Global Fund is until they hear its full name: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
The Fund was established shortly after the turn of the millennium, when hundreds of thousands of children were dying from preventable diseases.
The AIDS crisis was at its height, with news outlets describing the virus as a “malevolent scythe” cutting across Sub-Saharan Africa.
Its unstoppable spread, some predicted, would lead to the collapse of entire countries.
This was an international crisis that required an international response.
At the United Nations, then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan rallied the world around the Millennium Development Goals – a set of specific targets related to poverty and disease reduction – and launched the Global Fund to achieve them.
The Fund was designed to be a new kind of multilateral venture, not just a coalition of governments.
It also brought in partners from the business and philanthropic sectors, including the newly-formed Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
This inclusive approach enabled the initiative to draw on a wider range of expertise.
Over the last two decades, the Global Fund has transformed the way we fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria – the three biggest killers in poor countries.
By pooling resources, the Fund created economies of scale for life-saving products such as anti-malarial bed nets and antiretroviral drugs.
Then, by working with almost 100 countries, the Fund built a massive supply chain to deliver the goods.
In the process, deaths from AIDS have fallen by 50% from their peak, and malaria deaths have decreased by about 50% since the turn of the millennium.
Now, the Fund has $14 billion in new funding to continue this work.
The replenishment is vitally important news, first and foremost because of the sheer number of lives it will help to save.
The $14 billion, the Fund predicts, will be enough to cut the three diseases’ death rates by almost 50% again by 2023. That translates into 16 million lives saved.
But what happened on October 10 in Lyon is critical for another reason: it illustrates how we are at a pivotal point in history, from which the world might move in one direction or another.
On one hand, the successful recent fundraising effort was a testament to the way the world went about solving humanitarian crises in the early years of this century.
Multilateralism, it turns out, worked – and worked extremely well.
That same period also gave rise to organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global alliance of public- and private-sector stakeholders that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest children.
Gavi has helped to immunize more than 760 million children to date.
And the coverage rate of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine in Gavi-supported countries increased from 59% in 2000 to 81% in 2018 – only four percentage points below the global average.
(Gavi, too, will need to raise new funding over the next year.)
On the other hand, the fact that no similar multilateral organization has been established since the early 2000s – at least not on such a scale – should give us pause.
The Fund managed to raise the $14 billion at a time of rising isolationism.
Today, many governments seem to prefer to go it alone rather than engage in the expansive problem-solving that worked so well over the last 20 years.
Brexit is one example of this.
Others include US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and his administration’s call for deep cuts to US foreign aid (which, thanks to Congress, have yet to be made).
I often wonder what would have happened had the AIDS crisis emerged 20 years later than it did.
Would we be able to create the Global Fund today?
The answer, I think, is no.
It would be very difficult to build support for that kind of initiative in this environment.
Last month’s news from Lyon, then, is part of an ongoing story.
Will the world realize that multilateral coalitions work and reverse course?
Or is the era of multilateralism at an end?
The Global Fund’s replenishment may be the best news you hadn’t heard about yet in 2019.
But unless we halt the slide toward isolationism and start rebuilding a global community, it’s the kind of news you may never hear again.

Can Trump Manage North Korea?
DENVER – US President Donald Trump’s administration, like many before it, has had a rocky start; but the most pressing challenges are yet to come.
Among them will be North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong-un, used his New Year’s Day address to announce that his country has built – and is prepared to test – an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Trump, who was still the president-elect at the time, sprang into action, tweeting, “It won’t happen!”
One can only imagine how the North Korean government might have interpreted this statement.
Trump may have been issuing a threat and establishing an official red line through his favorite means of communication; he also might merely have been making a prediction, and betting against North Korea’s technical prowess.
Or maybe he just wants to keep everyone guessing about what he will do.
Whatever his motivation, Trump has now inherited the perennial North Korea problem – a recurring global crisis that has been on every US president’s list of foreign-policy concerns since the 1980s.
But this time, the threat is real: during Trump’s watch, North Korea could very well obtain the means to strike the United States with a weapon of mass destruction.
The North Korean government is not so much interested in testing the new US president as it is in testing nuclear devices and missiles.
As its weapons program lumbers forward, it has made little effort to hide its periodic failures, marking a departure from past practices.
Speculation about North Korea’s motives for pursuing nuclear weapons is as old as the effort itself.
But while it would be useful to know North Korea’s true objective – regime survival, global prestige, self-defense, and regional hegemony are the most frequent explanations – it ultimately doesn’t really matter.
There are no good options for addressing the problem; and yet Trump cannot simply ignore it, or outsource it to China, as he suggested doing during the presidential campaign.
An effective strategy requires that all forms of US power be deployed, especially diplomacy and cooperation with China.
Beyond North Korea, Trump has also inherited difficult challenges elsewhere in East Asia.
China has continued to take a hard line on its territorial claims in the South China Sea, which means that the US will have to remain vigilant to ensure safe access to the region’s vital shipping lanes.
Meanwhile, South Korea has been mired in a corruption scandal that culminated in the impeachment of its president, Park Geun-hye.
A presidential election could be held as early as May, but there is considerable uncertainty ahead.
And while Japan’s relationship with South Korea has improved in recent years, that might change as the latter’s political situation evolves.
For Trump, any strategy to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear program against this complicated backdrop should include some obvious, but crucial, elements.
For starters, the US must maintain strong ties with its two regional allies – Japan and South Korea.
The new administration will have to be smart about pursuing other goals, such as trade and military cooperation, with these countries.
Both tend to be extremely sensitive to changes in public opinion, and the US must take care not to arouse grievances over secondary issues, especially during what could be a turbulent year in South Korea.
Of course, the difficulty of managing these two alliances pales in comparison to managing the relationship with China.
For China, the North Korea problem cannot be reduced to concerns about regime collapse and a resulting wave of refugees.
Chinese officials’ opinions about North Korea vary, and they are not all favorable; but an important one holds that North Korea’s demise could affect China’s core interests, if changes on the Korean Peninsula – such as South Korea’s emergence as a successor state – are seen as putting China at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the US.
After the US election, Trump and his advisers appeared to have concluded that the best way to upend China’s strategic position was to subject all past conventions, including the “One China” policy, to reexamination.
The thinking behind this approach is that China will ultimately make concessions to regain its prized status as the only Chinese government that the US will recognize.
But, to use Trump’s phrase, “It won’t happen.”
China is not a subcontractor on a construction project, and it has means at its disposal to apply its own pressure on the new US administration.
Raising issues that have long been resolved is not conducive to bilateral cooperation, and will only exacerbate the growing strategic mistrust between China and the US.
Governance is about setting priorities, and US foreign policy toward China has too often sought a broad array of goals, without stopping to ask if some objectives might be more important than others.
For example, will major trade concessions from China really do more to advance US interests than nullifying the North Korean threat?
It is now incumbent upon the Trump administration to make a clear-minded assessment of US interests in the region, and to prioritize its policies accordingly.
One can only hope that it will focus on the North Korean nuclear threat, which is very real – and could become acute sooner than anyone expects.

The Limits of German Guilt
MUNICH – This month marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Israel.
The bilateral relationship, born in the wake of the Nazis’ annihilation of European Jewry, has developed into a solid one.
But fading memories of the Holocaust among younger Germans, together with Israel’s declining international standing, have lately challenged the official discourse about “special” ties between the two countries.
David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s founding father and the architect of Israel’s reconciliation with Germany, was a pragmatist through and through.
He knew that forging a partnership with Germany, which included reparations that would help boost Israel’s capabilities, could go a long way toward securing Israel’s survival.
Of course, the reparations – which began in 1952 – served Germany’s interests, too.
The best way to regain international legitimacy after World War II was to atone publicly for the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and reconcile with the world’s Jewish population.
But the case for establishing full diplomatic relations was not so clear.
Fearing that such a move would undermine its relationships with Arab countries, and thus its objective of maintaining an impartial Middle East policy, Chancellor Ludwig Erhard’s government resisted Israeli pressure to establish full ties until 1965.
Even then, German policy in the Middle East continued to reflect a domestic consensus that Germany’s responsibility for Israel’s security must be balanced with an effort to remain neutral in the region’s affairs.
Still, over the last half-century, the bilateral relationship has become a formidable one.
Germany is Israel’s largest trading partner in Europe, and its third-largest overall, after the United States and China.
Moreover, Germany has been among Israel’s most reliable allies, exemplified by its role as a major arms supplier.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has emerged as a staunch defender of the country, exemplified in a 2008 address to the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), in which she identified Israel’s security as an essential feature of Germany’s Staatsraison.
But Germany also appears to be increasingly uneasy about having to continue supporting Israel even when its policies are clearly reproachable.
Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz, can the bilateral relationship withstand the rising tide of anti-Israel sentiment in Europe?
History has its ironies.
Post-war Germany could regain international legitimacy only through reconciliation with the Jewish people.
Today, it is Israel’s legitimacy that is being challenged in international institutions and Western public opinion for its mistreatment of the Palestinians.
The role reversal has been remarkable.
Both Jews and Germans emerged from WWII as defeated and crippled peoples, but the Jews had the moral high ground, while the Germans very much did not.
Yet, in a global opinion poll conducted in 2013 by the BBC World Service, Israel ranked as one of the least popular countries – just above North Korea, Pakistan, and Iran – whereas Germany emerged as the most popular.
But the extent of this inversion is best exemplified in the increasing prevalence of obscene comparisons between Israel’s policies toward Palestine and the Nazis’ treatment of the Jews.
A study conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation in January showed that 35% of Germans have no problem making that connection.
In what might presage a shift in the bilateral relationship, the poll also revealed that 58% of Germans believe that the past should be consigned to history, and 62% disapprove of Israel’s policies today.
Of course, Germany’s eagerness to discharge the burden of history is not new.
Back in 1998, the renowned intellectual Martin Walser publicly attacked the pervasiveness of Auschwitz in Germany’s remembrance culture, declaring that the Holocaust had become a “moral cudgel” with which to intimidate all Germans and keep them “in a perpetual state of guilt.”
Walser’s stance amounted to a desperate call to allow his country to shape a new national identity – one that reflected its resolute repudiation of fascism and adoption of democracy, rather than its highly regrettable (and regretted) history.
And it drew a standing ovation from all but one of the 1,200 illustrious members of the audience in Frankfurt’s Pauluskirche, where Walser was being awarded the German Booksellers Association Peace Prize.
The lone exception was Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany’s Jewish community.
As Israel’s policies have become increasingly indefensible, the Germans’ will to shape national policy independent of Holocaust guilt has grown even stronger.
The poem “What Must Be Said,” written in 2012 by the late Nobel laureate Günter Grass, may be frivolous and cliché-laden, but it is no less revealing of the growing fatigue of German society with the paralyzing memory of the Holocaust.
Not only did Grass define Israel as “a threat to world peace”; he also noted that he had remained silent for so long simply because he believed that his own origins, “tarnished by a stain that can never be removed,” denied him the right to speak the truth.
Like Grass, Germans – especially the younger generations, who feel further removed from the events of WWII – are increasingly abandoning the notion that they owe it to Israel to remain its silent, steadfast supporters.
Indeed, as Israel’s right-wing government moves to bury the two-state solution for good, Germans are joining other Europeans in vocally opposing Israeli policy in Palestine.
Simply put, historic guilt is no longer adequate to compel Germany to support Israel’s wrongheaded policies – especially when those policies are victimizing another group, the Palestinians.
Israel’s current leaders should take note.

The Business of Improving Global Health
ZURICH – The dramatic success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in driving advances in human health will be a hard act to follow.
In just 15 years, child mortality was nearly halved, and malaria deaths declined by 60%.
Today nearly 15 million people worldwide receive treatment for AIDS, helping them continue to be productive members of society, compared to only about 10,000 people in 2000, when the MDGs were launched.
Can the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), just adopted by the United Nations to guide global development efforts for the next 15 years, replicate the MDGs’ success?
The strong track record of the MDGs certainly provides grounds for hope.
But the new health-related goals are broader and more ambitious than before.
And the public-health situation is in many ways more challenging than in 2000.
The new SDGs set a lofty goal: for the first time, world leaders have vowed to reduce premature deaths caused by chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
This is a tall order at a time of rapid population growth and rapid aging.
Chronic diseases are the main – and growing – cause of death in developed and developing countries alike.
And more than two billion people still lack access to essential medicines.
To achieve the new targets, we must find creative new ways to address the world’s biggest health challenges.
Above all, we must develop new business models that allow society to better harness the know-how, creativity, and drive of private enterprises to help improve public health.
Companies share the responsibility for meeting these new goals, but they also need support from governments and other organizations to ensure the greatest positive impact.
The demographic challenge is daunting.
A billion people joined the human race in just the last 12 years.
Another billion or so will join by 2030, bringing the world’s population to 8.5 billion, according to UN estimates.
The fastest-growing segment of the population is people over 60, a group that is expected to grow by 500 million people, to 1.4 billion, in 2030.
Older people are more likely to develop chronic illnesses, which now account for 63% of all deaths worldwide.
The World Health Organization predicts that the proportion will reach 70% in the next ten years, with most of the deaths occurring in developing countries.
Some 28 million people die from chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries each year, accounting for roughly three-quarters of all deaths caused by chronic disease globally.
Developing countries’ health systems are already stretched.
They often lack medicines, resources, and know-how to treat chronically ill patients, who may require years or decades of treatment.
For example, there are only four oncologists in Ethiopia, a country of some 97 million people.
Moreover, many developing countries face a double disease burden and must wage a simultaneous battle against infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.
Clearly, more resources will be needed to tackle these challenges.
But in the wake of the global financial crisis, development assistance for health from governments and private donors has plateaued at about $35 billion annually, after growing more than 11% per year from 2000-2010.
And less than 2% of that money was directed at combatting chronic diseases.
The long-term nature of chronic diseases, and the complexity of providing better treatment for patients in the developing world, calls for innovative solutions.
Companies possess the capabilities and the global scale to play a stronger future role in addressing public-health challenges and achieving the objectives of the SDGs.
Some corporations are beginning to explore new “social business” approaches that will allow them to meet the needs of people and society in the developing world, while at the same time covering their costs, or even making a small profit.
Moneymaking social ventures are self-sustaining and have the potential to grow, bringing benefits to more and more people.
They are a potentially powerful complement to philanthropy, which has underpinned much recent progress in public health.
My company, for example, is launching a portfolio of 15 essential medicines to treat diseases including diabetes, respiratory illnesses, and breast cancer. The aim is to make these medicines available to people of modest means in developing countries at a cost to local health systems of $1 per treatment per month.
We will start in Kenya, Vietnam, and Ethiopia.
It is a small first step, and we will learn as we go, with a goal of expanding to 30 countries in a few years.
To overcome the many hurdles to success in low- and middle-income countries, these new types of business ventures will likely need to explore innovative forms of collaboration with governments, non-governmental organizations, and other companies.
Such collaboration has already shown that working across traditional boundaries, making creative use of technology, and developing pragmatic solutions can yield impressive results.
Bringing health care to everyone on the planet is a great challenge.
It will take imagination, cooperation, and hard work.
Greater involvement by business could increase the likelihood of getting there by 2030.

A Normative Approach to Preventing Cyberwarfare
CAMBRIDGE – A series of episodes in recent years – including Russia’s cyber interventions to skew the United States’ 2016 presidential election toward Donald Trump, the anonymous cyber-attacks that disrupted Ukraine’s electricity system in 2015, and the “Stuxnet” virus that destroyed a thousand Iranian centrifuges – has fueled growing concern about conflict in cyberspace.
At last month’s Munich Security Conference, Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders announced the formation of a new non-governmental Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace to supplement the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE).
The GGE’s reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 helped to set the negotiating agenda for cybersecurity, and the most recent identified a set of norms that have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly.
But, despite this initial success, the GGE has limitations.
The participants are technically advisers to the UN Secretary-General rather than fully empowered national negotiators.
Although the number of participants has increased from the original 15 to 25, most countries do not have a voice.
But there is a larger question lurking behind the GGE: Can norms really limit state behavior?
Most experts agree that a global cyberspace treaty currently would be politically impossible (though Russia and China have made such proposals at the UN).
But, beyond formal treaties, normative constraints on states also include codes of conduct, conventional state practices, and widely shared expectations of proper behavior among a group (which create a common law).
In scope, these constraints can vary from global, to plurilateral, to bilateral.
So what can history tell us about the effectiveness of normative policy instruments?
In the decade after Hiroshima, tactical nuclear weapons were widely regarded as “normal” weapons, and the US military incorporated nuclear artillery, atomic land mines, and nuclear anti-aircraft weapons into its deployed forces.
In 1954 and 1955, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told President Dwight Eisenhower that the defense of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam and of offshore islands near Taiwan would require the use of nuclear weapons (Eisenhower rejected the advice).
Over time, the development of an informal norm of non-use of nuclear weapons changed this.
The Nobel laureate economist Thomas Schelling argued that the development of the norm of non-use of nuclear weapons was one of the most important aspects of arms control over the past 70 years, and it has had an inhibiting effect on decision-makers.
But for new nuclear states like North Korea, one cannot be sure that the costs of violating the taboo would be perceived as outweighing the benefits.
Similarly, a taboo against using poisonous gases in warfare developed after World War I, and the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibited the use of chemical and biological weapons.
Two treaties in the 1970s prohibited the production and stockpiling of such weapons, creating a cost not only for their use, but also for their very possession.
Verification provisions for the Biological Weapons Convention are weak (merely reporting to the UN Security Council), and such taboos did not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to possess and develop biological weapons in the 1970s.
Similarly, the Chemical Weapons Convention did not stop either Saddam Hussein or Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons against their own citizens.
Nonetheless, both treaties have shaped how others perceive such actions.
Such perceptions contributed to the justification of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and to the international dismantling of most Syrian weapons in 2014.
With 173 countries having ratified the Biological Warfare Convention, states that wish to develop such weapons must do so secretly, and face widespread international condemnation if evidence of their activities becomes known.
Normative taboos may also become relevant in the cyber realm, though here the difference between a weapon and a non-weapon depends on intent, and it would be difficult to forbid – and impossible to prohibit reliably – the design, possession, or even implantation for espionage of particular computer programs.
In that sense, efforts to prevent cyber conflict cannot be like the nuclear arms control that developed during the Cold War, which involved elaborate treaties and detailed verification protocols.
A more fruitful approach to normative controls on cyberwarfare may be to establish a taboo not against weapons but against targets.
The US has promoted the view that the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), which prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians, applies in cyberspace.
Accordingly, the US has proposed that, rather than pledging “no first use” of cyber weapons, countries should pledge not to use cyber weapons against civilian facilities in peacetime.
This approach to norms has been adopted by the GGE.
The taboo would be reinforced by confidence-building measures such as promises of forensic assistance and non-interference with the workings of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).
The GGE report of July 2015 focused on restraining attacks on certain civilian targets, rather than proscribing particular code.
At the September 2015 summit between US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two leaders agreed to establish an expert commission to study the GGE proposal.
Subsequently, the GGE report was endorsed by the leaders of the G20 and referred to the UN General Assembly.
The attack on the Ukrainian power system occurred in December 2015, shortly after the submission of the GGE report, and in 2016, Russia did not treat the US election process as protected civilian infrastructure.
The development of normative controls on cyber weapons remains a slow – and, at this point, incomplete – process.

Lost in Transition
WASHINGTON, DC – Financial markets and the news media have one thing in common: they tend to oscillate rapidly between hype and gloom.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in analyses of emerging economies’ prospects.
In the last few months, enthusiasm about these countries’ post-2008 economic resilience and growth potential has given way to bleak forecasts, with economists like Ricardo Hausmann declaring that “the emerging-market party” is coming to an end.
Many now believe that the recent broad-based growth slowdown in emerging economies is not cyclical, but a reflection of underlying structural flaws.
That interpretation contradicts those (including me) who, not long ago, were anticipating a switchover in the engines of the global economy, with autonomous sources of growth in emerging and developing economies compensating for the drag of struggling advanced economies.
To be sure, the baseline scenario for the post-crisis “new normal” has always entailed slower global economic growth than during the pre-2008 boom.
For major advanced economies, the financial crisis five years ago marked the end of a prolonged period of debt-financed domestic consumption, based on wealth effects derived from unsustainable asset-price overvaluation.
The crisis thus led to the demise of China’s export-led growth model, which had helped to buoy commodity prices and, in turn, bolster GDP growth in commodity-exporting developing countries.
Against this background, a return to pre-crisis growth patterns could not reasonably be expected, even after advanced economies completed the deleveraging process and repaired their balance sheets.
But developing countries’ economic performance was still expected to decouple from that of developed countries and drive global output by finding new, relatively autonomous sources of growth.
According to this view, healthy public and private balance sheets and existing infrastructure bottlenecks would provide room for increased investment and higher total factor productivity in many developing countries.
Technological convergence and the transfer of surplus labor to more productive tradable activities would continue, despite the advanced economies’ anemic growth.
At the same time, rapidly growing middle classes across the developing world would constitute a new source of demand.
With their share of global GDP increasing, developing countries would sustain relative demand for commodities, thereby preventing prices from reverting to the low levels that prevailed in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
Improvements in the quality of developing countries’ economic policies in the decade preceding the global financial crisis – reflected in the broad scope available to them in responding to it – reinforced this optimism.
Indeed, emerging countries have largely recognized the need for a comprehensive strategy, comprising targeted policies and deep structural reforms, to develop new sources of growth.
It has become apparent, however, that emerging-market enthusiasts underestimated at least two critical factors.
First, emerging economies’ motivation to transform their growth models was weaker than expected.
The global economic environment – characterized by massive amounts of liquidity and low interest rates stemming from unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies – led most emerging economies to use their policy space to build up existing drivers of growth, rather than develop new ones.
But the growth returns have dwindled, while imbalances have worsened.
Countries like Russia, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey used the space available for credit expansion to support consumption, without a corresponding increase in investment.
China’s non-financial corporate debt increased dramatically, partly owing to dubious real-estate investments.
Moreover, nothing was done in anticipation of the end of terms-of-trade gains in resource-rich countries like Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have been facing rising wage costs and supply-capacity limits.
And fiscal weakness and balance-of-payments fragility have become more acute in India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey.
The second problem with emerging-economy forecasts was their failure to account for the vigor with which vested interests and other political forces would resist reform – a major oversight, given how uneven these countries’ reform efforts had been prior to 2008.
The inevitable time lag between reforms and results has not helped matters.
Nonetheless, while emerging economies’ prospects were clearly over-hyped in the wake of the crisis, the bleak forecasts that dominate today’s headlines are similarly exaggerated.
There are still a number of factors indicating that emerging economies’ role in the global economy will continue to grow – just not as rapidly or dramatically as previously thought.
This summer, the mere suggestion of a monetary-policy reversal in the United States sparked a surge in bond yields, which triggered an asset sell-off in several major emerging economies.
Perhaps that experience will serve as a wake-up call for these countries’ leaders.
Only by recognizing the weaknesses of old growth patterns and pursuing the needed structural reforms can emerging economies achieve strong, stable, and sustainable GDP growth – and fulfill their potential as the global economy’s main engines.

Justice Delayed, but Not Denied
LONDON – Last week, the former dictator General Jorge Videla was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his role in Argentina’s “dirty war” of the 1970’s, including the torture and execution of unarmed prisoners.
These offenses were perpetrated decades ago.
What can such a verdict mean so many years after the restoration of democracy in Argentina?
Prosecuting Videla and other perpetrators was made possible by path-breaking case law undertaken by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
The Court has required that amnesties granted to political and military leaders in Argentina and other countries in the region as part of a transition to democracy be set aside.
It has held that accountability for the crimes of the dictators is a human right – and thus trumps the impunity gained by many Latin American dictators as a condition of allowing democratic transitions.
The most recent decision of the regional tribunal, in mid-December, overturned a 1979 Brazilian amnesty law protecting military officials from prosecution for abuses committed during the country’s 21-year military dictatorship. “[T]he provisions of the Brazilian Amnesty Law that prevent the investigation and sanctioning of severe human rights violations,” the tribunal ruled, are “incompatible with the American Convention.” The effect is to require that those who were in charge answer for the forced disappearances in Araguaia of 70 peasants in an anti-guerrilla campaign.
In these cases, victims, activist lawyers, and advocacy organizations turned to the regional human-rights court after exhausting their options at home.
The domestic political and legal culture was still not ready to face squarely the ghosts of the authoritarian past.
Brazil’s own High Court, for example, had recently sustained the constitutionality of the amnesty law, which was supported by successive Brazilian governments, all of which – including Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s center-left administration – evaded seeking accountability for the crimes committed by Brazil’s former military dictatorship.
In Argentina, even under President Raúl Alfonsin, the first democratically elected president following the military government, extrajudicial executions perpetrated by the country’s police accounted for one-third of all homicides.
Similar abuses were committed by Peru’s security services during the 1990’s – crimes for which former President Alberto Fujimori is now paying.
All of this shows the tenuousness of civilian control and institutions, despite 30 years of democracy.
New democracies face many political – and often economic – challenges.
Making the police and the security services accountable can be a particularly tall order in the early years of a new and often fragile democratic regime.
But not giving up on accountability, despite the passage of time, sends an important message about human rights, and the distinctive nature of these offenses as “crimes against humanity.”
This is not just a matter of Latin America’s particular legacy.
Often, political leaders and military and security elites have proven as shrewd and tenacious in avoiding justice as they showed themselves cunning and brutal in doing injustice.
They should never be confident that they can live scot-free.
The International Criminal Court has no statute of limitations, and we rightly continue to pursue and prosecute the perpetrators of the Holocaust.
Years later, what’s at stake is not just punishment, but also political truth, which requires setting limits on official rationales for repression.
Argentina’s military regime, after all, framed its “dirty war” as an offensive against so-called “terrorists,” rather than as what it was: wanton, arbitrary persecution of citizens with diverse ideologies and class backgrounds.
That lesson, handed down along with the judgment against Videla, vindicates efforts to establish a global rule of law.
Tyrants everywhere – and more than a few democrats – would do well to take note.

Whither the Egyptian Revolution?
WASHINGTON, DC – Egypt’s revolution toppled a dictator in February, but the country’s future as a stable, functioning democracy remains uncertain.
The West is, of course, limited in its ability to shape the transition process.
Nonetheless, the potential for constructive influence remains considerable, and it should be responsive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ideas, democratic institutions, and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development.
The upcoming parliamentary elections are but an early stage in a long (perhaps decades-long) struggle to define the new Egypt.
Will Egypt gravitate toward Islamic theocracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights?
Which economic policies – statist, liberal, or some combination of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity?
Can civilian control of the military be established?
Will the regional security structure formed around the United States, Egypt, and Israel survive?
The November elections will not resolve these fundamental questions, and whether a workable constitutional framework will develop is uncertain.
A parliamentary system of government will likely emerge, including a prime minister and a cabinet, with the strong possibility that the presidency will be politically overshadowed, particularly if the presidential election is delayed.
The central unknown is the composition of the ruling coalition.
It appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parliamentary seats to govern on its own.
So a coalition government will be necessary.
The political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood (the Freedom and Justice Party) currently is the best-organized party, and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition, including Salafist elements.
By contrast, secular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project compelling visions for the future.
Although sentiment favoring a secular state is considerable, a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood will be difficult to assemble.
In the near term, the most likely counterweight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of deposed President Hosni Mubarak’s National Democratic Party (NDP) – that is, those who have not been discredited by their association with Mubarak.
Election rules favor those who were organized before the revolution.
Approximately one-third of the new parliament will comprise “non-party list” candidates.
Established networks based on family, local loyalties, and tribal affiliations will be key determinants in voting.
These circumstances may favor “non-party list” candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the former NDP, particularly in rural Egypt.
Post-election shifts in the composition of coalitions could complicate the situation, making governance even more difficult.
Power-sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate affair, including behind-the-scenes deals with the military, which will insist on measures to safeguard its interests.
The political atmosphere in Egypt remains volatile.
Expectations of economic improvement are extremely high.
The initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure.
The starting point for the West in trying to assist Egypt’s transition must be recognition that patient, long-term engagement will be required.
The effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persuasiveness of the West’s policy prescriptions, rather than on the volume of financial assistance.
G-8 countries have already pledged support to post-Mubarak Egypt, including economic aid, debt relief, and loan guarantees.
These steps are important, though delivery will be prolonged and the likely impact modest, at least in the near-term.
Egypt has already declined support from the International Monetary Fund.
But, apart from an IMF-backed reform program, if the Egyptian government’s policy framework is right, resources will flow from the private sector, including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development.
This is the message that Egypt needs to grasp and embrace.
G-8 governments should urgently and repeatedly undertake quiet, structured, and consistent communications with Egyptian counterparts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosperity.
It is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies.
The need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market-oriented economic policies (sensitive to considerations of “social justice”) and an open investment environment.
Powerful forces within the Egyptian business community are silent at the moment, but in time will reassert themselves.
Many business interests with job-creating capacity want the continuation of market-oriented reforms begun a decade ago (which produced impressive growth rates), but support broadening prosperity and rooting out corruption.
Moreover, an independent media might tend to reinforce pro-market and democratic sentiment.
Indeed, Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law, to act with restraint, and to respect free expression.
Regional security arrangements will also require careful maintenance.
Finally, countries supportive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social underpinnings of democratic process and market reform.
This depends on the development of a robust civil society, tolerant of open debate, and healthy liberal political parties, as well as active participation by women and an independent media.
Winning broad public support will take time.
Private non-profit organizations and private enterprise, rather than governments directly, are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building.
The job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible.

Islam as a Tool of Modernization
A big worry in Iraq and the wider Middle East is that Islam and modernization are enemies.
But Malaysian history over the past three decades shows that this belief is mistaken.
In fact, Islamization has proved to be an effective political means of reconciling the majority of Malays to the country’s rapid economic development.
In the early 1970’s, when it was still an overwhelmingly agrarian country and Islamization was just gaining momentum, Malaysia embarked on its so-called “New Economic Policy” (NEP), designed to help the majority Malays gain a bigger share of the country’s wealth.
After three decades of spectacular economic growth, many Malays have become prosperous and content not only through secular capitalism, but through the country’s renewed sense of Islamic identity, one which – for the most part – embraced modernization.
(Of course, paradoxes appear every now and then, such as when globalization is advocated alongside demands for stronger censorship.)
Islamic-minded politicians such as Anwar Ibrahim gained prominence when Islamization took off in the 1970’s. But the Islam they promoted was not backward looking; instead, it sought to shape a modernizing economic policy that took note of Muslim sensibilities.
Faced with the grassroots popularity of this movement, by 1982 the government of then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed decided to co-opt Anwar Ibrahim into his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party within the country’s ruling coalition.
The strategy worked well, and helped defuse Islamic opposition to the wrenching changes that accompanied the country’s rapid economic modernization.
During the 1990’s, however, Anwar increased his influence within the party, unsettling many of the old guard.
Matters came to a head after the 1997 financial crisis, when Anwar, the deputy prime minister, adopted an even more economically liberal approach than Mahathir.
Partly in response to this challenge, Anwar was sacked.
Anwar’s bizarre trial and sentencing on charges of sodomy and abuse of power invigorated the reformasi movement, as growing anti-UMNO and anti-Mahathir sentiments took hold among Islamic-minded Malays.
This culminated in poor electoral results for the ruling coalition in November 1999.
The Islamist party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), took power in the states of Kelantan and Trengganu and strongly threatened UMNO in other northern states.
The personal conflict between Mahathir and Anwar thus led to an apparent rupture between Malaysia’s Islamist political forces and the modernizers of UMNO.
So, once again, Mahathir felt pressure to adopt a strategy aimed at preventing Islam from becoming a tool of opposition.
This impulse strongly affected his choice of a successor when he decided to step down as prime minister.
His choice of Abdullah Badawi, the current prime minister, helped UMNO regain the Islamist moral high ground that the PAS had been claiming.
It was the beginning of America’s global “war on terror” in 2001, however, that brought the political march of the Islamist parties to a screeching halt, as it provided an excuse for the government to crack down on the Malay right and the PAS.
But this only renewed UMNO’s desire to portray itself as sufficiently Islamist.
So, before stepping down, Mahathir went so far as to declare Malaysia a de facto Muslim state.
Eyebrows were raised and questions were asked about the lengths to which Mahathir would go to counteract the Islamist appeal.
This trend continues.
One of Badawi’s first acts after taking over as prime minister in October 2003 was to introduce the concept of Islam Hadhari.
This vague term was finally fleshed out with a list of ten principles in September 2004, all but one of which, however, was without religious connotations.
Nevertheless, this move appeared to be all that was needed for Islam-minded voters to return to the fold of the ruling front.
In the general election in March 2004 – the first since Mahathir stepped down after 22 years in power – moderate Muslims helped Abdullah Badawi to a landslide victory.
The release of Anwar Ibrahim soon afterwards raised the new premier’s prestige further as a leader who could heal intra-Malay, and intra-Muslim, conflicts.
Since then, Abdullah Badawi has been popularizing the concept of “Hadhari,” shaping it as a means to shift Islam’s focus from its sanctioning function to its civilizing potential and rendering it less ideological.
In Malaysia today, Islam is being presented as a generator of civilization and culture, and not merely as a source of religious inspiration.
This has helped to counter extremist tendencies domestically and provides a conceptual platform for moderate Islam.
Islam Hadhari tries to project the idea that UMNO’s materialism and nationalism do not contradict Islam.
With various feints and strategies, Malaysia has effectively managed the tensions between a secular, modernizing agenda and the Islamic faith that the Malays profess.
By making Islamists and Islamist sentiments a part of the process of modernization, Malaysia demonstrates that Islamic faith and economic growth can be reconciled if politicians are clever enough not to treat them as contradictions.

The COVID-19 Balancing Act
STANFORD – For a long time, as health spending accounted for an ever-larger share of US GDP, I would joke that health economists were becoming macroeconomists, and that macroeconomists needed to become health economists.
Sadly, the joke is now reality.
The US and the global economy are in the deepest contraction since the Great Depression, owing to lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.
Citizens are confined to their homes, and only “essential” services – food, utilities, health care, police, and the like – are operating.
According to the International Monetary Fund’s most recent forecast, the US economy will shrink by almost 6% this year (compared to a contraction of around 7% in the eurozone and 5% in Japan).
Private forecasters, meanwhile, foresee an annualized second-quarter decline in the US of as much as 40%, with a return to growth in the third quarter.
If the government were not spending several trillion dollars to keep businesses afloat, workers on payrolls, and incomes at tolerable levels, the damage would be worse.
Nonetheless, US unemployment has soared to its highest level in more than 70 years.
Fortunately, fears of the virus taking as many as 2.2 million lives in the US (under a scenario of taking no action) were quickly dispelled.
Only a few hospitals, in hotspots like New York City, have been temporarily overwhelmed; with federal and state support, they have accommodated the upsurge in patients.
Tens of thousands have died, and the virus will continue to pose a threat, particularly to the elderly and those with comorbidities like diabetes, respiratory diseases, and heart conditions.
But social distancing at least seems to be paying off, implying fewer hospitalizations and deaths.
And yet, the immense economic toll of the crisis also carries health risks.
Household financial stress tends to lead to increased substance abuse, domestic violence, and even suicide.
Some governments are under increasing pressure from workers, businesses, and others demanding an end to lockdowns.
Several European countries have already begun to reopen their economies, and US President Donald Trump’s administration and several state governors are preparing guidelines for doing the same, in consultation with health experts.
Can the health and economic risks be sensibly balanced?
The risk of returning to work and school will not fall to zero until an effective vaccine has become widely available, or until the population has achieved “herd immunity.”
In both cases, that would probably take a year or longer.
Still, there are several ways to reduce the health risks associated with a gradual return to normal economic activity.
For starters, ensuring sufficient hospital capacity and medical supplies would ensure that health systems in future hotspots are not overwhelmed, as would new therapeutics that can substantially reduce COVID-19’s most harmful effects on the body.
There is also a clear need for substantially more testing, both for the virus itself, to prevent further community transmission, and for antibodies to determine may already be immune, as well as herd immunity levels.
In California, Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration has begun to hire thousands of people to conduct contact tracing of those who test positive, though this is bound to raise questions about governmental violations of individual privacy.
Meanwhile, widespread social distancing, continued sheltering in place for the most vulnerable, and staggered shifts for essential workers will continue to play a critical role, as will individual safety precautions, such as wearing masks in public and frequent hand washing.
Compliance with such protocols will be easier for some than others: elected officials, firms, workers, and parents will face difficult choices.
Actions taken (or not taken) now will produce different results at different times, and the longer-term consequences of any given response will not be easy to predict.
Pursuing all of the aforementioned pandemic-response measures simultaneously makes sense, but so does an approach that considers the trade-offs.
For example, if antibody testing and new therapeutics prove effective, these two measures combined could substantially reduce the risks from COVID-19.
Recognizing that some adjustments and temporary reversals may still be necessary, these interventions can guide decisions about reopening the economy.
Moreover, we can learn from other countries.
While Denmark is now reopening schools for the youngest children, Singapore is returning to lockdown mode, and Sweden is only beginning to impose one in earnest.
While these decisions should be based on a rational consideration of economic and health risks, it would be naive to think that politics won’t factor into pandemic policymaking.
With the US presidential election approaching in November, partisan finger-pointing and negative campaigning have already begun.
Democratic governors will be pressured to distance themselves from decisions made by the White House; Republicans will be expected to embrace the same decisions.
Either way, the election was always going to be a referendum on Trump’s performance and conduct in office.
The focus now will be on his handling of the pandemic and reopening of the economy.
Trump and his fellow Republicans will accuse congressional Democrats of delaying a rescue package, and Democratic governors of flubbing their responses to the crisis.
Joe Biden, Trump’s presumptive opponent, and his fellow Democrats will level the same charges against the president and other Republican leaders.
And yet, the biggest bungle so far was not made by a politician. That prize goes to the US Food and Drug Administration, which initially refused to allow commercial labs to develop and analyze COVID-19 tests.
Instead, it granted a monopoly to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which proceeded to botch its first round of tests, causing a delay of several crucial weeks.
Fortunately, both agencies have since improved their performance.
Looking ahead, if the Democrats take the White House and the Senate while retaining control of the House of Representatives, they will pursue a radical expansion of the size and scope of government, redistributing incomes and raising taxes along the way.
In an economy still reeling from near collapse, these policies inevitably will delay full recovery by raising costs and creating uncertainty.
That, after all, is what a newly elected President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats did during the Great Recession, despite early warnings from me and others.
It turned out to be slowest economic recovery since World War II.

Abenomics, European-Style
NEW YORK – Two years ago, Shinzo Abe’s election as Japan’s prime minister led to the advent of “Abenomics,” a three-part plan to rescue the economy from a treadmill of stagnation and deflation.
Abenomics’ three components – or “arrows” – comprise massive monetary stimulus in the form of quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE), including more credit for the private sector; a short-term fiscal stimulus, followed by consolidation to reduce deficits and make public debt sustainable; and structural reforms to strengthen the supply side and potential growth.
It now appears – based on European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s recent Jackson Hole speech – that the ECB has a similar plan in store for the eurozone.
The first element of “Draghinomics” is an acceleration of the structural reforms needed to boost the eurozone’s potential output growth.
Progress on such vital reforms has been disappointing, with more effort made in some countries (Spain and Ireland, for example) and less in others (Italy and France, to cite just two).
But Draghi now recognizes that the eurozone’s slow, uneven, and anemic recovery reflects not only structural problems, but also cyclical factors that depend more on aggregate demand than on aggregate supply constraints.
Thus, measures to increase demand are also necessary.
Here, then, is Draghinomics’ second arrow: to reduce the drag on growth from fiscal consolidation while maintaining lower deficits and greater debt sustainability.
There is some flexibility in how fast the fiscal target can be achieved, especially now that a lot of front-loaded austerity has occurred and markets are less nervous about the sustainability of public debt.
Moreover, while the eurozone periphery may need more consolidation, parts of the core – say, Germany – could pursue a temporary fiscal expansion (lower taxes and more public investment) to stimulate domestic demand and growth.
And a eurozone-wide infrastructure-investment program could boost demand while reducing supply-side bottlenecks.
The third element of Draghinomics – similar to the QQE of Abenomics – will be quantitative and credit easing in the form of purchases of public bonds and measures to boost private-sector credit growth.
Credit easing will start soon with targeted long-term refinancing operations (which provide subsidized liquidity to eurozone banks in exchange for faster growth in lending to the private sector).
When regulatory constraints are overcome, the ECB will also begin purchasing private assets (essentially securitized bundles of banks’ new loans).
Now Draghi has signaled that, with the eurozone one or two shocks away from deflation, the inflation outlook may soon justify quantitative easing (QE) like that conducted by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England: outright large-scale purchases of eurozone members’ sovereign bonds.
Indeed, it is likely that QE will begin by early 2015.
Quantitative and credit easing could affect the outlook for eurozone inflation and growth through several transmission channels.
Shorter- and longer-term bond yields in core and periphery countries – and spreads in the periphery – may decline further, lowering the cost of capital for the public and private sectors.
The value of the euro may fall, boosting competitiveness and net exports.
Eurozone stock markets could rise, leading to positive wealth effects.
Indeed, as the likelihood of QE has increased over this year, asset prices have already moved upward, as predicted.
These changes in asset prices – together with measures that increase private-sector credit growth – can boost aggregate demand and increase inflation expectations.
One should also not discount the effect on “animal spirits” – consumer, business, and investor confidence – that a credible commitment by the ECB to deal with slow growth and low inflation may trigger.
Some more hawkish ECB officials worry that QE will lead to moral hazard by weakening governments’ commitment to austerity and structural reforms.
But in a situation of near-deflation and near-recession, the ECB should do whatever is necessary, regardless of these risks.
Moreover, QE may actually reduce moral hazard.
If QE and looser short-term fiscal policies boost demand, growth, and employment, governments may be more likely to implement politically painful structural reforms and long-term fiscal consolidation.
Indeed, the social and political backlash against austerity and reform is stronger when there is no income or job growth.
Draghi correctly points out that QE would be ineffective unless governments implement faster supply side structural reforms and the right balance of short-term fiscal flexibility and medium-term austerity.
In Japan, though QQE and short-term fiscal stimulus boosted growth and inflation in the short run, slow progress on the third arrow of structural reforms, along with the effects of the current fiscal consolidation, are now taking a toll on growth.
As in Japan, all three arrows of Draghinomics must be launched to ensure that the eurozone gradually returns to competitiveness, growth, job creation, and medium-term debt sustainability in the private and public sectors.
By the end of this year, it is to be hoped, the ECB will start to do its part by implementing quantitative and credit easing.

The Forgotten Side of the War on Terrorism
During the past decade – particularly since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States – Westerners have generally considered international terrorism to be the most urgent threat to human security.
Accordingly, vast resources have been mobilized and expended to counter its many forms.
Unfortunately, however, the US-led invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent invasion – without UN authority – of Iraq underscore the primacy of military solutions in the strategic thinking of affluent nations.
At the same time, developing countries have continued to grapple with the persistence of mass poverty, endemic disease, malnutrition, environmental degradation, and gross income inequity, all of which have caused a degree of human suffering that far exceeds what has been caused by terrorist attacks.
We need, therefore, to revisit today’s global challenges from a Third-World perspective.
Indeed, a fundamental lesson of terrorist attacks and insurgencies, we now know, is that no nation, however self-sufficient, can afford to remain heedless of whether others sink or swim.
For much of the developing world, the basic instability of international relations – owing to terrorist strikes, guerrilla warfare, and the preemptive wars that America threatens on its enemies – is aggravating socioeconomic anxieties and fueling doubts about the benefits of globalization.
Certainly, we are all beginning to realize how precarious that process is – how easily market mechanisms can be rolled back by cultural resentments stemming from economic exploitation, political oppression, and social injustice.
People in the industrialized countries are already an estimated 74 times richer per capita than those in the poorest countries.
Today, one-quarter of the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of less than one US dollar a day, and the World Bank says that the daily spending power of 1.2 billion people is roughly equal to the price of a hamburger, two soft drinks, or three candy bars in the West.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 815 million people, including 200 million children under the age of five, go to bed hungry each night.
Obviously, there must be an intensification of efforts to reduce global poverty, which has become a breeding ground of resentment, envy, and despair – hence, a ready producer of violence and suicide bombers.
The G-8 countries’ agreement last year to a debt write-off for the 18 poorest states – 16 in Africa and two in Latin America – is a splendid, but insufficient, beginning.
The 100 most indebted countries still find the burden of servicing their collective $2.3 trillion in official debt increasingly hard to bear, leaving them hard put to finance national programs spelled out by the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s), which seek to halve global poverty by 2015.
If we are to close the global gap in personal security and economic well-being, the community of nations will need to cultivate a new ethos of mutual responsibility.
The Philippine government has proposed that half of all scheduled debt payments be withheld for a specified period, to be invested in reforestation, clean water, housing, food production, primary healthcare, sanitation, basic education, farm-to-market roads, ecologically sound tourism, micro-finance, and related MDG projects.
For lenders, debt could be converted, wherever possible, into equity in MDG projects with earning potential, while building up poor countries’ capacity for self-reliance.
But self-reliance will be impossible to achieve as long as the rich countries favor free markets and free trade only when it suits them.
Even UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned that the unrestrained tide of globalization might not raise all boats, but only the yachts – while overturning a lot of canoes.
The most glaring injustice in this respect has been the failure of the US and the European Union to deliver substantially on their promises of market access to agricultural exports from poor countries.
Bimal Ghosh, a former director of the UN Development Program, famously calculated that the daily subsidy for every cow in the EU – currently amounting to €2.50 – exceeds the daily income of millions of poor people around the world.
The poor countries argue that broader liberalization in the EU, the US, and Japan alone would yield benefits worth up to $142 billion by 2015.
The G-8 nations and the global alliance that America leads must aim not merely to defeat terrorism.
They must address all aspects of human security, including people’s well-being and safety in their homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces.
And they must win people’s allegiance by the power of their values and their ideals – not only by isolating terrorists and extremists, but also by helping, in meaningful ways, poor countries to prosper.
Above all, those who lead us today must create a genuinely new global order in which all peoples take part – with dignity and an assurance of fairness.

Latin America’s Forbidden Debates
Twenty-five years ago, only Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela were reasonably stable Latin American democracies.
Today, what might be considered electoral democracies are found throughout the region.
Indeed, at no time since independence has there been such a proliferation of democracy in Latin America.
But what has been gained is never guaranteed.
A military coup is not the only way to destroy a free society.
As the political scientist Guillermo O’Donnell observed, democracy’s flame can also be extinguished gradually when dreams of justice and social progress fail to materialize.
During the 25 years of the spectacular rise of Latin America democracy, per capita income has increased by a mere $300. Even in Chile, which enjoyed high economic growth and cut poverty in half, and Brazil, which lowered the percentage of citizens living below the poverty line by a third during the 1990’s, the concentration of wealth has increased.
This isn’t for lack of structural reforms.
At the same time that political changes helped spread democracy across Latin America, structural economic reforms were strengthened.
Samuel Morley of the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean put together an index that graded reforms aimed at economic deregulation, trade liberalization, and opening up financial markets.
Morley’s index, on a scale of zero to one, stood at 0.52 in 1977, but rose to 0.82 by 2000.
Nevertheless, profound economic and political transformation in Latin America has masked a deep disparity between reforms and reality – indeed, between hopes and their fulfillment.
Although this gap endangers the future of Latin American democracy, many Latin American leaders consider it apostasy to admit that living standards are little better today than they were during the era of dictators.
Their first inclination is to defend these electoral democracies on the grounds they no longer engage in killing or in torture.
But consider this: Amnesty International and the US State Department have three basic indicators of human rights — the right to life, the right to physical safety, and the right to freedom from political persecution.
They use a scale of one to five, with one representing an optimal level of human rights and five indicating conditions of general terror.
During 1977, the worst year for human rights violations, the average Latin American rate of terror stood at 3.0.
In 2001, after two decades of democracy, it was 2.6.
By contrast, the terror index for Western Europe was 1.1.
Still, to insist that Latin American democracy has been a major disappointment would not merely be pessimistic; it would fail to recognize that the most important values of a free society include the capacity to change, to rectify, and to improve.
The problem does not lie with our shortcomings, but with the way we choose to resolve them.
The role of the state, the market, and the region’s place in the global economy all need urgent attention and discussion.
Yet our leaders consider these subjects taboo.
Our first challenge is to recognize that electoral government has failed to lead to a true democracy of the people.
Our second challenge is to find the keys to open that door.
Latin America seems to lack the will to establish a true people’s democracy, and it has tied itself to a narrow market economy whose bad outcomes are readily apparent to everyone.
But government has a central role to play in the debate over the creation of democracy – one more important than its oversight of fiscal matters.
Certainly, merely returning to big government will not resolve anything, because it is inefficient and generates the opposite but equivalent imbalance.
Indeed, it may be that the framework for a state that can preside over a true democracy has yet to be created.
The same may be said about the market economy.
The Washington Consensus – with its emphasis on liberalization, deregulation, and privatization – does not forecast greater per capita income, nor does it eliminate poverty.
It does, however, increase inequality.
Does that mean we should abandon the market economy?
No, because, simply put, political liberty cannot be separated from economic liberty.
Ensuring Latin American nations’ autonomy in the global economy is yet another vital question that must be debated, because it is essential that national governments have the power to execute their citizens’ will.
Thus, the commercial and political aspects of government’s responsibilities must be integrated.
This does not require immediately creating new administrative structures, but skillful political coordination can and must be at the heart of this debate and ensuring its successful outcome.
We cannot base our actions solely on commercial will, because that limits us to operating strictly at the whims of international markets.
As the political scientist Samuel Huntington has said, “Business may bring communities closer but it cannot bring them into harmony.”
Today, Latin American states need political agreements that protect them from becoming the victims of both North American unilateralism and the global economy.
Failure to engage in critical debates about Latin American democracy will surely provide fertile ground for reviving the authoritarian fantasies of the past.
If, on the other hand, political leaders lose their fear of debating important issues, Latin America can move forward.
Having won some of their freedom, Latin America’s people should not be forced to pay the high price implied by their leaders’ failure to open forbidden issues to debate.

Afghanistan’s Feminist Revolution
On April 16, more than 300 Afghani women – many of them students – marched together in Kabul in protest of a new law passed by Parliament that would impose a series of Taliban-like restrictions on women.
The law would permit marital rape, limit women’s movements – say, for work or study – without male permission, and even make it illegal for a woman to refuse to dress as her husband wishes.
The women, facing a crowd of furious men calling them “whores” and other epithets, marched two miles under a rain of abuse and delivered their petition against the law to legislators.
Both houses of Parliament had approved the law, and President Hamid Karzai signed it.
The law now affects only the Shia minority, but threatens to affect pending legislation that could restrict the rights of non-Shia women as well.
When Western media sought quotes from the women, they frequently heard a Western-style feminist refrain: “These laws would make women into a kind of property.”
In the West, the counterpoint to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individualistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman’s own wishes, rather than as wife, mother, community member, or worshipper.
But, while some Western feminist insights may be useful to Afghani women and other women in the developing world as they resist certain forms of male oppression, we should not assume – as Western feminists often have – that our job is to proselytize “our” feminism.
On the contrary, the feminism expressed by women such as these Afghani heroines should educate us in the West about our own shortcomings.
The core theory with which emerging feminists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of Western feminism – and in some ways far more profound and humane.
In India, for example, feminists articulated to me a vision of women’s equality that was family-centered rather than self-centered, and that valued service to community rather than personal gratification.
They did not see their struggle as a cultural or ideological clash between men and women, but rather as a very practical effort to live free from violence and sexual assault, forced child marriage and bride-burning, and legal exclusion from parity.
The emerging consensus in India in support of greater rights and freedoms for women, while certainly causing some upheaval and adjustment (especially within the growing middle classes) has not yet – and might never – poison the basic trust and warmth between men and women.
Nor does it seem likely to emulate the splintered, individualized, solitary society – and the commodified sexual revolution – that Western, self-based feminism reflects.
This version of feminism – the notion that women can claim equality and still have a valued role in the home, prize family above all, and view rights in the context of community and spirituality – seems like a much-needed corrective to some of Western feminism’s shortcomings.
Ideally, men’s drive for progress in the developing world would also evolve, uniting the idea of the autonomous self with support for family, community, and other ties, and Western men would learn from this as well.
Moreover, intellectually, these women remind us that Western feminism did not have to evolve the way it did, and can still change and grow to embrace a more satisfying and humane definition of equality.
Simone de Beauvoir, whose seminal book The Second Sex laid the groundwork for post-war Western feminism, was an Existentialist who was neither a wife nor a mother nor a woman of faith.
So her work naturally posited female freedom in a secular, solitary, and individualistic context, in which “freedom” means pure autonomy rather than integration within a whole – comprising family, community, and even God – on equal terms.
The good news for all women, East and West, is that President Karzai, under intense international criticism – and not just Western criticism – changed the law less than one week after the march.
This global uproar is a testament to how three decades of Western feminist challenges to leadership have changed the world for the better.
But our (Western) moment of feminist leadership is over now – for good reasons.
We know by now what our problems are as women in the West, and we know the blueprint for solving them. What we lack now is not analysis, but the organizational and political will to do so.
So the leadership role is shifting to women in the developing world.
Their agenda is more pressing, and their problems, frankly, far more serious than ours, which makes it much more urgent for them to develop theories appropriate to the challenges they face.
If one of those courageous Afghan women who marched in Kabul wrote – as I hope she or one of her sisters in the developing world is doing right now – the seminal text for the next 50 years on non-Western feminism, it would no doubt be equality-driven and practical.
And perhaps, in its likely view of the world as being more than the sum of consuming, competing autonomies, or gender warfare, it would be a valuable challenge to truisms that we Western feminists – and the men who love us – have thought we had to take for granted.

How Much Development Data Is Enough?
NAIROBI – Rapid advances in technology have dramatically lowered the cost of gathering data.
Sensors in space, the sky, the lab, and the field, along with newfound opportunities for crowdsourcing and widespread adoption of the Internet and mobile telephones, are making large amounts of information available to those for whom it was previously out of reach.
A small-scale farmer in rural Africa, for example, can now access weather forecasts and market prices at the tap of a screen.
This data revolution offers enormous potential for improving decision-making at every level – from the local farmer to world-spanning development organizations.
But gathering data is not enough.
The information must also be managed and evaluated – and doing this properly can be far more complicated and expensive than the effort to collect it.
If the decisions to be improved are not first properly identified and analyzed, there is a high risk that much of the collection effort could be wasted or misdirected.
This conclusion is itself based on empirical analysis.
The evidence is weak, for example, that monitoring initiatives in agriculture or environmental management have had a positive impact.
Quantitative analysis of decisions across many domains, including environmental policy, business investments, and cyber security, has shown that people tend to overestimate the amount of data needed to make a good decision or misunderstand what type of data are needed.
Furthermore, grave errors can occur when large data sets are mined using machine algorithms without having first having properly examined the decision that needs to be made.
There are many examples of cases in which data mining has led to the wrong conclusion – including in medical diagnoses or legal cases – because experts in the field were not consulted and critical information was left out of the analysis.
Decision science, which combines understanding of behavior with universal principles of coherent decision-making, limits these risks by pairing empirical data with expert knowledge.
If the data revolution is to be harnessed in the service of sustainable development, the best practices of this field must be incorporated into the effort.
The first step is to identify and frame frequently recurring decisions.
In the field of development, these include large-scale decisions such as spending priorities – and thus budget allocations – by governments and international organizations.
But it also includes choices made on a much smaller scale: farmers pondering which crops to plant, how much fertilizer to apply, and when and where to sell their produce.
The second step is to build a quantitative model of the uncertainties in such decisions, including the various triggers, consequences, controls, and mitigants, as well as the different costs, benefits, and risks involved.
Incorporating – rather than ignoring – difficult-to-measure, highly uncertain factors leads to the best decisions.
When put in the service of sustainable development, such a model will often involve projecting the impact of interventions on livelihoods and the environment over several decades.
This process is most successful when stakeholders as well as experts are recruited to identify the relevant variables and their relationships.
These participants must be trained to provide quantitative estimates of their uncertainty for the different variables.
For example, experts might estimate with 90% confidence, based on available data and their own experience, that farmers’ average maize yields in a given region are 0.5-2 tons per hectare.
The third step is to compute the value of obtaining additional information – something that is possible only if the uncertainties in all of the variables have been quantified.
The value of information is the amount a rational decision-maker would be willing to pay for it.
So we need to know where additional data will have value for improving a decision and how much we should spend to get it.
In some cases, no further information may be needed to make a sound decision; in others, acquiring further data could be worth millions of dollars.
This process is repeated until there is no further value in acquiring data and a sound decision – a logical conclusion, based on the information, values, and preferences of the decision-makers or decision-making body – is reached.
It provides decision-makers and stakeholders insights into how to improve policies to maximize positive outcomes and reduce risks, such as the possibility of low rates of adoption or limited institutional capacity for effective implementation.
It is not enough simply to assume that the data revolution will benefit sustainable development.
Ensuring that it does will require recognizing the importance of rigorous analysis in every data-collection effort and the formation of a new generation of decision scientists to work alongside policymakers.

The Myth of the Shia Crescent
AMMAN – Recently, Israel’s Vice Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz offered an unequivocal veto on a key issue in the Middle East peace process.
Any return of the Golan Heights to Syria would result in an “Iranian foothold” on Israel’s border and would thus not only be politically naïve but irrational.
Mofaz’s statement is symptomatic of a perception that is now deeply entrenched, not only in the Middle East, but in the United States as well. That notion is of a hegemonic Iran that is attempting to dominate the region through an array of Shiite proxies.
This Iranian fifth column is believed to stretch from Beirut via Damascus, Gaza to Baghdad and finally from Iran to Saudi-Arabia to Yemen. Recent armed clashes between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government are, it is said, just another sign of Iran’s hegemonic reach.
Ironically, this perception brings Israel some rather unlikely partners.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt claims that Shiites are “always loyal to Iran," while King Abdullah of Jordan has coined the axiom about a rising “Shiite crescent.”
This “rise of the Shiites” and the resulting “Sunni/Shia divide” is alleged to be creating an ever widening chasm in the region.
Although this perception may convince at first glance, it is ultimately based on generalizations that reveal more about its advocates than the actual reality on the ground.
Take Iraq, where the looming “Shia crescent” is often blamed for much of the chaos.
Recent developments in Iraq allegedly point to a fundamental clash between Sunnis and Shiites in the region and bear witness to malevolent Iranian interferences.
But is Iraq really symptomatic of a greater Shia scheme?
True, sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq have escalated since the fall of Saddam.
But contrary to common perception, Iraqi Shiites do not form a homogenous block that opposes the supposedly unified Sunnis.
Indeed, the contrary is true.
In the light of Iraqi nationalism that crosses sectarian boundaries, it is farfetched to consider the Iraqi Shia merely proxies of Iran.
Instead, what we are witnessing in Iraq today is not ever increasing friction between religious communities but escalating internal power struggles within the Sunni and Shiite communities.
Ongoing violence in Basra and the fighting between Sunni “Awakening Councils” and Al Qaida in Iraq demonstrate this.
In fact, the current escalation points to an increasing political struggle between the federalist position of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki and the centralist position of Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr.
This struggle will ultimately define the political structure of Iraq.
Here is where Sunni-Shiite cooperation comes in.
Widely unnoticed, Iraqi Sunni and Shia centralists have managed in the last couple of months to form a united parliamentary platform that leaves sectarian tensions behind.
More than a hundred followers of Ayad Allawi, Al Sadr, and others have joined their ranks.
This supra-sectarian platform calls for a central government administration of Iraq’s natural resources and the postponement of the looming referendum to settle the status of the city of Kirkuk.
Change within the government is also noteworthy.
Sunni ministers who had been boycotting the government since last year have returned to their posts.
Thus, Iraq is seeing both escalating intra-sectarian violence and cautious steps towards inter-sectarian alliances.
And what about Iran?
Contrary to the blame games being played out in the US, Iran cannot be accused of an unrestrained aggressive stance toward Iraq.
Of course, no Iranian decision-maker is interested in a US-success in Iraq that might well put regime-change in Iran back on the agenda.
But the rationale behind Iran’s policy of economic, social and military engagement seems to be first and foremost, defensive.
Memories of Iraq’s eight year war of aggression against Iran in the 1980’s have not faded.
From Iran’s perspective, any future threat originating from Iraq needs to be averted by ensuring the participation in Iraq’s government of Shiites and Kurds.
These complexities are lost on many observers when matched up against the convenient and catchy rhetoric of the “Shia Crescent.”
But they have not gone unnoticed among ordinary Arabs.
A recent poll by the University of Maryland indicates that a large majority of Arabs in the region consider Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad one of the three most popular political leaders worldwide.
Only 11% identified Iran as the biggest threat to their security.
So if a Shia threat organized by Iran really does exist, why is it being ignored by those that it purportedly targets – the Sunni Arab majorities?
Rather than objectively describing the actual political situation in the Middle East, the notion of a fundamental Iranian threat is being used to continue unconditional Western support for increasingly unstable regimes.
Moreover, the overstatement of the threat posed by Iran is also being used as a convenient excuse for political inflexibility and stagnating reform processes throughout the region.
But exaggerating the supposed Shia threat has a price.
Continuous talk of a “Sunni-Shia divide” might ultimately develop into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Alarmist rhetoric may, in the end, jeopardize rather than protect the status quo in the region.

Can Fernández Fix Argentina?
BUENOS AIRES – The acute economic crisis that has been afflicting Argentina since 2018 has just produced a change in government.
The newly elected president, Alberto Fernández, inherits from his predecessor, Mauricio Macri, a severely battered economy.
Argentina is now being squeezed by a high debt burden, impaired social conditions, and soaring inflation and unemployment all at the same time.
Since 2012, the country has struggled to generate a sufficient inflow of dollars through exports.
Between 2011 and 2015, then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (now the incoming vice president) imposed severe currency controls that resulted in macroeconomic rigidities.
But since eliminating capital controls in 2015, Macri’s administration has since made the problem worse.
Instead of simply rolling back the controls that had distorted the currency market, the government lifted all controls, including those preventing speculative investment, which were considered to be macroeconomic safeguards.
Macri also promoted unprecedented debt policies, resulting in additional borrowing of $193 billion.
This included a $57 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, which came on top of a previous $44 billion loan (63% of the institution’s credit lines are now extended to Argentina).
By the end of this year, the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio will have risen from 52% to 93%, according to IMF forecasts.
Moreover, short-term debt deadlines have exerted additional pressure on Argentina’s already-dire balance of payments.
Lastly, in order to curb inflation, Macri’s government encouraged the central bank to push interest rates ever higher, to a peak of 70% in October 2018 (rates are currently still above 60%).
And yet, this has given a further boost to speculative investment.
Under these conditions, Argentina’s ship started sinking as soon as currents of the global economy shifted.
When the US Federal Reserve raised its own benchmark rate in March 2018, the Argentinian economy’s fundamental weaknesses were laid bare.
Owing to a run on the currency, the peso has now fallen 210% against the US dollar, and inflation has increased at double its normal pace, reaching 48% in 2018, with a projected peak of 60% this year.
As if this were not bad enough, Macri failed even to meet his main goal of adjusting the fiscal balance.
In 2019, Argentina will record a primary deficit (excluding interest payments) of 0.8% of GDP, and is on track to double that in 2020 (assuming a baseline scenario), owing to planned tax cuts from 2017 and reduced revenues from the recession.
But the crisis in Argentina’s real economy is even worse.
GDP contracted in three of the four years that Macri was in office.
By the time he leaves in December, the poverty rate is expected to have reached 40%; and, following the loss of 140,000 skilled industrial jobs in manufacturing and trade sectors, unemployment will be at 10%.
Argentina’s challenge now is to address each of these separate dimensions of the crisis.
In addition to bolstering growth and promoting consumption and genuine investment, policymakers also need to stabilize the exchange rate to restore certainty for investors and ensure debt repayment.
These goals are not necessarily compatible.
Argentina must renegotiate debt-repayment deadlines with its private creditors and revise the current standby agreement with the IMF, whose aid has proved to be more political than technical.
But while restructuring the debt will require an improved fiscal balance, the current deep recession makes achieving a primary surplus in 2020 exceedingly difficult.
The severe economic adjustment that it would require could be too much for Argentinians to bear, given the extent to which the real economy has already deteriorated.
As popular uprisings in Chile and Ecuador have shown, Latin American societies are increasingly disinclined to tolerate further painful adjustments.
For its part, the incoming government has signaled that it will try to stimulate domestic consumption to ease poverty.
With limited fiscal resources, it will have to focus on improving conditions for impoverished social groups through cash-transfer programs such as the Universal Child Allowance (Asignación Universal por Hijo).
Another major goal is to forge a new social pact by encouraging unions and companies to propose salary agreements in keeping with broader fiscal- and monetary-policy goals.
Fernández must show that he has the political clout to align the expectations of different stakeholders and follow through with policies that will prop up consumption and send the right signals to the market.
There is little room for maneuver in an economy that is so fragile.
Yet Fernández’s victory shows that Argentinians are fed up with the current approach, and with Argentina’s economic woes more generally.
Argentina is rich in many resources, including natural endowments such as metals, hydrocarbons, wood, and livestock.
It has a diversified manufacturing industry, whose products range from steel and automobiles to biochemicals; and it is home to an educated, highly qualified workforce that is capable of providing top-quality services.
The hope is that, once the crisis is over, the enormous potential of Argentina’s 45 million people can be unleashed and directed toward renewed growth and development.
That is the real challenge facing Argentina and its new government.

A President in the Dock
NEW YORK – In a way, the stir aroused by the decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to indict Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur is a surprise.
After all, the Court has no means of its own to arrest anyone in Sudan, much less a head of state who commands the country’s armed forces.
Nor is there any prospect that someone else will intervene in Sudan to make an arrest.
While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
But it could.
Despite the ICC’s seeming powerlessness, many governments’ leaders are engaged in strenuous efforts to block the indictment.
They do not seem concerned that the charges are unfair; rather, they appear to be demonstrating solidarity with a fellow head of state.
Those denouncing the attempt to put Bashir on trial include the large blocs of countries that are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the African Union, together with such powerful states as China and Russia.
One can only guess whether some of those joining this effort are motivated by concern that they themselves may some day face charges like those leveled at Bashir by the ICC judges.
Though Bashir may be able to avoid arrest simply by limiting his international travel, the commotion provoked by the indictment is not irrational.
The charges against him have a powerful stigmatizing effect.
The fact that a panel of judges representing the 108 governments that are parties to the ICC has accused Bashir of principal responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur during the past six years undermines the legitimacy of his continued rule.
Those crimes have caused more than 300,000 deaths, and have forcibly displaced at least another 2.7 million people.
Even if Bashir’s fellow heads of state succeed in their effort to persuade the United Nations Security Council to defer prosecution – which is highly unlikely – the charges will continue to hang over Bashir’s head unless and until he stands trial.
In 1999, an international criminal tribunal indicted another sitting head of state, Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Though he seemed secure at the time, a year and a half later he was sent to The Hague to stand trial.
Similarly, in 2003, an international criminal tribunal indicted Liberia’s then president, Charles Taylor.
He had to flee Liberia a few months later and initially received asylum in Nigeria, but is now on trial in The Hague.
When those indictments were issued, no one could have predicted how events would unfold; in retrospect, it is evident that the indictments’ delegitimizing effects had important consequences.
Of course, the ICC’s prosecutor and judges are themselves taking a substantial risk in the indictment of Bashir.
The Court is still in its infancy, and antagonizing the many government leaders expressing solidarity with him could jeopardize its future.
Yet it should be recognized that the Court’s personnel are carrying out their duties.
The treaty establishing the ICC explicitly states that heads of state do not enjoy immunity.
And the Security Council referred the Darfur case to the Court in 2005.
This was an investigation that had to be conducted, and those found to have the highest level of responsibility for the crimes had to be indicted.
Many of those now objecting to the prosecution of Bashir participated in the decisions leading to the indictment.
If the ICC’s indictment now causes them discomfort, that is only because they did not anticipate that the Court would carry out the responsibilities that they themselves assigned to it.

The Hooligan Spirit
NEW YORK – The late Alan Clark, a British politician of the Margaret Thatcher era, chiefly known for his womanizing and his hard-right views, once lamented to me the decline of the British fighting spirit that built empires and won wars.
Half in jest, I suggested that this aggressive disposition was still there among British soccer hooligans who ransack stadiums and foreign towns.
He replied with a dreamy look in his eyes that this was indeed something that “might be usefully tapped.”
What seemed a trifle outrageous then is now painfully real.
For the hooligan spirit is indeed being tapped.
Rightwing terrorism is increasing in the United Kingdom – even as Islamist violence is ebbing, at least for now.
British politicians who are against the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal receive death threats, or worse.
Jo Cox, a Labour MP and outspoken anti-Brexiteer, was murdered in 2016 by a man who screamed “Britain First!” as he shot and repeatedly stabbed her.
Britain is hardly unique.
In the US, extreme right-wing groups have caused havoc in such places as Charlottesville and Pittsburgh, accompanied by battle cries like “Jews will not replace us” (the “us” meaning white Christian folks).
The autocratic Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro openly extols torture.
Even in Germany, violent extremism is on the rise, especially in areas that were part of the former Communist East Germany.
In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown indifference, at best, to acts of political violence by Hindu extremists, often directed at Muslims.
Dictators and demagogues have always tapped the consuming resentments of people who feel that life has treated them badly.
Some people are naturally drawn to violence; only the right circumstances are needed for such urges to be unleashed.
Some of this is spurred by technology.
Hate and aggression that used to be kept under wraps, or confined to soccer stadiums, can now be openly expressed and instantly spread to millions of likeminded people via the Internet.
This type of mob behavior is not limited to the far right.
Self-righteous aggression can erupt on the left as well.
The same is true of anti-Semitism. There is plenty of it in the UK Labour Party, for example.
What is particularly disturbing about the increase in political violence in countries like Britain and the US is that democratically elected leaders are actively encouraging it.
President Donald Trump calls the press “the enemy of the people”; he urged supporters to “knock the crap” out of critics at one of his rallies; and he told four congresswomen of color to go back to where they came from (all but one was born in the US).
More recently, Trump indirectly threatened violent retaliation against the anonymous whistleblower who exposed his efforts to persuade Ukraine’s leader to dig up damaging information about former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate to challenge him in the 2020 election, and about Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.
It is no surprise that a New Jersey police chief who said that Trump was “the last hope for white people” apparently took such incitement to heart, allegedly slamming a black teenager’s head into a doorjamb.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a smoother, more educated operator than Trump, but he, too, refuses to stop calling opponents of his Brexit policy traitors, or collaborators with foreign powers.
A bill that would allow Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit is, in Johnson’s words, a “surrender bill.”
When MP Paula Sherriff criticized the prime minister’s language in Parliament, mentioning that MPs are frequently subjected to death threats and abuse from people using such words, he spat back that he had “never heard such humbug in all [his] life.”
The danger of this kind of rhetoric is not only that it makes violent people feel free to act on their brutal impulses.
After all, if the president or prime minister says there are traitors in our midst, it is not only permissible to attack them; it is our patriotic duty.
Nor is the use of abusive language just a matter of incivility – a common occurrence in democratic discourse, on all sides, despite informal rules (“my honorable friend”) to disguise it.
The most serious consequence of injecting violence into politics, even if only in words, is that it does severe damage to liberal democracy.
A representative democracy can function properly only if political opponents don’t behave as though they were mortal enemies.
Argument and compromise are how politicians must try to defend their constituents’ interests.
But you cannot compromise with an enemy or a traitor, any more than a religious person can compromise over something he holds sacred.
There are many reasons why even the oldest democracies, such as the US and the UK, are increasingly riven by tribal hatreds.
Politics is now less about interests than about culture, identity, and furious emotions stirred up in the endless echo chambers of the Internet.
Not all of this is the fault of politicians.
But when political leaders deliberately exploit these rifts and whip up hostile emotions even further, they do immense harm to the institutions that guarantee people’s freedom and safety.
It is hard to know whether violence will abate once the likes of Trump, Johnson, Modi, and Bolsonaro are gone.
It will obviously depend on who comes next.
But once people feel licensed to violate all norms of civilized behavior, because the highest political leaders have already done so, it will be difficult to reverse.
The ghastly irony of our times has been that the very people who promised to make their countries great again have done the most to destroy what made them great in the first place.

How to Pay for Africa’s Education Gains
JOHANNESBURG – Africa is in the midst of an education crisis.
Despite pledges to improve access to education for all children by 2030, many African governments are failing to fund this ambitious component of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
There is still time to address the financing shortfall, but only if new investment strategies are embraced with vigor.
Today, roughly half of the world’s young people, including some 400 million girls, are not being educated to succeed in the workplace of the future.
This challenge is most acute in Africa; although 75% of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa start school, only 8% complete secondary education.
Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where women still do not enroll in or graduate from tertiary education at the same rates as men.
These problems are well known, if not always addressed.
Less understood is the contradictory impact that Africa’s future growth will have on the availability of education funding.
By 2030, nearly 30 countries in Africa are expected to have reached lower middle-income status, defined by the World Bank as a per capita gross national income (GNI) between $1,026 and $4,035.
As countries approach this level of development, new investments will be needed to pay for health and education upgrades, and mobilizing domestic tax revenue will become a critical component of budgeting strategies.
At the moment, however, estimated tax revenues in most countries will be insufficient to cover the costs associated with improving educational outcomes.
As a result, an education-funding crisis threatens to dash hopes of sustained rapid growth and lasting prosperity.
Traditional forms of international aid will continue to play a role in the development of Africa’s education sector.
And yet, owing to the projected increases in GNI, most lower-middle-income countries will no longer qualify for the grants and low- or zero-interest loans that are currently available.
As a result, millions of young Africans will suffer the effects of a paradox in international development: countries will be too prosperous to qualify for the best funding options, but too poor to meet the educational needs of their citizens on their own.
Fortunately, the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, where I serve as a commissioner, has helped to develop a solution.
Called the International Finance Facility for Education, this innovative approach aims to help lower-middle-income countries invest in education – especially programs for women and girls – in more sustainable ways.
By leveraging $2 billion in donor guarantees, we aim to deliver about $10 billion in grant and concessional education funding to countries that need it most.
But there is a catch: governments seeking to access these funds must first demonstrate an interest in and capacity for long-term educational reform.
This approach is designed to improve grants’ effectiveness and give countries the ability to strengthen their economic resilience with a better-educated workforce.
Research shows that in lower-middle-income countries, every $1 spent on education increases the earning power of graduates by $4.
In other words, our long-term goal is broader than building schools or teaching math; it is to create conditions for lasting social and economic change.
Similar funding strategies have already proved to be successful in the health-care sector.
For example, the International Finance Facility for Immunization was created to provide financing for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.
Eventually, billions of dollars in new funding was mobilized to help vaccinate more than 640 million children and save over nine million lives.
The economic returns were also dramatic; one study that surveyed outcomes in 73 countries found that every $1 spent on immunizations translated into $18 in health-care-related savings.
The education finance facility has the potential to produce a similar impact.
Millions of young people around the world, and particularly young girls in Africa, are failing to excel because they continue to be denied access to quality education.
With just 12 years to go before the expiration of the SDGs, Africa’s education crisis must be moved to the top of the development agenda.
Government leaders routinely claim that children are our future.
If they truly believe it, programs like the International Finance Facility for Education must be given the priority they deserve.

Europe on the Verge of a Political Breakdown
BERKELEY – Europe is again on the precipice.
The most recent Greek rescue, put in place barely six weeks ago, is on the brink of collapse.
The crisis of confidence has infected the eurozone’s big countries.
The euro’s survival and, indeed, that of the European Union hang in the balance.
European leaders have responded with a cacophony of proposals for restoring confidence.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, has called for stricter budgetary rules.
Mario Draghi, head of the Bank of Italy and Trichet’s anointed successor at the ECB, has called for binding limits not on just budgets but also on a host of other national economic policies.
Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, is only one in a growing chorus of voices calling for the creation of Eurobonds.
Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has suggested that Europe needs to move to full fiscal union.
If these proposals have one thing in common, it is that they all fail to address the eurozone’s immediate problems.
Some, like stronger fiscal rules and closer surveillance of policies affecting competitiveness, might help to head off some future crisis, but they will do nothing to resolve this one.
Other ideas, like moving to fiscal union, would require a fundamental revision of the EU’s founding treaties.
And issuing Eurobonds would require a degree of political consensus that will take months, if not years, to construct.
But Europe doesn’t have months, much less years, to resolve its crisis.
At this point, it has only days to avert the worst.
It is critical that leaders distinguish what must be done now from what can be left for later.
The first urgent task is for Europe to bulletproof its banks.
Doubts about their stability are at the center of the storm.
It is no coincidence that bank stocks were hit hardest in the recent financial crash.
There are several ways to recapitalize Europe’s weak banks.
The French and German governments, which have budgetary room for maneuver, can do so on their own.
In the case of countries with poor fiscal positions, Europe’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, can lend for this purpose.
If still more money is required, the International Monetary Fund can create a special facility, using its own resources and matching funds put up by Asian governments and sovereign wealth funds.
The second urgent task is to create breathing space for Greece.
The Greek people are making an almost superhuman effort to stabilize their finances and restructure their economy.
But the government continues to miss its fiscal targets, more because of the global slowdown than through any fault of its own.
This raises the danger that the EU and IMF will feel compelled to withdraw their support, leading to a disorderly debt default – and the social, political, and economic chaos that this scenario portends.
In Greece itself, political and social stability are already tenuous.
One poorly aimed rubber bullet might be all that is needed to turn the next street protest into an outright civil war.
Again, help can come in any number of ways.
Creditors can agree to relax Greece’s fiscal targets.
The limp debt exchange agreed to in July can be thrown out and replaced by one that grants the country meaningful debt relief.
Other EU countries, led by France and Germany, can provide foreign aid.
Those who have spoken of a Marshall Plan for Greece can put their money where their mouths are.
The third urgent task is to restart economic growth.
Financial stability, throughout Europe, depends on it.
Without growth, tax revenues will remain stagnant, and the capacity to service debts will continue to erode.
Social stability, similarly, depends on it.
Without growth, austerity will become intolerable.
Here, too, the problem has several solutions.
Germany can cut taxes.
Better still would be coordinated fiscal stimulus across northern Europe.
But the fact of the matter is that northern European governments, constrained by domestic public opinion, remain unwilling to act.
Under these circumstances, the only practical source of stimulus is the ECB.
Interest rates will have to be slashed, and the ECB will have to follow up with large-scale asset purchases like those recently announced by the Swiss National Bank.
If these three urgent tasks are completed, there will be plenty of time – and much time will be needed – to contemplate radical changes like new budgetary rules, harmonization of other national policies, and a move to full fiscal union.
But, as John Maynard Keynes famously quipped, “In the long run, we are all dead.” European leaders’ continued focus on the long run at the expense of short-term imperatives may indeed be the death knell for their single currency.

A Western Strategy for a Declining Russia
CAMBRIDGE – The Aspen Strategy Group, a non-partisan group of foreign-policy experts that former US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and I co-chair, recently wrestled with the question of how to respond to Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
And now NATO is wrestling with the same question.
While the West must resist Russian President Vladimir Putin’s challenge to the post-1945 norm of not claiming territory by force, it must not completely isolate Russia, a country with which the West has overlapping interests concerning nuclear security, non-proliferation, anti-terrorism, the Arctic, and regional issues like Iran and Afghanistan.
Moreover, simple geography gives Putin the advantage in any escalation of the conflict in Ukraine.
It is natural to feel angry at Putin’s deceptions, but anger is not a strategy.
The West needs to impose financial and energy sanctions to deter Russia in Ukraine; but it also must not lose sight of the need to work with Russia on other issues.
Reconciling these objectives is not easy, and neither side would gain from a new Cold War.
Thus, it is not surprising that when it came to specific policy recommendations, the Aspen group was divided between “squeezers” and “dealers.”
This dilemma should be put in long-term perspective: What type of Russia do we hope to see a decade from now?
Despite Putin’s aggressive use of force and blustery propaganda, Russia is a country in decline.
Putin’s illiberal strategy of looking East while waging unconventional war on the West will turn Russia into China’s gas station while cutting off its economy from the Western capital, technology, and contacts that it needs.
Some of Russia’s opponents might welcome the country’s decline on the grounds that the problem will eventually solve itself.
But that would be shortsighted.
A century ago, the decline of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires proved highly disruptive to the international system.
A gradual decline, like that of ancient Rome or eighteenth-century Spain, is less disruptive than a rapid one, but ultimately the best scenario would feature a recovering and rebalanced Russia over the next decade.
The evidence of Russia’s decline is pervasive.
The rise in oil prices at the beginning of the century gave the economy an artificial boost, leading Goldman Sachs to include it among the world’s major emerging markets (one of the “BRICs,” along with Brazil, India, and China).
Today, however, that growth has vanished.
Russia’s GDP is about one-seventh the size of America’s, and its per capita income (in purchasing-power-parity terms) of $18,000 is roughly one-third that of the US.
Oil and gas account for two-thirds of Russian exports, half of state revenues, and 20% of GDP, whereas high-tech exports represent only 7% of its manufactured exports (compared to 28% for the US).
Resources are allocated inefficiently across the economy, with a corrupt institutional and legal structure that impedes private investment.
Despite the attractiveness of traditional Russian culture and Putin’s calls to boost Russian soft power, his bullying behavior has sown mistrust.
Few foreigners watch Russian films, and no Russian university was ranked in the global top 100 last year.
The likelihood of ethnic fragmentation is lower than in Soviet days, but it still remains a problem in the Caucasus.
Non-Russians comprised half of the Soviet population; they now make up 20% of the Russian Federation and occupy 30% of its territory.
The public health system is in disarray.
The birth rate is declining, mortality rates have increased, and the average Russian male dies in his early sixties.
Mid-range estimates by United Nations demographers suggest that Russia’s population may decline from 145 million today to 121 million by mid-century.
But, though Russia at this point appears to be an industrial banana republic, many futures are still possible.
It has talented human resources, and some sectors, like the defense industry, can produce sophisticated products.
Some analysts believe that with reform and modernization, Russia would be able to surmount its problems.
Former President Dmitri Medvedev, who worried that Russia would fall into the so-called middle-income trap rather than graduate to advanced-country status, laid out plans to do just that.
But little has been implemented, owing to rampant corruption.
Under Putin, Russia’s post-imperial transformation has failed, and Russia remains pre-occupied with its place in the world and torn between its historical European and Slavophile identities.
Putin lacks a strategy for Russia’s long-term recovery and reacts opportunistically – albeit sometimes successfully in the short run – to domestic insecurity, perceived external threats, and the weakness of his neighbors.
Russia has thus become a revisionist spoiler of the international status quo – one that seeks to be a catalyst for other revisionist powers.
But an ideology of anti-liberalism and Russian nationalism is a poor source of the soft power that the country needs to increase its regional and global influence.
Thus, the prospects that a Russian-led Eurasian Union can compete with the European Union are limited.
Whatever the outcome of Putin’s revisionism, Russia’s nuclear weapons, oil and gas, skills in cyber technology, and proximity to Europe, will give him the resources to cause problems for the West and the international system.
Designing and implementing a strategy that contains Putin’s behavior while maintaining long-term engagement with Russia is one of the most important challenges facing the international community today.

When Facts Change, Change the Pact
PARIS – The European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact, which sets fiscal rules for its member states, is like the emperor’s new clothes.
Almost everyone sees it has none, yet few admit it openly.
This disingenuous silence is bad economics and bad politics.
For starters, the pact’s rules are so hopelessly complex that almost no government minister, let alone member of parliament, can decipher them.
There are now various reform proposals that aim to simplify things, including by a group of French and German economists to which I belong.
Most of these proposals would place less emphasis on estimating member states’ cyclically-adjusted budget deficits – a notoriously difficult calculation – and focus instead on monitoring growth in public spending.
Concretely, each government would commit to expenditures consistent with the country’s economic growth outlook and expected tax receipts, and in line with a medium-term debt target.
There would be less micromanagement by EU institutions, more room for national decision-making, and more responsibility for individual governments.
Ministers have so far shown no appetite for such radical reform.
But there is now a second reason to overhaul the EU’s fiscal framework: today’s economic conditions are very different from those when the pact was designed over two decades ago.
“When facts change, I change my mind,” John Maynard Keynes famously said.
And the facts have certainly changed.
The pact entered into force in 1997. At the time, the median public debt among the 11 EU countries that would initially adopt the euro was 60% of GDP, while the forecast was 3% growth and 2% inflation.
The risk-free long-term interest rate – at which most eurozone countries would soon borrow – was 5%.
Stabilizing the debt ratio at its prevailing 60% level therefore required governments to keep their budget deficits below 3% of GDP – or, put another way, to maintain a primary budget balance (revenues minus spending, excluding interest payments) of zero.
Such guidelines made sense.
If growth faltered, revenue shrank, or markets started pricing in a default, there would be a real risk of debt spiraling out of control – as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis of 2010-2012 later showed.
The 3%-of-GDP deficit threshold that triggers the activation of a stronger policy monitoring procedure was thus a rough but reasonably calibrated benchmark.
Moreover, it was wise to aim for significantly lower deficits, in order to maintain a safety margin.
In 2019, the median debt for the same 11 countries is 70% of GDP, while the International Monetary Fund currently forecasts 1.5% growth and 2% inflation (debt is a bit lower and growth a bit higher if all eurozone members are included).
True, projected growth is half the level it was in 1997.
Nonetheless, stabilizing the debt ratio requires keeping budget deficits below 2.5% of GDP, which remains close to the pact’s 3% limit.
The big change from two decades ago, however, is the collapse in interest rates.
Investors were recently willing to buy ten-year German government bonds yielding essentially nothing.
Taking inflation into account, the real cost of German debt is significantly negative – as it is, to a lesser degree, for France, Spain, and most other eurozone members.
Even Italy, with debt exceeding 130% of GDP and dismal growth, was able to borrow at 2.6%, or 2.4 percentage points less than Germany in 1997.
Under such conditions, a budget-deficit limit of 3% of GDP is, in fact, fairly lax.
If long-term interest rates remain near zero for a few more years, governments will be able to run primary deficits greater than 2% of GDP without exceeding that limit.
Many EU countries are likely to use this opportunity to finance current spending on the cheap.
But should financial conditions change abruptly, they will be forced to adjust precipitously.
The European Commission insists that the 3% threshold is only an upper limit.
Reforms to the pact in 2011 have tightened the screws.
Eurozone countries are expected to keep their structural budget deficit (corrected for cyclical effects) close to zero, and those with a debt ratio exceeding 60% of GDP are mandated to reduce it.
However, the resulting constraints are too tight.
The zero target for the structural deficit prevents governments from borrowing at today’s negative real interest rates to finance investments and reforms.
And, as Olivier Blanchard of the Peterson Institute has forcefully argued, there is no compelling economic reason to cut debt when borrowing is costless.
The EU sits between a rock and a hard place.
It should not let member states make a habit of financing recurring current expenditures with debt. But nor should it prevent them from taking advantage of persistently low interest rates to finance economically sound investments that will benefit future generations.
Europe should therefore reform its fiscal framework.
Deficit hawks (especially in Germany) will no doubt protest, but prohibition without a rationale is politically unsustainable.
Why wouldn’t EU citizens accept channeling debt-financed public investments into environmental research, renewable energy, clean transportation systems, and other efforts to contain climate change, when financial conditions would make such investments collectively profitable?
Longstanding criticism of the pact for neglecting the distinction between investment and current spending is valid, to the extent that investment is defined economically rather than in accounting terms.
The EU should therefore agree on a set of goals – such as the transition to a low-carbon economy, broader access to employment, and output-enhancing economic reforms – that justify public spending temporarily in excess of the fiscal rule (unless, of course, the country is in a financially precarious state).
Such an exemption should be conditional on long-term interest rates remaining exceptionally low.
If rates were to rise, governments would have to trim and eventually discontinue these investments.
The need to revise the EU’s fiscal rules is clear.
The main political parties competing in May’s European Parliament elections should recognize it and make the case openly.
At a time when the EU’s very purpose is being questioned, economics taboos are the last thing Europe needs.

Turning North Korea Around
SEOUL – Negotiations over the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula look set to resume.
Sadly, they are unlikely to end soon. Talk of a “grand bargain” remains just that – talk.
Trust between North Korea and the United States, South Korea, and Japan is almost non-existent.
While all leaders – including North Korea’s Kim Jong Il – remain committed to denuclearization in public, none appears ready to risk much in terms of domestic politics to achieve that end.
So the best the world can currently hope for is revived dialogue, an agreement to freeze the North’s Yongbyon nuclear plant, and perhaps a moratorium on further missile and nuclear tests.
To speed the process, a new long-term strategy aimed at the underlying factors at work in North Korea – and in relations with its rulers – is needed.
Simply put, the US and other powers need to pursue constructive economic engagement with North Korea to help the regime achieve “strength and prosperity” through economic transition and integration with the global economy.
Constructive economic engagement will benefit ordinary North Koreans, who have suffered as much as any people on Earth since the Cold War’s end.
The root cause of North Korea’s economic difficulties is its isolation from the forces of globalization, from which East Asia in particular has profited.
In the late 1990’s, as China and Vietnam were posting rapid GDP growth, North Korea was ravaged by one of the worst famines in modern history.
Today, North Korea is a de-industrializing, near-subsistence economy.
The best hope for most North Koreans is the subterranean market economy that fills the gaps in the state’s planned economy and public distribution system.
Trade with China is keeping those market forces supplied with goods and business opportunities across the border.
Rather than pressure China to shut down the cross-border flow of fuel and food in order to “teach Pyongyang a lesson,” the US and its allies must find ways to support North Korea’s economic integration with the region.
More effective than freezing accounts and barring travel by officials with ties to the missile and nuclear programs would be to work with North Korea’s younger technocrats, banking and financial officials, and economic advisers to improve their expertise in managing North Korea’s economic transition.
Of course, economic engagement will not solve the nuclear conundrum in the short term. Nothing will.
The Korean Peninsula will most likely achieve “complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization” only when North Korea is already moving in the direction of economic growth and integration.
North Korea’s regime will require demonstrable evidence that a secure, prosperous, non-nuclear development model is available to it before it abandons its nuclear program.
So, as nuclear talks proceed, the US and its partners should help North Korea lay the foundations for a new political economy based on international commerce, investment, and cooperation, as an alternative to the current model predicated on a hostile security environment.
We should think of North Korea’s economic transition process as a prerequisite for full denuclearization, rather than simply holding out the promise of a big assistance package as a quid pro quo .
Of course, some of the big-ticket items in an economic engagement policy will remain contingent on progress in security arrangements and peninsular denuclearization. But North Korea and the international community can already take some substantive steps.
These include opening diplomatic and official channels in order to improve mutual understanding and the general climate for exchanges; promoting US-North Korea economic dialogues and workshops; encouraging US universities, research institutes, and non-governmental organizations with expertise in economic transition and development to initiate and develop contacts with North Korean counterparts; and permitting the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank to increase North Korean participation, with the ultimate goal of membership.
During the recent visit of a high-level North Korean delegation to the US, there were encouraging signals that its rulers would welcome increased economic contacts, including with international financial institutions.
Moreover, North Korea is actively courting foreign investment.
The United Nations Development Program recently reopened its office in Pyongyang, another positive sign of the regime’s readiness to work toward common development goals.
Of course, new sources of growth in North Korea could threaten vested interests, leading to institutional rivalries, factional tension, or a conservative backlash.
And the regime will not want the process of economic opening to get too far ahead of security agreements and political normalization.
After all, the main lesson that North Korean leaders take from China’s success is that security (Mao Zedong’s rapprochement with the US) precedes economic transition (Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening policy).
Constructive economic engagement will be a tough sell outside North Korea.
In the US, North Korea is seen mostly through the prism of nuclear non-proliferation, and the new administration is wary of being tricked into giving its rulers anything without getting fissile material in return.
In South Korea, President Lee Myung-bak’s political base wants to roll back, not reinvigorate, the Sunshine Policy, and there is a widespread (though by no means universal) weariness with engagement.
In Japan, fear of North Korea’s nuclear threat and anger over the abduction of Japanese citizens generates powerful political pressure against engagement.
China is the one place that quietly implements a constructive economic engagement approach.
Instead of pressing Beijing to cut off North Korea, the US and its allies should further develop their own efforts to draw North Korea out of its insularity.

The Syria Lessons
PRINCETON – As the United States and Russia try to broker a conference that can bring the various sides in the Syrian conflict to the negotiating table, potential Western participants, at least, should be thinking about the larger implications of the Syrian conflict for dictators and democracies around the world.
Here are the lessons thus far:
Bad guys help their friends.
The Russians and Iranians are willing to do whatever it takes to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power.
Hezbollah, supplied by Iran, has now moved openly onto the battlefield in support of the Assad regime.
Russia and Iran have kept the Syrian government supplied with heavy weapons and other military assistance, including a Russian shipment of sophisticated anti-ship missiles with advanced radar systems. These will help Assad hunker down and fend off all comers in an Alawite mini-state that will include the Russian-leased port facility at Tartus.
Diplomacy without a credible threat of force is empty talk. “Speak softly and carry a big stick,” Theodore Roosevelt counseled.
President Barack Obama rightly wants to lead in global affairs through civilian more than military power; he understands that military solutions to foreign-policy problems are hugely expensive and often counter-productive in terms of advancing US security and prosperity over the long term.
But Obama’s strategy in Syria seems to be “speak loudly and throw away your stick.”
Obama has made it clear over and over (as has NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen) that he has no interest in intervening militarily in Syria.
And the US response to the latest Russian missile shipment? Secretary of State John Kerry said: “I think we’ve made it crystal clear we would prefer that Russia was not supplying assistance.”
The US has cast aside one of its most important foreign policy tools, creating an incentive for the Syrian government and its supporters to keep fighting until they are in the most advantageous position possible to negotiate a settlement – that is, if they have any incentive to negotiate at all.
If you are a dictator facing sustained political protests, be as brutal as possible and incite sectarian killing.
Part of Syria’s agony is the self-fulfilling nature of the conflict.
From March to December 2011, hundreds of thousands of Syrians marched every Friday, seeking the same political liberalization that Tunisians, Egyptians, Yemenis, Bahrainis, Jordanians, and others across the Middle East and North Africa sought in what was optimistically called “the Arab Spring.”
Unarmed, they were shot in the streets by riot police and government snipers, until they finally started forming small local militias for self-protection – militias that gradually grew into the loose federation of forces now known as the Free Syrian Army.
All the while, Assad was describing the violence as the product of terrorists and Sunni extremists seeking dominion over minority Alawites, Druze, Kurds, Christians, and other groups.
He worked assiduously to fan the flames of sectarian civil war, succeeding to the extent that now the chief reason for not intervening to stop the killing is the impossibility of doing so effectively in an environment of sectarian violence.
Regional organizations are still unable to solve regional problems without great-power leadership.
Turkey has been threatening and calling for military action for 18 months, but US officials say that the Turks are not in fact ready to do anything beyond providing support for refugees and opposition fighters.
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also sending arms to Syrian opposition groups, but the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council are paralyzed.
Without a great power that is willing both to share the lead and to push from behind, regional organizations cannot take charge in their own neighborhood.
Human suffering, even on a massive and destabilizing scale, will not move the world to action.
In a recent conversation about Syria with a couple of well-known foreign policy experts, one participant suggested that the Middle East’s current borders, drawn in colonial times, cannot last and must be redrawn.
I pointed out the possibility of a Middle East conflagration equivalent to the Thirty Years War in Europe, which is estimated to have killed between half and three-quarters of the population of some of the participating states.
One of my interlocutors agreed, but said that we could do nothing to stop it, because “that’s the period of history we’re in.”
For all the world’s pious proclamations about “never again,” a mantra arising from the Holocaust, mass murder almost never motivates foreign intervention.
It is astounding to think that the world mobilized immediately to push Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991, but has dithered for more than two years as tens of thousands of Syrians have been killed, and their country, a cradle of civilization, laid waste.
“Humanitarian” intervention – action that is motivated by our concern for the fate of fellow human beings – is often described as reflecting “moral concern.”
But how many wars does it take for us to understand that killing always begets more killing?
People who watch the butchering of their children and parents, the rape of their wives, daughters, and sisters, and the wanton destruction of their homes and livelihoods do not forget.
They carry vengeance in their hearts from generation to generation, until a measure of justice is done, nursing their enmity in frozen conflicts that block economic growth, prevent the formation of social capital, and paralyze political institutions.
When no side in a war has a reason to stop fighting, a peace conference cannot succeed.
In Syria, the moral, strategic, and political arguments all converge in favor of decisive action to stop the killing, if not forever, at least for now, to create a space for peace.
But if the lessons of the past two years are any guide, the wheels of violence will keep on turning.

Poland’s Double Trouble
Much of the world seems fascinated by the fact that Poland is now governed by a set of identical twins who first became famous as child movie actors: President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
They are indeed intriguing, but the political forces they represent are even more interesting – and worrying.
Since the fall of 2005, the Kaczynskis have led a conservative-populist coalition, with a dose of nationalism – represented by the small League of Polish Families (LPR) – thrown in.
The Polish right was last in power in 1997, having previously governed in the years 1990-1993.
The post-communist Party of the Democratic Left (SLD) was voted out in 1997, despite a five-year streak of economic prosperity and rapidly falling unemployment.
Although the SLD’s popularity remained high, the previously fragmented right prevailed due to temporary unity.
In 1998, however, prosperity vanished. So the right’s turn in government was followed by years of stagnation and exploding unemployment.
Unable to cope with the downturn, the right was replaced by another SLD-led government in 2001.
During this period, the right disintegrated.
Among the splinter groups that arose were the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) and the nationalist LPR.
As they emerged on the political stage, the left was failing: the economy did not improve, unemployment remained high, and the SLD, which attracted all kinds of riffraff, became mired in corruption scandals.
The scandals provided the right with an opportunity to deliver a coup de grace to the SLD in the form of parliamentary investigative commissions.
The hearings, reminiscent of Joe McCarthy’s witch hunts in 1950’s America, humiliated the SLD and, in large part, compromised the entire post-1989 period.
They reflect the instincts of Polish voters. People vote for all kinds of parties, from the far right all the way to the left, so long as they are convinced that the parties will deal with their social concerns and grievances.
The fusion of an irresponsible right-wing campaign and economic stagnation made Poland’s “wandering” electorate shift in the direction of the PiS, whose success was mostly due to its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, currently the right’s most prominent politician.
Kaczynski presented this fluid electorate with a credible vision of a state concerned with social solidarity (with no one’s refrigerator standing empty) and opposed to heartless liberalism (which brings empty refrigerators for the poor and full ones for the rich).
This contrast, and a strong attack on the liberal Civic Platform, made it impossible to create a moderate right-wing coalition.
Having rejected Civic Platform as a partner, Kaczynski decided to ally his minority PiS with the populist Self-Defense party and the nationalist LPR.
The stated goal of the new alliance was to establish what Kaczynski calls the “Fourth Republic” (implying a constitutional break with the supposedly compromised post-1989 Third Republic).
The Kaczynskis want to destroy the “corrupt system composed of careerist politicians, post-communists, former secret service functionaries, and criminal organizations,” who, according to the twins, have ruled Poland since 1989.
The Fourth Republic is supposed to be republican, rather than liberal, with greater state involvement in the economy.
It is to be a democracy steered from above, with only a limited division of power and a streak of authoritarianism, guided by a mixture conservatism, populism, and nationalism.
It is to be assertive in its dealings with the EU – perhaps not so much Euro-skeptical as “Euro-difficult” – aping Margaret Thatcher’s Britain of the 1980’s, despite Poland’s being much poorer and less politically influential than Thatcher’s Britain was.
The notion of a Fourth Republic incites heated opposition.
President Lech Kaczynski’s approval ratings, are dramatically lower than those of his predecessor, the SLD’s Aleksander Kwasniewski.
His brother, Jaroslaw, has always evoked popular mistrust.
Most Poles did not vote for the Kaczynskis and still do not want to follow them.
But they did not see the risk in letting them gain so much power, and so did not mobilize to block them.
New elections are not due until 2009.
To be sure, a political crisis can bring the coalition down, but this can happen only if Poland’s “wandering” electorate decides that the PiS has let it down.
That looks unlikely.
The coalition took power at the start of what seems to be a new period of prosperity, underpinned by large EU subsidies.
As a result, there will be room for myriad favors for special interests and for boosting social benefits, which may buy time for the PiS and its vision of a Fourth Republic.
How far will the twins push their idea?
Jaroslaw Kaczynski is an intelligent politician who understands the link between currency stability and political success.
So he will not allow government largesse to become excessive and thus risk a negative reaction in the financial markets.
Yet the strong link between the fate of the coalition (and that of the Fourth Republic) and a fickle electorate addicted to social benefits will block the serious reforms that are needed to put the economy on a sound footing in the long term.
This will likely result in a gradual loss of economic competitiveness ­– all the more dangerous for being obscured by the temporary boost from EU funds, which will help maintain the government’s popular support.
In that case, life with the twins could become more interesting than Poland needs.

A New World of Health Care
NEW YORK – Traditional health-care systems are in trouble.
In the OECD, costly hospitals and clinics dominate health services, and account for 97% of the United States’ health-care spending.
These systems are struggling in the face of cost constraints, public demand for higher quality, and exaggerated expectations.
But there is a different system, widely practiced in poorer countries that cannot afford Western-style hospitals, and centered on community-based healthcare.
We need both approaches; and we need them to work together.
Indeed, the growing gap between the promise and the reality of health care has created room – in developed and developing countries alike – for new players who are concerned more with social behavior than with biology.
In his seminal 1996 article in the Harvard Business Review, W. Brian Arthur identified the important distinctions between a health-care system defined by planning, hierarchy, and control and one characterized by observation, positioning, and flattened organizations.
The first type of system, he argued, is concerned with materials, processing, and optimization.
It is principally focused on access to medical care, and typically faces diminishing returns.
By contrast, the second type of system is a networked world of psychology, cognition, and adaption.
It can increase returns through its agile structure and ability to meet varied, locally determined, needs.
It is not driven by the interests of any specific industry, and it complements, rather than competes with, high-cost health-care systems.
It prioritizes wellbeing, healthy behavior, and how health choices are made.
The latter approach is particularly relevant to conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes, which most closely reflect individual behavior, physical context, and socioeconomic factors.
Consider diabetes.
A few major pharmaceutical companies compete for a finite group of diabetics by offering new formulations, marginal improvements in blood-sugar control, competitive pricing, and strategic partnerships with insurers and health-care providers.
These incumbents are primarily concerned with defending their market position.
Their activities do not extend to helping the hundreds of millions of obese people at risk of diabetes, or to those who respond poorly to existing treatment.
But the key to living well with diabetes is a nutritious diet, an active lifestyle, social support, and coaching that is tailored to each individual’s circumstances.
This basic formula also forms the foundation of efforts to prevent diabetes, as well as most chronic diseases.
And it benefits healthy people, too.
Indeed, traditional medical care accounts for only a small share (perhaps 20%) of our quality of life and life expectancy, while the rest is determined by healthy behavior, social and economic factors, and the physical environment.
Dealing with the global epidemic of chronic diseases requires us to address this 80%, and doing so cannot be left to traditional health-care organizations alone.
Instead, many successful initiatives, built upon existing social infrastructure, solve known health problems and even uncover new issues.
Examples of this new approach include technology companies such as Omada Health, which delivers customized online health coaching at home for people at risk of diabetes; social enterprises, such as the Grameen Bank, which is building low-cost primary care systems on the back of its microlending networks; and the One Million Community Health Worker Campaign, which teaches ordinary citizens how to provide care in their own communities, based on lessons learned from similar models in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Such health-care initiatives can be accelerated in practical ways.
For starters, national health-care spending across the OECD must shift from its almost exclusive focus on medical care and embrace new entrants that can deliver health improvements.
Moreover, these new entrants should have access to the costly data and financial infrastructure of traditional health-care systems.
Physicians and nurses should be encouraged to work with new health practitioners to engage external stakeholders, such as schools, food companies, financial firms, and social services.
Finally, greater support is needed for community groups and family caregivers who help people striving for better health.
Western health-care authorities are taking note.
Britain’s National Health Service in Wales, for example, is experimenting with community practices similar to those used in Brazil.
New York City, inspired by African health networks, is expanding its community health networks to connect the city’s disjointed services.
To be sure, the promise of traditional health care will always be compelling as long as technological progress continues to enhance health infrastructure and service delivery.
Even so, there is much to learn from a new generation of health experts who understand how individuals make decisions, how collective action creates a healthier environment, and how good health is a means to a better life.
Ultimately, the new world of health care has unlimited potential, because its frontier is where we live, work, and play, making all of us health-care experts and innovators.
Ultimately, the battle against chronic disease will be won or lost at home.

The EU's Next Priority After Enlargement?
Le défi Americain
The European Union summit that just ended in Copenhagen has more or less settled the EU's future frontiers.
Ten new members, from Central Europe and the Mediterranean, will be admitted in 2004.
Two other countries, Bulgaria and Romania, can aim for membership three years after that.
Turkey, after much huffing and puffing, has had its status as an officially recognized candidate for membership reaffirmed, even if mighty doubts remain as to when it will actually join.
Because this enlargement round is likely to be the last for a long time, if not forever, it is urgent for member states to think seriously about re-writing the EU treaties to deal with the new reality, in terms which will be workable for the long term.
In particular, member states will need to think much more radically about developing a strong EU foreign and security policy, for two reasons.
First, enlargement will take the EU right up to the frontier of Russia and the former Soviet Union; if Turkey joins, the EU will extend to the heart of the Middle East as well.
Second, the international context in which the EU operates is being transformed by the strategic revolution underway in Washington.
For the past 50 years, the EU was largely able to count on a benign partnership with the US in a multilateral context; that assumption no longer holds, even if we do not yet know the extent of America's new unilateralism.
The problem is aggravated by the fact that the EU remains wholly unprepared for its "big bang" enlargement, even as it is set to begin.
No one has any idea how to run a Union of 25 or more member states--not even in terms of basic logistics, starting with the geometric escalation in translation requirements.
Or consider the laboriousness of conducting negotiations in a room with 25 national delegations, 10 of whom will be unfamiliar with the way the EU works.
But the enlargement schedule agreed at Copenhagen will define the final limit of the Union.
Norway may one day possibly seek to join, and that would pose no problems; it is conceivable that Switzerland may seek to join, and that too would not be a problem (except to the Swiss).
Otherwise, it is difficult to imagine further EU enlargement.
Aside from the poor, war-ravaged Balkan states--Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, and whatever Serbia and Montenegro end up deciding to call themselves--the only imaginable additional candidates, assuming that they are classified as "European," are Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.
The key country here is Russia.
Leaving aside all questions of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, Russia is just too big, too Asiatic, too nuclear, and too much of a "great power," to be accommodated inside the EU.
In theory, the advantage of this "big bang" enlargement is that it may concentrate minds on the need for a radical re-think of the decision-making processes in a bigger EU.
Past enlargements have been in packets of one, two, or at most three new members.
On these occasions existing members pretended that they need not fundamentally change the EU's institutional arrangements.
With 10 new members joining, that pretence is no longer tenable.
Fortunately, the ground is being prepared for reform by the Convention on the future of the Union being chaired by former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, which should make its institutional proposals next spring.
The trouble is that the steep escalation of enlargement coincides with a swing of opinion in a number of member countries in favor of a more intergovernmental EU, with more emphasis on cooperation between sovereign states and less attention to strengthening common EU institutions.
This is most notable among big member states like Britain, France, and Spain, and one can see why; these are former "great powers," which fear being submerged in a mega-Europe.
They hope to perpetuate their influence by asserting claims of national sovereignty.
But this is the wrong solution to the problem of a bigger EU.
Decision-making is already difficult in an EU with 15 members.
It will become impossible in an EU of 25-30, unless the scope for majority voting is enlarged, and the veto power of individual states reduced.
In short, a large EU will have to have much more the character of a federation than a small EU.
This is not a question of ideology; it is a question of arithmetic.
An analogous argument applies to the development of a more effective EU foreign policy.
Russia is no longer perceived as a military threat.
But if the US continues to downgrade its commitment to multilateralism, and instead determines to intervene militarily wherever it pleases, then the world will become a much more dangerous place.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair says that Europe should be a partner, not a servant or a rival, of the US.
That would certainly be progress on the European side compared with what we have now, and would require much closer foreign policy cooperation within Europe than Britain, France, or Germany seem prepared to consider.
But it takes two to tango.
Unless there is a fundamental change in the posture of the Bush administration, it seems doubtful that partnership will be on offer at all.
In short, if we are living in a world in which the US acts solely in its own immediate national interests, the EU will be compelled to do likewise.
No EU government, however, yet seems prepared to face this.

What is the Deficit Endgame?
REYKJAVIK – No one yet has any real idea about when the global financial crisis will end, but one thing is certain: government budget deficits are headed into the stratosphere.
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt.
Although governments may try to cram public debt down the throats of local savers (by using, for example, their rising influence over banks to force them to hold a disproportionate quantity of government paper), they will eventually find themselves having to pay much higher interest rates as well.
Within a couple years, interest rates on long-term US Treasury notes could easily rise 3-4%, with interest rates on other governments’ paper rising as much, or more.
Interest rates will rise to compensate investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolio and for an increasing risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away the value of their debts, or even default.
In research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises, we find that public debt typically doubles, even adjusting for inflation, in the three years following a crisis.
Many nations, large and small, are now well on the way to meeting this projection.
China’s government has clearly indicated that it will use any means necessary to backstop growth in the face of a free fall in exports.
The Chinese have $2 trillion in hard currency reserves to back up their promise.
President Barack Obama’s new budget calls for a stunning $1.75 trillion deficit in the United States, a multiple of the previous record.
Even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal orgy are seeing their surpluses collapse and their deficits soar, mainly in the face of falling tax revenues.
Indeed, few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections, typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios.
Unfortunately, in 2009, the global economy will not be a bed of roses.
Income in the US and euro-area both appear to have declined at an annualized rate of roughly 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008; Japan’s GDP fell at perhaps twice that rate.
China’s claim that its GDP grew at a 6% rate, during the end of last year, is suspect.
Exports have collapsed throughout Asia, including Korea, Japan, and Singapore. Arguably India, and to a lesser extent Brazil, have been holding out a bit better.
But few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can withstand a sustained collapse in the developed economies, much less serve as substitute engines of global growth.
With the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small and medium-size businesses to obtain even the minimal level of financing necessary to maintain inventories and conduct trade, global GDP is on a precipice in 2009.
There is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contraction since World War II.
In all likelihood, a slew of countries will see output declines of 4-5% in 2009, with some. having true depression level drops, of 10% or more.
Worse yet, unless financial systems spring back, growth could disappoint for years to come, especially in “ground zero” countries such as the United States, Britain, Ireland and Spain. US long-term growth could be particularly dismal, as the Obama administration steers the country toward more European levels of welfare assistance and income redistribution,
Countries with European-style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60% of GDP when interest rates were low.
But, with debts in many countries rising to 80% or 90% of GDP, and with today’s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon, trouble is brewing.
Many of the countries that are piling on massive quantities of debt to bail out their banks have only tepid medium term growth prospects, raising real questions of solvency and sustainability
Italy, for example with a debt-to-income ratio already exceeding 100%, has been able to manage so far thanks to falling global rates.
But as debts mount, and global interest rates rise, investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt restructuring.
Other countries, such as Ireland, Britain, and the US, started with a much stronger fiscal position, but may not be much better off when the smoke clears.
Exchange rates are another wild card.
Asian central banks are still nervously clinging to the dollar. But with the US printing debt and money like it is going out of style, it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road, if the euro is still around, that is.
As debt mounts and the recession lingers, we are surely going to see a number of governments trying to lighten their load through financial repression, higher inflation, partial default, or a combinations of all three.
Unfortunately, the endgame to the great recession of the 2000’s will not be a pretty picture.

A Declaration of Independence from the US
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism, especially with the military response to terrorism. American foreign policy reflects that obsession.
This year, the US will spend around $450 billion for the military, including the costs of the Iraq War, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, global environmental degradation, and global diseases.
In other words, US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity, global public health, and a sustainable environment.
Throughout 2003, the world lived with Bush's obsession.
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, and took up almost the entire UN agenda.
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed.
At the same time, Bush's emphasis on a one-dimensional, militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to increased terrorism in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia.
The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy.
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues, and emphasizing the military response to it, will not bring prosperity and peace, or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks.
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria.
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatments (anti-malarial medicines) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa's malaria in a year.
As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive, failing approach of America's government.
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, vulnerability to disease, and climate change.
Ironically, President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word.
He declared in London recently that "the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required."
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges.
For example, at the International Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, America signed the Monterrey Consensus, which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7% of national income.
That would bring an additional $60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year. Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled.
The US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992.
It has so far failed to act.
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
Yet at Cancun, Mexico earlier this summer, it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies.
The list goes on and on.
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty, yet it has taken few steps in that direction.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America committed itself to protect global ecosystems, yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then.
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN.
But because the US is the richest, most powerful country in the world, its neglect is devastating.
If the US really wants to undercut terrorism, it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere.
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses.
The US represents just 5% of the world's population, and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly.
Poor countries, especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, the Philippines--should say, "We need to act on the issues that concern us, not just on the issues that concern the US."
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness.

Inequality Disaster Prevention
NEW HAVEN – Thomas Piketty’s impressive and much-discussed book Capital in the Twenty-First Century has brought considerable attention to the problem of rising economic inequality.
But it is not strong on solutions.
As Piketty admits, his proposal – a progressive global tax on capital (or wealth) – “would require a very high and no doubt unrealistic level of international cooperation.”
We should not be focusing on quick solutions.
The really important concern for policymakers everywhere is to prevent disasters – that is, the outlier events that matter the most.
And, because inequality tends to change slowly, any disaster probably lies decades in the future.
That disaster – a return to levels of inequality not seen since the late nineteenth to early twentieth century – is amply described in Piketty’s book.
In this scenario, a tiny minority becomes super-rich – not, for the most part, because they are smarter or work harder than everyone else, but because fundamental economic forces capriciously redistribute incomes.
In The New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century, I proposed “inequality insurance” as a way to avert disaster.
Despite the similarity of their titles, my book is very different from Piketty’s.
Mine openly advocates innovative scientific finance and insurance, both private and public, to reduce inequality, by quantitatively managing all of the risks that contribute to it.
And I am more optimistic about my plan to prevent disastrous inequality than Piketty is about his.
Inequality insurance would require governments to establish very long-term plans to make income-tax rates automatically higher for high-income people in the future if inequality worsens significantly, with no change in taxes otherwise.
I called it inequality insurance because, like any insurance policy, it addresses risks beforehand.
Just as one must buy fire insurance before, not after, one’s house burns down, we have to deal with the risk of inequality before it becomes much worse and creates a powerful new class of entitled rich people who use their power to consolidate their gains.
In 2006, I co-authored a draft paper with Leonard Burman and Jeffrey Rohaly of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center that analyzed variations on such a plan.
In 2011, Ian Ayres and Aaron Edlin proposed a similar idea.
Underlying such plans is the assumption that some substantial degree of inequality is economically healthy. The prospect of becoming rich clearly drives many people to work hard.
But massive inequality is intolerable.
Of course, there is no guarantee that an inequality-insurance plan will actually be carried out by governments. But they are more likely to follow such plans if they are already legislated and take effect gradually, according to a formula known in advance, rather than suddenly in some revolutionary departure from past practice.
To be truly effective, increases in wealth taxes – which fall more on highly mobile retired or other affluent people – would have to include a global component; otherwise, the rich would simply emigrate to whichever country has the lowest tax rates.
And the unpopularity of wealth taxes has impeded global cooperation.
Finland had a wealth tax but dropped it. So did Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and Spain.
Increasing wealth taxes now, as Piketty proposes, would strike many people as unfair, because it would amount to imposing a retroactive levy on the work carried out to accumulate that wealth in the past – a change to the rules of the game, and its outcome, after the game is over.
Older people who worked hard to accumulate wealth over the course of their lifetime would be taxed on their frugality to benefit people who didn’t even try to save.
If they had been told that the tax was coming, maybe they would not have saved so much; maybe they would have paid the income tax and consumed the rest, like everybody else.
Moreover, once the reality of a Piketty-type wealth tax was understood, the rich might procreate more, because wealth in the form of children cannot be taxed away – which is why it would probably be better to tax income and maintain a deduction for philanthropic contributions outside of the family.
And, if there are to be wealth taxes, instituting them now to take effect only in the future – and only if inequality becomes much worse – would preempt the perception that the rules had been changed after the game had ended.
The advantage of income-tax increases is that they could be based not just on current income, but on some average of income over the course of years, and could allow deductions for investments, thus sharing some features with wealth taxes without penalizing those who saved more to accumulate more wealth.
Moreover, a long-term plan legislated by one or a few countries today, before any substantial impact on actual tax payments occurs, could help to promote an international dialogue about appropriate future policy toward inequality. That would create room for a more uniform tax response among countries, thus reducing the ability of the super-rich to evade taxation by switching location.
Piketty’s book makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary inequality.
He has identified a serious risk to our society.
Policymakers have a responsibility to implement a workable way to insure against it.

Killer Corruption
WASHINGTON, DC – COVID-19 is a ticking time bomb in Africa.
Some of the risks are widely documented.
Health-care systems are weak and overburdened, with ten African countries reportedly having no ventilators at all.
Food supplies are unstable, and have already suffered major disruptions.
And over 18 million people are refugees or internally displaced, leaving them especially vulnerable.
But another major obstacle to effective COVID-19 responses is being largely overlooked: widespread corruption.
The international community is stepping up to help Africa fight the pandemic.
The International Monetary Fund has suspended 25 (mostly African) countries’ debt payments for the next six months.
The World Bank Group is making available a package of up to $12 billion in immediate support to assist developing countries in coping with the outbreak.
Billions of aid dollars will be allocated to Africa.
Yet, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, up to 25% of global procurement funding is lost to corruption.
Such losses are prevalent in many African countries, where senior government officials and their international collaborators have used public policy and resources to enrich themselves.
Donated medicines intended for the poor have been stolen and resold for profit.
Government procurement contracts have been manipulated and misused.
Foreign-aid disbursements have been diverted to private accounts.
In late March, a former health minister in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was sentenced to five years of forced labor for embezzling more than $400,000 from the DRC’s funds earmarked for responding to Ebola.
Most corrupt officials and business leaders, however, never see the inside of a prison cell.
For them, stealing money meant for vulnerable populations is business as usual, and, given their powerful connections, punishment is often the furthest thing from their minds.
This may be all the more true during the COVID-19 crisis, because movement restrictions and office closures have hamstrung the anti-corruption work of oversight bodies, activists, and the press.
If action is not taken soon, many African countries may face sharply higher death rates, not only from COVID-19, but also from inadequate economic support and social protections.
Avoiding this outcome hinges on the credible threat of punishment for anyone caught stealing funds or otherwise disrupting COVID-19 response efforts for their own gain.
Fortunately, mechanisms for doling out such punishments already exist: an array of tried-and-true financial policies by governments, multilateral institutions, and banks around the world.
In the United States, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act gives the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the authority to impose sanctions on anyone who engages in public-sector corruption.
Stealing, diverting, or obstructing resources meant for the COVID-19 response would fall neatly into this category.
OFAC has a truly global reach: given the US dollar’s global primacy, the vast majority of international financial transactions touch the US financial system.
As a result, OFAC can effectively cut off entities from the international financial system.
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network – the Treasury Department bureau tasked with combating domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes – also has a key role to play.
FinCEN advisories give banks guidance on filing suspicious-activity reports, which financial intelligence units can use to pursue corruption investigations.
During the COVID-19 crisis, FinCEN can issue an anti-money-laundering advisory, warning banks worldwide to strengthen due diligence on suspicious financial transactions related to emergency public-health responses.
Likewise, banks operating in Africa can independently enhance their risk-assessment frameworks and transaction screening, in order to detect suspicious activity in pandemic-related funding streams.
Since banks already screen for financial crimes, they would merely have to broaden their focus to suspicious activities involving senior government officials, companies in public-health procurement, and the broader health sector.
The Egmont Group of global financial intelligence units, of which FinCEN is a member, can collaborate to investigate diversions of public-health funding by corrupt actors.
Although siphoned money usually crosses borders, the Egmont Group’s information-sharing agreements help to overcome this hurdle, facilitating international investigations.
Meanwhile, governments and financial institutions should do more to support the African civil-society groups, responsible businesses, and concerned officials who raise red flags and blow whistles on corruption.
The evidence that these actors collect will facilitate legal action against networks of corrupt officials and businesspeople.
These solutions are not just theoretical; they have been used in South Sudan and the DRC, with encouraging results.
The Israeli diamond dealer Dan Gertler made millions looting the DRC’s natural resources thanks to deals with corrupt officials, and laundered the money through the international banking system.
But – armed with investigative dossiers by The Sentry (of which I am a co-founder with George Clooney), reports by Global Witness, and the work of investigative journalists – the US imposed sanctions on Gertler and his global network.
In South Sudan, anti-money laundering advisories from the US and UK governments have made moving the proceeds of corruption through the international financial system much more difficult.
In fact, sanctions placed on key government officials and their commercial facilitators in the country – combined with those anti-money-laundering measures – have helped to push warring parties toward peace.
During a pandemic, there is a temptation to focus solely on protecting public health and fostering economic recovery.
But failure to continue – and even intensify – the fight against corruption could severely undermine those efforts.
Only by implementing credible consequences for corrupt-related disruption of COVID-19 responses can we ensure that government officials and business elites respond to the urgent needs of people, rather than profiting from their misery.

The Inflation Catch-Up Game
CAMBRIDGE – Inflation is now on the front page of newspapers around the world, and for good reason.
Prices of more and more goods and services are increasing in a manner not seen for decades.
This inflationary spike, accompanied by actual and feared supply shortages, is fueling both consumer and producer anxiety.
By also threatening to worsen inequality and derail a much-needed sustained and inclusive economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also becoming a hot political issue.
For their part, policymakers at central banks in the United Kingdom and the United States have started to move away from the narrative of “transitory” inflation.
(The cognitive transition at the European Central Bank is less pronounced, which makes sense, given that the inflation dynamics there are less pronounced.)
But the pivot is far from complete and not nearly quick enough, particularly at the US Federal Reserve, the world’s most powerful and systemically important monetary institution.
Delays in Congress approving measures to increase productivity and enhance labor-force participation are not helping, either.
The reasons for the rise in inflation are well known.
Buoyant demand is encountering inadequate supply – a result of disrupted transportation and supply chains, labor shortages, and an energy squeeze.
While notable, this price surge does not herald a return to a 1970s scenario of double-digit inflation rates.
Rigid cost-price indexing is rarer these days.
Initial conditions regarding the formation of inflationary expectations are a lot less unstable.
And central banks’ credibility is much higher, although it is currently facing its severest test in decades.
But inflation will nonetheless be much more pronounced than top Fed officials had thought when they repeatedly dismissed increasing price pressures as a temporary phenomenon.
Even today, their inflation forecasts – despite having been revised up several times already – still underestimate what lies ahead.
Survey-based inflation expectations compiled by the New York Federal Reserve have risen above 4% on both a one- and three-year time horizon.
Knock-on cost-push inflation tendencies are broadening.
Quit rates among US workers are at record highs as employees feel more comfortable leaving their jobs to seek better-paying positions or strike a better work-life balance.
There is more talk of labor strikes.
And all of this is exacerbated by consumers and firms bringing forward future demand, mainly in response to concerns about product shortages and rising prices.
The current bout of inflation is part of a general structural change in the global macroeconomic paradigm.
We have gone from a situation of deficient aggregate demand to one in which demand is fine overall.
Notably, US retail sales increased by a higher-than-expected 13.9% year on year in September, indicating that there are still quite a few pockets of pent-up purchasing power being translated into effective demand.
Of course, this is not to say that there are no issues regarding the composition of demand that must be addressed.
Inequality, not just of income and wealth but also of opportunity, remains an urgent concern.
Higher and more persistent inflation underscores such concerns, because its implications are multifaceted – economic, financial, institutional, political, and social.
Those effects will prove increasingly uneven in their impact, hitting the poor especially hard.
Globally, the fallout from the inflationary surge risks knocking some lower-income developing countries off a secular path of economic convergence.
All this makes it even more important for the Fed and Congress to act promptly to ensure that the current inflationary phase does not end up unnecessarily undermining economic growth, increasing inequality, and fueling financial instability.
A marked reduction in monetary stimulus, still operating in hyper-emergency mode, is needed, notwithstanding the unlucky timing that governs the shift to the Fed’s new policy framework.
And US lawmakers can assist by moving more forcefully on supply-enhancing initiatives, for both capital and labor, that fall squarely in their domain.
That means passing measures to modernize infrastructure, boost productivity, and increase labor-force participation.
Policymakers should also strengthen prudential regulation and supervision of the financial sector, especially the non-bank system.
And, given the greater pressures on corporate profit margins and the superior ability of large firms to navigate supply disruptions, they will need to keep a close eye on firm concentration.
It is good news that, after initially and persistently misreading US inflation dynamics, more Fed officials are now starting to come to grips with the situation.
The Fed would be well advised to catch up even faster.
Otherwise, it will end up in the midst of a blame game that will further erode policy credibility and undermine its political standing.

No Pain, No Gain for Britain?
LONDON – The economic historian Niall Ferguson reminds me of the late Oxford historian A.J.P. Taylor.
Though Taylor maintained that he tried to tell the truth in his historical writing, he was quite ready to spin the facts for a good cause.
Ferguson, too, is a wonderful historian – but equally ready to spin when he shifts into political gear.
Ferguson’s cause is American neo-conservatism, coupled with a relentless aversion to Keynes and Keynesians.
His latest defense of fiscal austerity came immediately after the United Kingdom’s recent election, when he wrote in the Financial Times that, “Labour should blame Keynes for their defeat.”
Ferguson’s argument amounts to that of a brutal disciplinarian who claims vindication for his methods by pointing out that the victim is still alive.
In pleading on behalf of British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, he points out that the UK economy grew by 2.6% last year (the “best performing of the G-7 economies”), but ignores the damage that Osborne inflicted on the economy en route to this recovery.
There is now much agreement about this damage. The Office of Budget Responsibility, the independent agency set up by Osborne to assess the government’s macroeconomic performance, has just concluded that austerity reduced GDP growth by 2% from 2010 to 2012, bringing the cumulative cost of austerity since 2010 to 5% of GDP.
Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University estimates that the damage might be as high as 15% of GDP. In a recent poll of British economists by the Centre for Macroeconomics, two-thirds agreed that austerity had harmed the UK economy.
Moreover, Britain is not alone.
In its October 2012 World Economic Outlook, the IMF admitted that, “fiscal multipliers were underestimated across the world.”
In plain English: the forecasters underestimated the extent of spare capacity and hence the scope for fiscal expansion to raise output.
Was it an honest mistake? Or was it because the forecasters were in thrall to economic models that implied that economies were at full employment, in which case the only result of fiscal expansion would be inflation?
They now know better, and Ferguson should now know better as well.
A depressing aspect of Ferguson’s interpretation is his failure to acknowledge the impact of the Great Recession on government performance and business expectations.
Thus, he compares 2.6% growth in 2014 with the 4.3% contraction in 2009, which he describes as “the last full year of Labour government” – as though Labour policy produced the collapse in growth.
Similarly, “At no point after May 2010 did [confidence] sink back to where it had been throughout the last two years of Gordon Brown’s catastrophic premiership” – as though the Brown government’s performance caused business confidence to collapse.
The claim that “Keynes is to blame” for Labour’s election defeat is peculiarly odd.
After all, the one thing Labour’s leadership tried hardest to do in the campaign was to distance the party from any “taint” of Keynesianism.
Perhaps Ferguson meant that it was Labour’s past association with Keynes that had damned them – “their disastrous stewardship before and during the financial crisis,” as he puts it.
In fact, Labour’s most recent governments were determinedly non-Keynesian; monetary policy was geared to hitting a 2% inflation target, and fiscal policy aimed at balancing the budget over the business cycle: standard macro-economic fare before the recession struck.
The most damning charge against their stewardship is that they embraced the idea that financial markets are optimally self-regulating – a view that Keynes rejected.
Keynes was not to blame for Labour’s defeat; in large part, Scotland was. The Scottish National Party’s crushing victory left Labour with only one seat in the country.
There are no doubt many reasons for the SNP’s overwhelming triumph, but support for austerity is not one of them.
(The Conservatives did as badly as Labour.)
Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, attacked the “cozy consensus” around fiscal consolidation in Westminster.
The deficit, she rightly said, was “a symptom of economic difficulties, not just the cause of them.”
The SNP manifesto promised “at least an additional £140 billion ($220 billion) across the UK to invest in skills and infrastructure.”
So if the SNP did so well with a “Keynesian” program of fiscal expansion, is it not arguable that Labour would have done better had it mounted a more vigorous defense of its own record in office and a more aggressive attack on Osborne’s austerity policy?
This is what leaders of the Labour party like Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, are now saying.
But they seem to have had no influence on the two architects of Labour’s election strategy, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, both now removed from front-line politics.
What the Conservatives did succeed in doing, and doing brilliantly, was to persuade English people that they were only “cleaning up Labour’s mess,” and that, but for austerity, Britain would have “gone the way of Greece” – exactly Ferguson’s view.
One might conclude that all of this is history: the voters have spoken. But it would be a mistake to accept the Conservative narrative as the last word.
It is basically a tissue of propaganda, with little support in theory and destructive effects in practice.
This might not matter so much had there been a change of government.
But Osborne is back as Chancellor, promising even tougher cuts over the next five years.
And fiscal austerity is still the reigning doctrine in the eurozone, thanks to Germany.
So the damage is set to continue. In the absence of a compelling counter-narrative, we may be fated to find out just how much pain the victims can withstand.

How India Could Win Its COVID Vaccination Race
WASHINGTON, DC – As the world enters the second year of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccination has moved front and center in policymakers’ responses.
But while vaccines offer the surest way out of the crisis, countries are approaching them in different ways.
Some are racing to vaccinate their populations, while others await longer-term efficacy data before beginning.
Still other countries find themselves in a long line to receive or purchase desperately needed doses.
Many have noted the rapid rate of Israel’s vaccination drive, the ambition of the United Kingdom, which was the first country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, and the stumbles to get supplies distributed in the United States and the European Union.
But for those seeking lessons on how to protect a population through vaccination, there’s another country to watch: India.
With 1.3 billion people, and an estimated 11 million cases of COVID-19 to date, India faces a seemingly mammoth vaccination challenge.
But the government recently announced a plan to vaccinate around 300 million people by early August.
And, judging by the country’s preparations and actions so far, it may be well equipped to handle the task.
That’s because India can meet the challenges of scale with massive manufacturing capacity, a strong public-health infrastructure with experience in vaccine delivery, an army of frontline workers, and meticulous planning.
Add to that some innovative digital tracking, and the results could put the country in an enviable position by later this year.
Frontline health workers are central players in India’s vaccination rollout, and the first in line to receive the shots.
The drive to vaccinate around 30 million frontline and other health workers began on January 16, and in the first 34 days, India achieved ten million vaccinations.
The US took 31 days to vaccinate the same number after it authorized vaccines (the rate of China’s vaccine rollout is unclear).
After India’s health workers are vaccinated, frontline workers and people aged over 50 – and younger people with serious health conditions – will be next in line.
That’s a further 260 million people that the government plans to vaccinate in under seven months.
India has the capacity to manufacture all its COVID-19 vaccines domestically.
The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer, has boosted its capacity in order to manufacture one billion doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine (known locally as Covishield), while Bharat Biotech will produce the government-backed Covaxin shot.
This should be enough to vaccinate the country’s priority groups this year.
And, because the vaccines produced domestically are priced to be the cheapest in the world, India has already supplied vaccines worth $47 million to 13 countries.
India will rely heavily on its public-health infrastructure to scale up its vaccination drive.
Three thousand COVID-19 vaccination centers have been established across the country, along with 27,000 cold chain points to keep supplies cool en route to and at their destinations.
About 150,000 staff people in 700 districts have been specially trained to administer the vaccines.
India already runs the world’s largest public-health immunization programs, targeting 27 million infants and 29 million pregnant women each year.
Since a national campaign to vaccinate children against measles and rubella began four years ago, several states have achieved coverage rates of over 90%.
The COVID-19 vaccination push is certainly ambitious, but its scale is not fundamentally different.
As some countries – including the US – have found, multi-level government systems can hamper speedy vaccine rollout if there is inadequate information flow, lack of clarity on decision-making authority between the various levels, and diffuse accountability.
India proactively addressed this issue when planning the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines by establishing a well-defined governance structure between the central government, state government, district government, and local administrative blocks.
Roles and responsibilities for each level are clearly defined, allowing a nationally coordinated response.
In addition, India is using technology to streamline tracking and accountability.
In record time, the authorities have created the dedicated Co-WIN system to track procurement and distribution of vaccine supplies, and allow people to pre-register for vaccinations.
Co-WIN builds on Aadhaar, the country’s nationwide digital ID system.
On the supply side, it uses e-VIN, the national vaccine information system.
Bringing them together has been the key to making the system work, and initial glitches have been quickly fixed.
Citizens can receive a text message informing them when and where to get the vaccine, and will receive a unique QR code certificate after they’ve received the second dose.
Although the prospects look good, India must still overcome significant hurdles.
Building a comprehensive and accurate database of individuals with comorbidities, in order to prioritize them for vaccination, remains a huge challenge.
And, as in other countries, there are worrying levels of vaccine hesitancy.
India’s impressive COVID-19 immunization figures in the first weeks could have been even higher, but some medical staff have been reluctant to get the shot, especially because the locally developed Covaxin received emergency authorization before all the trial data on its efficacy had been reviewed.
The government will need good communication campaigns to persuade older people and those with medical conditions that the vaccines are safe.
India’s experience holds at least three lessons for other countries.
First, they should make the most of their strengths.
Not every country can develop or manufacture its own vaccines.
But almost all can draw upon committed frontline workers, public-health infrastructure, or prior experience confronting epidemics or holding immunization drives.
Second, prioritizing vaccine access and tracking rollout should be built into the vaccination drive from the start.
Digging deep into the data to allocate vaccines most effectively may require building upon existing data systems, or using new tools, such as the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Planner for the US, and the Vaccine Coverage Index, which highlights which geographies are likely to have problems achieving high levels of COVID-19 vaccine coverage and why.
Finally, vaccine hesitancy will require a tailored response in each country.
Policymakers and public-health experts must devise effective strategies to reassure people that vaccination is safe – and the only road out of the pandemic and toward recovery.

From Copenhagen to Copenhagen
This week the EU's 15 Heads of state and government from the current Member States and the leaders of the 13 candidate countries meet in Copenhagen.
We meet with a clear task--to decide on enlargement of the EU.
We will finish a process that began almost ten years ago at another Summit in Copenhagen.
In 1993, the EU took the first step towards integrating the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU.
Now we are ready to conclude negotiations with the first new Member States.
From "Copenhagen to Copenhagen" has thus been the motto of the Danish EU Presidency.
It is the expression of a contribution to a vision of a unique project and process, and of Denmark's ambition to accomplish a task that has been placed in our hands.
EU enlargement is the greatest political task of our generation.
It is a challenge and an opportunity reaching beyond the present day.
It marks the end of the tragedy of the division of Europe that marred the 20th century, and provides a gateway to a common future for our peoples, in freedom, peace and prosperity.
The 20th century was a tragedy for Europe.
Before the First World War, our Continent was characterized by optimism, self-confidence and faith in the future.
These values were lost in the Great War, and we never really recovered the optimism and faith in the future that preceded it.
Two horrible world wars tore our Continent apart.
The mayhem of the Second World War was followed by more than 40 years of Communist dictatorship in Central and Eastern Europe.
For nearly half a century, we lived with an unnatural division of Europe.
Now, at long last, we can close one of the darkest and most bloodstained chapters in Europe's history.
EU enlargement marks the beginning of a new era.
It can give Europe both the dynamism and the drive to create the foundation of a new European consciousness.
It is the key to the future of Europe.
In the Convention on the future of the EU, member states and candidate countries are already discussing how to organize the EU in the years ahead.
It is important that we secure efficient institutions and decision procedures.
This is necessary in order to develop our internal market and economies, create new jobs, promote sustainable growth, and strengthen our competitiveness.
It is a prerequisite for the EU to be able to play a strong and positive role internationally, promoting peace, sustainable development, free trade, and good governance.
Together we shall build this common future, and to move toward this goal, the discussions in Copenhagen will focus on three questions.
First, we will complete negotiations with up to ten countries: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.
This is a realistic ambition.
But all involved--both candidate countries and current member states--must show the necessary flexibility in the final round of negotiations.
The second question is how to continue the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania.
These two countries are not yet ready for membership.
At the Summit in Brussels in October, we decided to support these two countries in their efforts to achieve EU membership in 2007.
In Copenhagen we will make concrete decisions on how we may strengthen their preparations for membership.
The Commission has presented a very reasonable proposal for how this can be done.
I expect that we can find reach agreement on this basis.
The third question relates to Turkey, with which accession negotiations have not yet begun.
The expectations of the new Turkish government--and of the Turkish people--are high.
At the same time, however, it is the assessment of the Commission that Turkey is still not yet ready to initiate accession negotiations.
It must first fulfill the clear political criteria defined by the EU in Copenhagen ten years ago.
In Copenhagen this time around, we will make decisions on the next stage of Turkey's candidacy.
We must find a balanced answer reflecting both the present situation and the potential for development in Turkey.
As a candidate country, Turkey will, of course, be treated like all other candidate countries, and it will be important to send a clear signal to the Turkish people confirming their belief in the perspective of membership and a future based on Western and European values.
Europe's leaders meet in Copenhagen this week to unite our continent in peaceful cooperation.
What generations of Europeans have dreamt of is at long last within reach.
Leaders from both member states and candidate countries face a historic decision.
After ten years of preparation the time has come to make the final crucial decisions on enlargement.

The Death of Trust
BANGKOK – A friend recently asked a seemingly naïve question: “What is money?
How do I know I can trust that it is worth what it says it is worth?”
We learn in introductory economics that money is a medium of exchange.
But why do we accept that?
Banknotes are just pieces of paper with a number attached to them.
We believe in banknotes because we collectively decide to trust the government when it says that 100 is 100, not 10 or 50.
Money, therefore, is about trust, without which no society can function.
Just as we obey our leaders’ orders to fight and die because we trust their judgment, we entrust our careers and our money to those who run Citigroup and Goldman Sachs and other such banks, because we believe their leaders will be fair to their employees and clients, and honorable in their business practices.
We do not grow up wishing to work for crooks and liars.
Once that trust breaks, bad things happen.
Money ceases to have credibility.
Leaders become figures of contempt or worse.
As I write, inflation in Zimbabwe has reached an unimaginable (if not unpronounceable) level of more than 500 quintillion per cent.
One quintillion is one million trillion.
A year ago, inflation was “only” 100,000%.
This is what happens when trust vanishes.
Fortunately, Zimbabwe is not a country of real consequence for world stability.
But the Weimar Republic and China in the 1940’s were.
One opted for Hitler and the other for Mao Zedong to restore trust.
So the risks are clear.
Are we now seeing an erosion of trust in America and in the United Kingdom?
The first warning sign surfaced in 2001, with the bankruptcy of Enron in the United States.
Its fraudulent accounts were certified by Arthur Andersen.
Now, India’s Satyam, audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, is found to be missing billions in cash.
If we cannot rely on the best auditors, can we continue to trust chartered accountants?
Bond rating agencies have issued misleading ratings on companies in questionable health.
Will we ever again be able to trust a triple A rating issued by, say, Moody’s?
Banks have been holding our money for safekeeping since the fourteenth century, when the Florentines invented the practice.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, founded in 1727, when laissez-faire philosopher Adam Smith was only four years old, has just become a socialist state-owned-enterprise thanks to the bank’s incompetent leaders, who acquired over-priced banks filled with toxic assets.
Citicorp, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and other symbols of “excellence” all would have collapsed but for public bailouts.
And yet for decades we thought that the people who were managing those firms were much smarter than we were.
We grew up admiring leaders such as Robert Rubin, John Thain, and Henry Paulson.
Rubin, a former US Treasury Secretary and ex-Chairman of Goldman Sachs, presided over the collapse of Citigroup while taking home $150 million in bonuses.
Should he really have been rewarded at all for his “performance”?
Just this week, the technically bankrupt Citigroup’s senior executives were about to buy a new $50 million luxury French jet for themselves, until the White House stopped it.
Thain, also a former president of Goldman Sachs, helped himself and his Merrill Lynch staff to $4 billion in bonus payments even after he had to sell the firm to Bank of America to save it from bankruptcy.
After he was caught spending $1.2 million, even as Merrill Lynch disintegrated, to decorate his new office, Bank of America had to fire him to placate growing revulsion over Wall Street’s out-of-control culture of entitlement.
Paulson, the outgoing Treasury Secretary and another Goldman Sachs veteran, left a loophole in his rescue package big enough for a truck to drive through.
That loophole allowed his former friends and colleagues on Wall Street to pay themselves billion-dollar bonuses while keeping those firms afloat with taxpayers’ money.
The universities these men attended – Harvard and Yale for Rubin; MIT and Harvard for Thain; Dartmouth and Harvard for Paulson – have been magnets for the world’s finest young minds.
The rest of us thought that these institutions could instill the wisdom, insight, and character of which we all wished we had more.
Perhaps parents all over the world should re-examine their often obsessive craving for these “name-brand” universities, pushing their children as if an Ivy League degree was an end in itself.
Now we know that Wall Street’s titans were never all that smart, and certainly not very ethical, for they failed the only test that counts.
All of the firms they led collapsed, and were saved only by money from those who could never get a senior job on Wall Street or a place at Harvard.
These Wall Street princes were smarter in one way, however: they managed to pocket a fortune while the rest of us are stuck with the mess they left behind.
Bernard Madoff who hailed from down-market part of New York City and attended a middling university will spend time behind bars, but none of the titans of Wall Street with blue-chip pedigree will ever do so.
History has not been kind to societies that lose trust in the integrity of their leaders and institutions.
We need to save our economic system from its abusers, or else.

Seeking Sovereignty in Europe and Iraq
Two very different efforts at "nation building" are galvanizing world attention: America's struggle to construct a viable polity in Iraq and the EU's ambitious project of making Europe into a true "Union."
While many issues involved are distinct, a "democratic deficit" looms large in both undertakings.
Why and what will it take to overcome it?
Sovereign regimes require a political identity.
To understand this, lets reflect on a few considerations with a Rousseauian flavour.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the conflicted genius who first articulated many basic themes of modernity, from democracy through authenticity, with all their contradictory demands.
He is a great thinker, whose advice is always disastrous to follow.
The first modern, democratic revolutions transferred power from monarchs to the "nation" or the "people."
But this required inventing a new kind of collective agency that could decide and act together, to which one could attribute - a la Rousseau -- a "will."
This new entity requires strong cohesion, because popular sovereignty means more than simply the will of the majority.
After all, many sorts of bodies, even the loosest aggregations, can adopt majority decision-making.
Suppose that during a public lecture, some people feel hot and ask that the windows be opened; others disagree.
One might decide the matter by a show of hands, with the minority accepting the outcome favored by the majority as legitimate.
Yet the audience might be comprised of individuals unknown to one another, without mutual concern, brought together only by the lecture.
Democratic societies, by contrast, need to be bonded more powerfully than some chance grouping.
Popular sovereignty entails certain types of decision procedures--grounded ultimately on the will of the majority (restricted by respect for liberty and individual rights)--and offers a particular justification for collective decision-making.
Under a regime of popular sovereignty, we are free in a way that we are not under an absolute monarch or an entrenched aristocracy.
To see why, consider such a regime from an individual's standpoint.
Say that I am outvoted on some important issue.
I must abide by an outcome I oppose.
My will is thwarted, so why should I consider myself free?
Why does it matter that it is the majority of my fellow citizens, rather than the decisions of a monarch, that is overriding my will?
Indeed, we can even imagine that a potential monarch, waiting to return to power in a coup, agrees with me on the issue in question.
Wouldn't I be freer after a counter-revolution, when my will--at least on this matter--would then be put into effect?
This question is not merely theoretical.
It is rarely put on behalf of individuals, but it regularly arises for sub-groups, such as national minorities, who see themselves as oppressed by majorities.
Perhaps no answer can satisfy them.
Whatever one says or does, they may be unable to see themselves as part of a larger sovereign people.
They therefore see its rule over them as illegitimate, which is precisely the point: the logic of popular sovereignty requires an idea of collective agency based on a sense of individual belonging that is much stronger than in our lecture audience.
Of course, some extreme philosophical individualists believe that appealing to a greater collective is pure humbug, concocted to get voters to accept voluntary servitude.
But without deciding this philosophical issue, we can ask: what feature of our "imagined communities" persuades people to accept that they are free under a democratic regime, even when their will is overridden on important issues?
The answer that we as individuals accept is that we are free because we rule ourselves in common, rather than being ruled by some agency that need not take account of us.
Our freedom consists in having a guaranteed voice in the sovereign, in being heard and participating in making decisions.
We enjoy this freedom because of a law that enfranchises all of us, so that we enjoy this freedom together.
Our freedom is realized and defended by this law, whether or not we win or lose any particular decision.
This law also defines the community whose freedom it realizes and defends-a collective agency, a people, whose acting together by the law preserves their freedom.
Such is the answer, valid or not, that people accept in democratic societies.
Insofar as this freedom is crucial to their identity, they identify strongly with this ongoing collective agency--the "nation" or the "people"--and hence feel a bond with their co-participants in it.
Only an appeal to this kind of membership can rebut the challenge of those considering support for a monarch's or general's or provisional government's coup in the name of their freedom.
The crucial point is that regardless of who is right philosophically, it is only insofar as people accept some such appeal that the legitimacy principle underlying popular sovereignty can work to secure their consent.
If identification with the community is rejected, the government will be illegitimate in the eyes of the rejecters.
In short, there can be no democracy without a shared identity as participants in a common agency.
This notion--which boils down to citizenship --underscores the central challenge now posed by both the Iraqi and European projects.
Simply put, are Iraqis too divided, too long oppressed, to develop anything like the sense of common identity and collective agency that popular sovereignty requires?
In some ways, much less is at stake in building a new democratic community out of the already free and prosperous European countries.
But whether the "democratic deficit" on the European level be remedied also depends on whether a shared European identity can be forged out of the 25 nations that will soon make up the European Union.
Both projects are audacious.
Neither is guaranteed success.

Defying the Garden of Eden Syndrome
ACCRA – When you fly into Takoradi, Ghana’s fourth largest city and an industrial and commercial center, one of the first things you notice are the oil rigs along the coast.
It is a panorama that is increasingly characteristic of modern-day Africa.
Nearby, in the city of Elmina, one can see the scars of the past.
An eerie feeling clings to you even after you finish the tour of the dungeons of the notorious Elmina Castle, the nerve center of the former West African slave trade.
In Ghana last month, I met ministers who shared with me impressive figures on how much progress the country has made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Some traditional leaders, academics, representatives of civil-society groups, and students, on the other hand, were more worried about whether the country’s new oil wealth would benefit ordinary people.
Is oil a blessing or a curse?
Will oil and other natural resources force Ghana, ranked among the leading producers of cocoa, coffee, and oil palm, to turn its back on agriculture?
Will oil wealth create a kleptocracy on the bones of 30 years of progress in meeting standard criteria of good governance?
Ghanaians are not alone in voicing such concerns.
Their compatriots in Sierra Leone also want to know what will happen now that they, too, have won the commodities lottery: last year, the country struck oil and discovered one of the largest iron-ore deposits in the world.
It also recently signed new mining concessions for bauxite, in addition to existing concessions for diamonds, titanium, and gold.
One of the iron-ore concessions in Sierra Leone is estimated to hold 10.5 billion tons of ore.
Similar stories of mineral abundance have emerged in other African countries in recent years, including in Chad, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, and Sudan.
And, as the rest of the world grapples with austerity measures, such countries should be considering restoration strategies and ways to permanently wean themselves off foreign aid.
In the same way that Ghana was the trailblazer for ending colonial rule, it could also become sub-Saharan Africa’s next success story in economic terms.
But it must be ready to make some tough choices – and study the region’s existing success stories.
On a continent where mineral wealth too often has become a curse, Botswana, under the leadership of President Festus Gontebanye Mogae, has demonstrated how natural resources can promote sustainable development and good governance.
Mogae managed to hold down inflation and attract foreign investment in order to diversify Botswana’s economy and make it less dependent on the extraction of diamonds, while simultaneously ensuring that more of the country’s mineral wealth was processed at home.
Thanks in part to the efforts of celebrities like Bono and Bob Geldof, some African countries were absolved of their long-standing debt a few years ago.
The choices that we as Africans make today will determine whether we remain poor, evolve into Dubai-like diversified economies, or follow the successful agriculture-led industrialization model implemented in Malaysia (despite that country’s gas discoveries).
African countries could also choose the Norwegian model, which established the principles that natural wealth belongs to all citizens, including the unborn, and that all mining deals should be completely transparent to the public.
Adherence to these principles ensures that private rent-seeking and appropriation of oil profits, a major dimension of the so-called resource curse, is avoided.
At the same time, it is important to prevent mineral wealth from causing unwarranted currency appreciation – the dreaded “Dutch disease.”
This would undermine other economic sectors’ competitiveness and stifle export-oriented manufacturing growth, thereby stalling these economies’ structural transformation.
In The Africans: Triple Heritage, the Kenyan-born scholar Ali Mazrui expressed concern about what he perceived to be a Garden of Eden in decay.
Speaking of the lost decade of the 1980’s in Africa, Mazrui observed that, despite being endowed with superb climatic conditions, few African countries could feed themselves; likewise, despite being engaged in trade in minerals and cash crops, most countries still wallowed in a state of aid-dependency.
Mazrui, forever the optimist, expressed hope that the “human will has the power of restoration.”
We Africans can blame colonialism for most of the problems of the past 350 years, but we will have no one to blame for the decisions that we make in the next 50 years.
No one is forcing us to sign the mining and drilling deals today.
African leaders should use the Natural Resource Charter, launched in Oslo in 2009, and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative as guidelines when undertaking any mining negotiations.
We can and must avoid the Garden of Eden Syndrome.

Beating the Child Killers
GENEVA – Ask most people to name the two biggest causes of death among children, and they will most likely say malaria and HIV.
In fact, it is pneumonia and diarrhea – the “forgotten killers” – that are responsible for the highest death toll, claiming more than two million of the most vulnerable lives every year.
Together, these two diseases account for 29% of all deaths of children under five years old.
That is more than double the total for HIV and malaria combined, and nearly as many as all other infectious diseases, injuries, and other post-neonatal conditions put together.
Yet as shocking as these statistics are, what is perhaps even more surprising is just how preventable pneumonia and diarrhea are – so much so that it would be quite feasible to introduce measures that by 2025 would reduce their death toll to almost zero.
That is precisely what we are now aiming to do.
An ambitious new plan, called the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea, launched this month by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, aims to step up existing interventions and pool global efforts, with the goal of reducing the number of deaths from pneumonia to less than three children per 1,000, and of diarrhea-related deaths to below one in 1,000.
This would effectively end the preventable deaths of more than two million children every year.
For any other infectious disease or global health threat, achieving this kind of reduction in incidence rate and mortality would be nothing short of miraculous.
Yet, for pneumonia and diarrhea, we have every reason to believe that we can succeed, because we already know what works.
For example, infants who are not exclusively breastfed for the first six months have a ten-fold increase in the risk of death from diarrhea, and are 15 times more likely to die from pneumonia.
Similarly, basic sanitation, such as improved hand washing and access to clean water, and better nutrition can also produce significant risk reduction, much of which can be achieved through simple education programs.
Immunization is also highly effective.
Vaccinating children against rotavirus, for example, can protect them from a pathogen that is responsible for 37% of all diarrhea deaths in children under five, thus saving 450,000 lives every year.
Similarly, vaccines exist to protect against pneumococcal disease, which accounts for a half-million pneumonia-related deaths annually.
When combined, these interventions significantly reduce both pneumonia and diarrhea; the problem is that, too often, they do not reach the children most at risk, such as those living in extreme poverty or hard-to-reach communities in the world’s poorest countries.
That is why we now need the Integrated Global Action Plan.
The two diseases share so many common causes and risk factors, prevention strategies and interventions, and delivery platforms for care in clinics, communities, and schools that it makes sense to bring them together.
But, if those hard-to-reach children are to benefit, our efforts must be scaled up significantly.
Until recently, this simply would not have been possible, at least not on the immunization front.
The vaccines protecting against rotavirus and pneumococcal disease are both barely more than a decade old.
In the past, such new vaccines would take, on average, 15 years to reach developing countries – and then at prices that would place them beyond the reach of those most in need.
This is one of the reasons why my organization, the GAVI Alliance, was created: to help accelerate the introduction of new vaccines and make them more affordable and accessible in developing countries.
Through our unique public-private business model, we have worked with our partners to help increase supplies of these vaccines while simultaneously bringing down their price.
Indeed, since 2006, the price of rotavirus vaccine has fallen by 67%, to just $2.50 per dose, while the price of a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has plummeted by 90%, to $3.50.
Such price reductions have and will continue to play a crucial role in saving the lives of millions of children and achieving the Millennium Development Goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds.
To date, GAVI has helped countries immunize more than 13 million children against pneumococcal disease and five million children against rotavirus, with plans to strengthen its efforts in countries where immunization coverage is below 70%.
None of this means that we will not still face significant obstacles.
But the one thing that we know about immunization is that we can reach everyone.
We did it with smallpox, which has now been eradicated, and we are doing it with polio (with less than 100 cases worldwide this year).
The challenge now is to do the same with all of our life-saving vaccines – particularly those that target the biggest killers of children.

A New Growth Model for Europe’s Neighborhood
LONDON – More than ten years after the global financial crisis, the world economy is finally enjoying a broad-based recovery.
Europe and its broader neighborhood are no exception: economic growth in almost every country in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, as well as in Russia and Turkey, has accelerated in the last year, and is projected to remain robust.
Yet new challenges loom. If not addressed, these regions’ prospects will dim.
As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s new Transition Report shows, before the Great Recession, the countries of Europe and its broader neighborhood were outperforming comparable emerging economies elsewhere.
In recent years, however, the tables have turned – and the gap is growing.
The explanation is straightforward.
Previously, Europe and its broader neighborhood enjoyed high total factor productivity (TFP) growth.
By eliminating many of the inefficiencies inherited from their socialist or otherwise dirigiste pasts, these countries were putting their capital and labor to increasingly good use.
Yet, by 2009, the low-hanging fruit had been picked, and investment in fixed capital had fallen below the levels in emerging economies elsewhere.
Faced with the large amounts of non-performing loans inherited from the crisis, countries shifted their attention to deleveraging, leaving investment and TFP growth to stall.
Countries in Europe and its broader neighborhood – even those whose economies are less developed – cannot base long-term growth on a low-wage comparative advantage.
Instead, they must lay the foundations of future-oriented growth models, underpinned by stronger human capital and innovation.
This demands, first and foremost, deeper integration into the global economy.
Nowadays, access to larger markets is vital to generating incentives for innovation and productivity growth.
European Union countries obviously benefit from the single market.
For emerging Europe and the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), however, taking advantage of economies of scale will require reduced trade barriers and better connectivity.
In concrete terms, this means that emerging Europe and the MENA region need to invest more in infrastructure.
And, in fact, according to the Transition Report’s estimates, these regions’ infrastructure investment requirements amount to about €2.2 trillion ($2.6 trillion).
To meet this need, fiscally constrained countries will have to mobilize private resources, via private-public partnerships.
Developed-country actors often worry that infrastructure investments in emerging economies may result in “roads to nowhere,” with money being channeled toward remote regions where nobody lives or from which existing residents are eager to leave, using those shiny new roads. But this does not have to be the case.
Turkey is a case in point.
In 2002, the country launched a major effort to turn 25% of its road network into dual carriageways over the course of about ten years.
The EBRD’s Transition Report’s analysis shows that this investment has had a major impact on domestic trade and created jobs in the country’s previously underdeveloped eastern regions.
As countries attempt to attract financing for their own infrastructure projects, they should learn from – and highlight for potential donors – such successes.
Designing effective strategies for long-term infrastructure investment requires attention to another key area: the environment.
Countries must anticipate the regulatory changes that will arise, as they attempt, say, to meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
This approach is in line with the market consensus.
Using the FTSE Russell Low Carbon Economy database, the ERBD found that while greener firms remain less profitable than their less sustainable counterparts – they are, after all, largely younger and smaller – they are growing faster.
Perhaps more important, we found that firms with a higher share of green revenues have higher stock-market valuations (price-to-earnings ratios), even if their current return on equity is lower than that of their non-green peers.
This suggests that investors expect stronger growth in greener market segments, or at least attach more value to supporting greener firms.
In places where fossil fuels are adequately priced, firms themselves also recognize the benefits of greener, more energy-efficient technologies.
Unfortunately, many countries still have in place substantial energy subsidies, which must be phased out to propel the shift toward a green economy.
To ensure that the neediest households do not suffer, the removal of subsidies can be offset by targeted assistance, as has been done recently in Belarus, Egypt, and Ukraine.
A new growth model for Europe’s neighborhood must also involve a rebalancing of the financial system.
Given the Great Recession’s legacy of non-performing loans, financing for new investment is more likely to come from equity than from debt.
Fortunately, equity investors are also oriented toward the long term, and are increasingly willing to buy greener assets.
Yet greater reliance on equity finance will require better state and corporate governance, underpinned by the rule of law.
Achieving that will be no easy feat.
But EBRD research implies that, at least in the European neighborhood, progress would benefit not just the economy – including by promoting investment and innovation – but also the environment and society as a whole.
That is an investment worth making.

Oil Prices and Global Growth
CAMBRIDGE – One of the biggest economic surprises of 2015 is that the stunning drop in global oil prices did not deliver a bigger boost to global growth.
Despite the collapse in prices, from over $115 per barrel in June 2014 to $45 at the end of November 2015, most macroeconomic models suggest that the impact on global growth has been less than expected – perhaps 0.5% of global GDP.
The good news is that this welcome but modest effect on growth probably will not die out in 2016.
The bad news is that low prices will place even greater strains on the main oil-exporting countries.
The recent decline in oil prices is on par with the supply-driven drop in 1985-1986, when OPEC members (read: Saudi Arabia) decided to reverse supply cuts to regain market share.
It is also comparable to the demand-driven collapse in 2008-2009, following the global financial crisis.
To the extent that demand factors drive an oil-price drop, one would not expect a major positive impact; the oil price is more of an automatic stabilizer than an exogenous force driving the global economy.
Supply shocks, on the other hand, ought to have a significant positive impact.
Although parsing the 2014-2015 oil-price shock is not as straightforward as in the two previous episodes, the driving forces seem to be roughly evenly split between demand and supply factors.
Certainly, a slowing China that is rebalancing toward domestic consumption has put a damper on all global commodity prices, with metal indices also falling sharply in 2015.
(Gold prices, for example, at $1,050 per ounce at the end of November, are far off their peak of nearly $1,890 in September 2011, and copper prices have fallen almost as much since 2011.)
New sources of oil supply, however, have been at least as important.
Thanks to the shale-energy revolution, American oil production has risen from five million barrels per day in 2008 to 9.3 million barrels in 2015, a supply boom that has so far persisted, despite the price collapse.
Anticipation of post-sanctions Iranian oil production has also affected markets.
A decline in oil prices is to some extent a zero-sum game, with producers losing and consumers gaining.
The usual thinking is that lower prices stimulate global demand, because consumers are likely to spend most of the windfall, whereas producers typically adjust by cutting back savings.
In 2015, though, this behavioral difference has been less pronounced than usual.
One reason is that emerging-market energy importers have a much larger global economic footprint than they did in the 1980s, and their approach to oil markets is much more interventionist than in the advanced countries.
Countries such as India and China stabilize retail energy markets through government-financed subsidies to keep price down for consumers.
The costs of these subsidies had become quite massive as oil prices peaked, and many countries were already looking hard for ways to cut back.
Thus, as oil prices have fallen, emerging-market governments have taken advantage of the opportunity to reduce the fiscal subsidies.
At the same time, many oil exporters are being forced to scale back expenditure plans in the face of sharply falling revenues.
Even Saudi Arabia, despite its vast oil and financial reserves, has come under strain, owing to a rapidly rising population and higher military spending associated with conflicts in the Middle East.
The muted effect of oil prices on global growth should not have come as a complete surprise.
Academic research has been pointing in this direction for a long time.
Oil is now thought to be less of an independent driver of business cycles than was previously believed.
Also restraining growth is a sharp decline in energy-related investment.
After years of rapid growth, global investment in oil production and exploration has fallen by $150 billion dollars in 2015.
Eventually, this will feed back into prices, but only slowly and gradually: Futures markets have oil prices rising to $60 per barrel only by 2020.
The good news for 2016 is that most macroeconomic models suggest that the impact of lower oil prices on growth tends to stretch out for a couple years.
Thus, low prices should continue to support growth, even if emerging-market importers continue to use the savings to cut subsidies.
For oil producers, though, the risks are rising.
Only a couple – notably governance-challenged Venezuela – are in outright collapse; but many are teetering on the brink of recession.
Countries with floating exchange rates, including Colombia, Mexico, and Russia, have managed to adjust so far, despite facing significantly tighter fiscal constraints (though Russia’s situation remains especially vulnerable if low oil prices endure).
By contrast, countries with rigid exchange-rate regimes are being tested more severely.
Saudi Arabia’s long-standing peg to the dollar, once apparently invulnerable, has come under enormous pressure in recent weeks.
In short, oil prices were not quite as consequential for global growth in 2015 as seemed likely at the beginning of the year.
And strong reserve positions and relatively conservative macroeconomic policies have enabled most major producers to weather enormous fiscal stress so far, without falling into crisis.
But next year could be different, and not in a good way – especially for producers.

A Moral Theory’s Immoral Outcome
PRINCETON – Is it always wrong to take an innocent human life?
Many philosophical defenders of the Roman Catholic natural-law tradition argue that there are no exceptions to this prohibition, at least if we are talking about taking the life intentionally, and directly, rather than as a side effect of some other action.
(These moral theorists also define “innocent” to exclude enemy combatants, as long as the war one is fighting is just.)
When this view is combined – as it typically is in Catholic teaching – with the claim that every offspring of human parents is a living human being from the moment of conception, the implication is that abortion is never permissible.
But the case of a 22-year-old El Salvadorian woman, identified in the media only as Beatriz, makes the absoluteness of that view very difficult to defend.
Beatriz, the mother of a young son, suffers from lupus, an autoimmune disease, and other complications.
Her first pregnancy was very difficult.
Then she became pregnant again, and her doctors said that the longer the pregnancy continued, the greater the risk that it would kill her.
For most women, that alone would be sufficient grounds to terminate the pregnancy.
But Beatriz had an additional powerful reason to do so: the fetus had anencephaly, a condition in which the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain associated with consciousness, is absent.
Almost all babies with this condition die soon after birth; the few survivors are incapable of responding even to their mother’s smile.
In countries with prenatal screening and liberal abortion laws, anencephaly has become very rare, because almost all women who are told that they are carrying an anencephalic fetus choose to terminate the pregnancy.
While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws, Latin America has remained true to the faith, maintaining some of the world’s strictest legal prohibitions.
Last year, in the Dominican Republic, a 16-year-old girl with cancer was, for several weeks, refused chemotherapy because she was pregnant and the doctors worried that the potentially life-saving treatment might induce an abortion.
Although the girl was later allowed to begin treatment, both she and the fetus died.
In El Salvador, abortion is prohibited without exception.
In April, Beatriz’s doctors asked the courts to allow them to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds, but were refused.
On May 29, the Supreme Court denied Beatriz’s appeal.
To anyone concerned about human well-being – or, for that matter, human flourishing in general – such an outcome makes no sense.
Aborting an anencephalic fetus ends a life that may be human, insofar as it is the life of a member of the species Homo sapiens; but it is a life that will have zero well-being, for the infant (if it lives) will be incapable of enjoying anything.
On the other hand, not permitting Beatriz to have an abortion would risk causing the death of a young woman who desperately wanted to live, and had much to live for.
It would also risk depriving her one-year-old son of his mother.
After the Supreme Court’s decision, El Salvador’s health minister, Maria Rodriguez, announced that Beatriz would be permitted to undergo a “premature Caesarean section,” which she said was not an abortion, but an “induced birth.”
That procedure was carried out on June 3; the anencephalic newborn died five hours later.
If that was supposed to be a better outcome than an earlier termination of the pregnancy, it is hard to see for whom it was better.
It was certainly not better for Beatriz, who is still in intensive care, and for whom the long-term health impact of the pregnancy remains unclear.
And how did it benefit the anencephalic infant to have another couple of months of life in utero, and then five hours of life outside?
One point overlooked in the discussion of Beatriz’s case is that the same Catholic natural-law theory that insists that killing an innocent human being is always wrong also provides a basis for arguing that it is not wrong to kill an anencephalic fetus.
In innumerable texts, Catholic philosophers, theologians, and bioethicists argue that it is always wrong to kill innocent human beings, because, in contrast to nonhuman animals, they have a “rational nature.”
Proponents of this argument use that term to include beings that are not yet capable of rationality but will become so in the normal course of their development.
The use of the term “being with a rational nature” is very broad, perhaps too broad even when applied to normal fetuses.
To apply it to anencephalic fetuses requires a further, and much more dubious, step.
Thomas Aquinas, for instance, did not think that a rational nature is present in every member of the species Homo sapiens.
He believed that some degree of development is necessary for the human animal to become a being with a rational nature.
In the case of an anencephalic fetus, no such development is possible.
It cannot become a rational being.
For that reason, even those who believe that it is always wrong intentionally to kill an innocent being with a rational nature should not have opposed permitting Beatriz to terminate her pregnancy.
They should have embraced a humane solution that minimized the risk of a tragic ending to a story that was already sad enough.

Africa’s Hidden Hunger
DAR ES SALAAM – Just over 20 years ago, South African photographer Kevin Carter shocked the world with a controversial photograph of a famished young Sudanese child being watched by a vulture during a famine.
Critics slammed the shot as “disaster porn,” calling it yet another example of how the international media sensationalize African problems.
But what disturbs me is not the photograph.
Rather, it is that two decades later, the conditions that the photograph depicts remain basically the same.
Every year, 3.1 million children around the world still die of hunger.
As an African doctor, I know that the ravages of serious malnutrition and hunger are not always visible.
They are not always as manifest as they are in the protruding ribs of ghostly children hooked up to feeding tubes, like those I used to see in hospital wards in Tanzania.
Chronic malnutrition, or “hidden hunger,” shows itself in other ways – but it can be just as devastating and deadly.
And while deaths from many other diseases, including acute malnutrition, have declined, hidden hunger remains pervasive.
In the last two decades, astounding success has been achieved in the fight against HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.
New HIV infections have dropped by as much as 50% in some countries in Africa, with AIDS-related deaths down by 30-48%; TB cases have declined by 40%, and malaria cases by 30%.
But the stunting of early childhood growth as a result of malnutrition remains high, dropping by only about 1% over the same period.
In Africa, hunger remains the leading cause of death in children, accounting for half of all deaths of children under the age of five and killing more than AIDS, TB, and malaria combined.
In fact, many scientific studies have shown that a malnourished child is much more likely to contract an infection, to suffer from other illnesses, and to suffer from them longer.
Diarrhea, for example, is a deadly disease for severely underweight children, who are 12 times more likely to die from an ailment that should be easily treated.
And severely underweight children are 9.5 times more likely to die from malaria as well.
Indeed, childhood malnutrition is now confirmed to be the leading cause of the global disease burden, with the World Health Organization attributing to it 45% of all deaths under the age of five in 2011.
Recent reports from the war-ravaged Central African Republic indicate that more children there are dying from hunger than from bullets.
These numbers make the problem of malnutrition look insurmountable.
But what works is no secret: vitamin A, iodized salt, and fortified foods.
The lack of vitamin A alone results in blindness in a half-million children every year, with half of them dying within 12 months of losing their sight.
Similarly, half of all women of childbearing age in developing countries suffer from weakened immune systems, owing to anemia caused by iron deficiency.
The long-term damage caused by malnutrition has a domino effect, impeding educational achievement, and ultimately, hobbling national economies.
Addressing this ongoing crisis requires money – an estimated $10 billion per year – and new and better strategies to bring life-saving solutions to the mothers and children who most need them.
But the cost looks far less daunting when one considers the cost of hunger.
UNICEF estimates that the cost of Africa’s child malnutrition is $25 billion a year.
And this is not the whole story.
Malnutrition costs an estimated $3.5 trillion every year to the global economy, owing to loss of productivity and higher health-care costs.
To meet this challenge, save lives, and improve economies, Africa needs a comprehensive strategy and increased investment in agriculture.
The Africa Union has declared 2014 the year of agriculture and food security in Africa, and the continent’s agriculture sector is expected to grow significantly.
In theory, that should improve overall nutrition; but increased investment in agriculture is not a panacea.
We need to concentrate on building nutrition-sensitive agriculture programs that include small-scale farmers, households, women, and children.
A big step would be to increase women’s control over land ownership and farming decisions, along with access to agricultural credits and subsidies designed to encourage domestic food production through home gardening and cattle and poultry husbandry.
Studies show that women are much more likely than men to spend additional income on food and health.
Increasing their farming income and decision-making power ultimately has a greater impact on children’s health and nutrition.
Moreover, agricultural policies, subsidies, and investments have traditionally benefited cereal farmers.
But policymakers need to concentrate on increasing access to more nutritious foods, such as meat, fruit, and vegetables, which are too expensive for the poor.
Malnutrition causes the greatest damage during the first thousand days of life, leading to grievous and irreversible changes in infant health.
To make real inroads against hidden hunger, African governments, supported by global development partners, must act quickly.
Childhood hunger in Africa does not have to be as dramatic as that depicted in Carter’s 1993 photograph to be just as deadly.

The Road to Nuclear Disarmament
NEW YORK – Weapons of mass destruction and disarmament form one of the gravest challenges facing the world. One of my priorities as United Nations Secretary-General is to promote global public goods and remedies to challenges that do not respect borders.
A world free of nuclear weapons is a global public good of the highest order.
My interest in this subject stems partly from personal experience.
My homeland, South Korea, has suffered the ravages of conventional war and faced threats from nuclear weapons and other WMD.
But, of course, such threats are not unique to Asia.
Despite a longstanding taboo against using nuclear weapons, disarmament remains only an aspiration.
So, is a taboo merely on the use of such weapons sufficient?
States make the key decisions where nuclear weapons are concerned.
But the UN has important roles to play. We provide a central forum in which states can agree on norms to serve their common interests.
We analyze, educate, and advocate in the pursuit of agreed goals.
Most states have chosen to forgo nuclear weapons, and have complied with their commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Yet some states view such weapons as a status symbol, and some view them as offering the ultimate deterrent against nuclear attack, which largely accounts for the estimated 26,000 that still exist.
Unfortunately, the doctrine of nuclear deterrence is contagious, making non-proliferation more difficult and raising new risks that nuclear weapons will be used.
The world remains concerned about nuclear activities in North Korea and Iran, and there is widespread support for efforts to address these concerns by peaceful means.
There are also concerns that a “nuclear renaissance” is looming, with nuclear energy seen as a clean energy alternative at a time of intensifying efforts to combat climate change.
The main worry is that this will lead to the production and use of more nuclear materials that must be protected against proliferation and terrorist threats.
The obstacles to disarmament are formidable. But the costs and risks of its alternatives never get the attention they deserve.
Consider the enormous opportunity cost of huge military budgets.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditures last year exceeded $1.3 trillion.
Ten years ago, the Brookings Institution published a study that estimated the total costs of nuclear weapons in the United States alone to be over $5.8 trillion, including future cleanup costs.
By any definition, this is a huge investment that could have had many other productive uses.
Concerns over nuclear weapons’ costs and inherent dangers have led to a global outpouring of ideas to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament.
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix, the New Agenda Coalition, and Norway’s Seven Nation Initiative.
Australia and Japan have launched the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament.
Civil society groups and nuclear-weapon states have also made proposals, such as the Hoover Plan, spearheaded by Henry Kissinger.
I would like to offer my own five-point proposal.
First, I urge all NPT parties, in particular the nuclear-weapon states, to fulfill their obligation under the treaty to undertake negotiations on effective measures leading to nuclear disarmament.
They could agree on a framework of separate, mutually reinforcing instruments. Or they could consider negotiating a nuclear-weapons convention, backed by a strong verification system, as has long been proposed at the UN.
I have circulated to all UN members a draft of such a convention, which offers a good point of departure.
The nuclear powers should actively engage with other states on this issue at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum.
The world would also welcome a resumption of bilateral negotiations between the US and Russia aimed at deep and verifiable reductions of their arsenals.
Governments should also invest more in verification research and development.
The United Kingdom’s proposal to host a conference of nuclear-weapon states on verification is a concrete step in the right direction.
Second, the Security Council’s permanent members should begin discussions on security issues in the nuclear disarmament process.
They could unambiguously assure non-nuclear-weapon states that they will not be subject to the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons.
The Council could also convene a summit on nuclear disarmament.
Non-NPT states should freeze their own nuclear-weapon capabilities and make their own disarmament commitments.
Third, unilateral moratoria on nuclear tests and the production of fissile materials can go only so far.
We need new efforts to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into force, and for the Conference on Disarmament to begin negotiations on a fissile material treaty immediately, without preconditions.
I support the creation of the Central Asian and African nuclear-weapon-free zones, and strongly support efforts to establish such a zone in the Middle East.
And I urge all NPT parties to conclude their safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and voluntarily to adopt the strengthened safeguards under the Additional Protocol.
Fourth, the nuclear-weapon states often circulate descriptions of what they are doing to pursue these goals.
But these accounts seldom reach the public.
I invite the nuclear-weapon states to send such material to the UN Secretariat, and to encourage its wider dissemination.
The lack of an authoritative estimate of the total number of nuclear weapons attests to the need for greater transparency.
Finally, a number of complementary measures are needed. These include eliminating other types of WMD; new efforts against WMD terrorism; limits on the production and trade in conventional arms; and new weapons bans, including of missiles and space weapons.
If there is real, verified progress on disarmament, the ability to eliminate the nuclear threat will grow exponentially.
As we progressively eliminate the world’s deadliest weapons and their components, we will make it harder to execute WMD terrorist attacks.
These proposals offer a fresh start not only on disarmament, but also on strengthening our system of international peace and security.

Africa’s Integration Imperative
Karl Marx predicted that states would wither away in anticipation of an idyllic communist society capable of auto-regulating economic imbalances and empowering the masses.
So he would have been flabbergasted to see his prophecy realized, not by communism, but by the globalization of Anglo-American economic liberalism.
Opening up markets to the free flow of capital, not the dictatorship of the proletariat, has rendered state power obsolete.
Today’s capital markets raise money for governments, corporate clients, and individual customers, manage pension funds’ investments, and bet on the level of interest rates or the stock market.
Trading in derivatives by investment banks, hedge funds, and other market participants, reaps huge profits for traders while depriving the real economy of productive investment and job creation.
No population in the world is spared from the harsh treatment of such a system.
Some 40% of the world’s 6.5 billion people live in poverty, and a sixth live in extreme poverty.
However, the world’s black populations are the prime victims.
In the United States, one-eighth of all black males between the ages of 25 and 34 are in jail, and three out of five black American households with children are headed by a single mother.
As for African countries, the politics and economics of globalization have stripped them of their assets and natural resources and left them with an unbearable debt burden.
As a result, the percentage of Africa’s population living in extreme poverty increased from 41.6% in 1981 to 46.9% in 2001.
On the other hand, in the era of globalization, regions in which internal trade exceeds external trade have better economic outlooks and stronger social cohesion.
This is the case for Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, particularly among the member states of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay).
The opposite is true for regional groupings in Africa and in the Middle East where trade with the outside world is more important than intra-regional trade.
As a result, any country formulating strategies to counter the destructive forces of globalization should give overriding priority to a self-centred economic development strategy, preferably within a regional framework.
This is a prerequisite to defending against market fundamentalism and avoiding the iniquitous conditions of the international marketplace.
In this respect, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) constitutes an edifying example.
The ASEAN economies adopted a united front on international economic issues and accorded priority to internal economic integration and expanding linkages with major trading partners.
Exports have remained the main driver of economic performance for the ASEAN countries, contributing to 5.8% regional GDP growth in 2006.
ASEAN foreign direct investment (FDI) flows reached US$38 billion in 2005, up by 48% from the previous year.
The outlook for 2006 was also bullish, with preliminary data for the first quarter indicating that FDI flows had already reached US$14 billion, up from US$7.4 billion in the year-earlier period.
ASEAN’s drive to establish a fully-fledged economic community has been underlined by implementation of its Priority Integration Sector Roadmaps.
By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa’s historical legacy of artificial and unmanageable colonial boundaries, ethnic antagonisms, its citizens’ deficit of self-respect, and an appalling record of leadership failures has hampered its quest for economic integration.
But a sector-by-sector approach could mitigate these handicaps, and, given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change, it might be strategically advisable to start with the energy sector.
Africa is a continent rich in energy, holding two-thirds of the world’s reserves of hydro-electric power – trillions of kilowatt-hours representing about half of total world resources.
The Congo River alone holds more than 600 billion kilowatt-hours of annual reserves.
The Sanaga (Cameroon) and the Ogooué (Gabon) hold half as much.
Technological breakthroughs have made it feasible to transport electricity via high-voltage direct current (HVDC) over long distances without incurring great losses (only about 3% per 1,000 kilometers).
Carbon-free hydroelectric power is the right choice as sub-Saharan Africa’s principal source of energy.
Harnessing the hydroelectric power of the Congo Basin alone would be enough to meet all of Africa’s energy needs, or to light the entire continent of South America.
Moreover, establishing an African grid would enable power from the Democratic Republic of Congo to be delivered to southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.
However, while 90% of world reserves of hydraulic energy are concentrated in underdeveloped regions like sub-Saharan Africa, HVDC technology remains the preserve of developed countries.
There is thus an imperative not only for regional integration in Africa, but also for a joint strategic vision and partnership to help build global energy and climate security.

The Consequences of the Israel-UAE Peace
TEL AVIV – Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has hailed the agreement normalizing relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates – which the two countries will sign at a White House ceremony on September 15 – as a historic step that equals Israel’s previous peace deals with Egypt and Jordan.
The Israeli leader also boasted that the agreement with the UAE vindicated his “Netanyahu doctrine” of peace for peace, rather than land for peace.
But even peace with a country with which Israel does not share a border and has never fought a war required Netanyahu to give up his plans to annex large parts of the West Bank.
So, there was a “land for peace” aspect to the deal after all.
More important, Netanyahu’s “doctrine” practically buries the concept underlying the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative: that an Israeli-Palestinian peace should be the precondition for normalization of Arab states’ relations with Israel.
The Arab League itself has rejected the Palestinians’ request to condemn the Israel-UAE deal, and the pact also signals the defeat of the Israeli left’s vision of Palestine as the key to peace with the Arab world.
Throughout the many decades of Arab-Israeli antagonism, Arab states have betrayed the Palestinians no less than Israel has.
In his 1979 peace agreement with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin made far-reaching commitments on the Palestinian question.
But both leaders knew that theirs was a separate peace driven by vital strategic needs – as shown by its subsequent survival despite Israel’s ever deepening occupation and settlement of Palestinian lands.
Why, then, has Mohammed bin Zayed, the UAE’s ruler, invited the rage of the betrayed Palestinians by normalizing relations with the Jewish state?
First, he proved to be a man with the courage to call things by their name.
Gulf states including the UAE and Saudi Arabia have had discreet security relations with Israel for years.
As a major military and technological power in the Middle East, Israel has become a necessary ally for conservative regimes shaken by the 2011 Arab Spring, the threat of Islamist radicalism, and Iran’s growing regional clout.
But it is mainly the fear of a withdrawal from the region by the United States that is bringing Arab states closer to Israel.
They saw how US President Donald Trump refrained from any direct military response to Iran’s devastating September 2019 attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil installations.
Moreover, Trump didn’t even respond to Iran’s downing a few months earlier of a sophisticated US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz.
The idea that peace with Israel also means peace with America had always been a fundamental motive behind the Arabs’ decision to consider reconciliation with the Jewish state.
Sadat signed the 1979 peace agreement because he wanted to shift Egypt’s strategic orientation from the Soviet Union to the US.
The $2 billion in annual military aid that Egypt still receives from the US is a direct product of that peace.
And Syria, Israel’s staunchest Arab enemy, became interested in peace only after the Soviet Union collapsed.
The Emiratis do not need America’s money, but they do need its continuous involvement in Middle Eastern affairs.
Israel is the guarantee that America will always be around, and offers the UAE a path into the US Congress, where arms deals and financial packages are approved.
The Trump administration’s apparent decision to sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to the UAE has been an important objective in the Emirati peace strategy toward Israel.
These advanced warplanes – which only the US and Israel currently possess – will secure America’s engagement with the UAE, and add muscle to a small country that has global ambitions and many enemies.
Chief among these foes are Qatar and Turkey.
Both countries support the Muslim Brotherhood, a UAE nemesis, which explains Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s virulent reaction to the normalization deal.
In Libya, the UAE is fighting together with Egypt and Russia in support of the Tobruk-based Libyan National Army led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, while Turkey and Qatar are backing the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.
The UAE has also sought to check Turkey’s punitive incursions against Kurdish forces in northern Syria.
Framing the Israel-UAE agreement as part of the continuous effort to contain Iran, as Netanyahu and the Trump administration are doing, is a convenient way to make the F-35 arms deal palatable to increasingly isolationist US public opinion.
The truth is that the UAE has been pursuing a prudent strategy vis-à-vis Iran.
It recently abandoned the Saudi-led coalition in the war against Iran’s Houthi proxies in Yemen, and has even disengaged from Trump’s sanctions regime against Iran.
Be that as it may, Netanyahu is right to say that the Palestinians are losing their most important strategic asset: their veto power over an all-Arab peace with Israel.
Bahrain has already announced that it will follow in the UAE’s footsteps, and more Arab countries are likely to do so as well.
The region is changing, and the Arabs are accepting that Israel is a legitimate strategic player.
Palestine, the supposed epicenter of the region’s worries, has become a disposable cause.
The Palestinians must recognize that they have brought this situation on themselves by their serial rejection of peace offers in the past.
How could they assume that the Arab states would forever mortgage their national interests in a changing region to fulfill Palestine’s implausible expectations?
Should they not now shift strategy, stop their “boycott” of the US, and engage Israel in the search for a realistic peace plan?

The Left’s Choice
CAMBRIDGE – The main political beneficiaries of the social and economic fractures wrought by globalization and technological change, it is fair to say, have so far been right-wing populists.
Politicians like Donald Trump in the United States, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil have ridden to power by capitalizing on the growing animus against established political elites and exploiting latent nativist sentiment.
The left and progressive groups have been largely missing in action.
The left’s relative weakness partly reflects the decline of unions and organized labor groups, which have historically formed the backbone of leftist and socialist movements.
But ideological abdication has also played an important role.
As parties of the left became more dependent on educated elites instead of the working class, their policy ideas aligned more closely with financial and corporate interests.
The remedies on offer from mainstream leftist parties remained correspondingly limited: more spending on education, improved social-welfare policies, a bit more progressivity in taxation, and little else.
The left’s program was more about sugarcoating the prevailing system than addressing the fundamental sources of economic, social, and political inequities.
There is now growing recognition that tax-and-transfer policies can go only so far.
While there is much room for improving social insurance and tax regimes, especially in the US, deeper reforms are needed to help level playing fields in favor of ordinary workers and families across a broad range of domains.
That means focusing on product, labor, and financial markets, on technology policies, and on the rules of the political game.
Inclusive prosperity cannot be achieved by simply redistributing income from the rich to the poor, or from the most productive parts of the economy to less productive sectors.
It requires less-skilled workers, smaller firms, and lagging regions to be more fully integrated with the most advanced parts of the economy.
In other words, we must start with productive re-integration of the domestic economy.
Large and productive firms have a critical role to play here.
They must recognize that their success depends on the public goods that their national and sub-national governments supply – everything from law and order and intellectual property rules to infrastructure and public investment in skills and research and development.
In exchange, they must invest in their local communities, suppliers, and workforce – not as corporate social responsibility, but as a mainline activity.
In an earlier age, governments engaged in agricultural extension activities to spread new techniques to small farmers.
There is a similar role today for what Timothy Bartik of the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research calls “manufacturing extension services,” though the ideas apply to productive services as well.
Governments that collaborate with businesses to encourage the dissemination of frontier technologies and management techniques to the rest of the economy can avail themselves of a well-established repertoire of such initiatives.
A second area of public action concerns the direction of technological change.
New technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI) have typically been labor-replacing, adversely affecting low-skill workers in particular.
But this need not be the case in the future.
Instead of policies (such as capital subsidies) that inadvertently promote labor-replacing technologies, governments could promote technologies that augment labor-market opportunities for less-skilled workers.
The late economist Tony Atkinson, in his magisterial book Inequality, questioned the wisdom of governments supporting the development of autonomous vehicles, without due consideration for the effects on taxi and truck drivers.
More recently, the economists Daron Acemoğlu, Anton Korinek, and Pascual Restrepo have written about how AI can be deployed in new ways to increase labor demand, for example by allowing ordinary workers to engage in activities that were previously out of reach for them.
But moving in this direction will require a conscious effort by governments to review their innovation policies and to put the appropriate private-sector incentives in place.
Labor markets, too, need rebalancing.
The weakening of unions and protections for workers has eroded traditional sources of countervailing power.
Recent research has shown that firms retain significant bargaining leverage over employees, depressing wages and working conditions.
Reversing these trends will require a range of pro-labor policies, including the promotion of unionization, higher minimum wages, and adequate regulatory standards for workers in the “gig economy.”
Finance is yet another area requiring significant surgery.
Most advanced economies’ financial sectors remain bloated.
They pose continuing risks to economic stability without providing compensating benefits in terms of increased investment in productive activities.
As Stanford’s Anat Admati and others have long argued, banks require, at a minimum, higher capital requirements and tighter regulatory scrutiny.
The fact that financial institutions have escaped relatively unscathed from the crisis of 2008-2009 speaks volumes about their political power.
As the failures of financial regulation suggest, important as such economic reforms are, they need to be complemented with measures that remedy the asymmetry of political access.
In the US, holding elections on workdays, rather than weekends or holidays – together with restrictive registration rules, gerrymandering, and myriad other electoral rules – places ordinary workers at a significant disadvantage.
This is on top of campaign finance rules that have enabled corporations and society’s wealthiest members to exert inordinate influence on legislation.
The Democratic Party will face a critical test in the next US presidential election, less than two years away.
In the meantime, it has a choice to make.
Will it remain the party of merely adding sweeteners to an unjust economic system?
Or does it have the courage to address unfair inequality by attacking it at its roots?

Free Trade and Costly Love
LONDON – The World Trade Organization’s ministerial conference in Bali in December produced a modest package of encouragements to global trade.
More broadly, the WTO’s multilateral approach has shown its worth by preventing a massive increase in trade barriers, unlike in 1929-1930, when protectionism helped deepen and broaden the Great Depression.
But the main question – whether globalization is a good thing, and for whom – remains unanswered.
The essence of globalization – free trade – rests on the theory of comparative advantage, which views international trade as profitable even for a country that can produce every commodity more cheaply (in terms of labor or all resources) than any other country.
The textbook example given by the Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson is that of a town’s best lawyer who is also its best typist.
Provided that he is better at law than at typing, he should specialize in law and leave his secretary to do the typing.
That way, both of their earnings will be higher.
The same logic applies to countries.
Each country should specialize in producing those things that it produces most efficiently, rather than producing a bit of everything, because that way its income will be higher.
Economists regard understanding the theory of comparative advantage as a test of professional competence.
But are the incompetents – say, the average person who believes that buying cheap imports from China destroys Western jobs – always wrong?
Samuelson, who called the theory of comparative advantage the most beautiful thing in economics, changed his tune a bit at the end of his life.
Free trade, he said, works fine with unchanging technology.
But if countries like China can combine Western technology with low wages, then trade with China will lower Western wages.
True, the West will be able to get its goods more cheaply; but, as Samuelson put it, “being able to purchase groceries 20% cheaper at Wal-Mart does not necessarily make up for the wage losses.”
Nor, he might have added, would being able to buy goods more cheaply compensate for many other good things in life that are sacrificed to efficiency.
The argument for free trade is an argument for welfare, but welfare defined exclusively in terms of money.
Time is money: the more money you can squeeze out of an hour’s work, the better off you are.
But what about all of the things that you enjoy doing, or that you think of as valuable, that do not maximize your earnings?
The economist responds that the more efficient you are at your work, the more time you will have for those other things.
The trouble is that the more you start to think of your welfare in terms of money, the more likely you are to regard spending time with your friends or making love as an “opportunity cost” – the loss of money you would have made by working instead – rather than a benefit.
The goal of squeezing as much money as possible out of time makes a great deal of sense in poor countries, where inefficient use of time can lead to starvation.
The whole point of economic development is, surely, to reduce the cost of inefficiency.
Yet economists, not noticing that their logic is less applicable to rich countries, continue trying to extend it to more and more areas of life.
A newly luxuriant research area is “life outsourcing.”
Paying someone else to fold your socks is a way to maximize your own earnings and those of the sock folder.
Even as penniless graduate students, the economists Jon Steinsson and Emi Nakamura borrowed money to pay people to do their household chores, calculating that “spending an extra hour working on a paper was better for their lifetime expected earnings than spending that same hour vacuuming.”
Likewise, the economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, pioneers of “lovenomics,” cite the tax code as a reason for not marrying.
They also conducted a cost/benefit analysis before having a child.
As Wolfers explains,
“The principle of comparative advantage tells us that gains from trade are largest when your trading partner has skills and endowments that are quite different from yours.
I’m an impractical bookish Harvard-trained empirical labor economist, while Betsey is an impractical and bookish Harvard-trained empirical labor economist.
When your skills are so similar, the gains from trade aren’t so large.
Except when it comes to bringing up our baby.
There, Betsey has a pair of, um, endowments that mean that she’s better at inputs.
And that means that I’m left to deal with outputs.”
As Stevenson helpfully clarifies, “it turns out that fathers can be pretty good at dealing with diapers.”
At this point, those untutored in economics are likely to start gnashing their teeth. “I enjoy doing lots of things that do not maximize my earning power,” they might protest.
But as soon as we accept the premise that to be rational is to seek to maximize one’s utility – defined in terms of consumption, with money the way to maximize it – the economist’s logic wins.
At that point, we must admit that it is irrational to spend time on long conversations with friends if it is time stolen from inventing, say, new software (unless the conversation helps the invention).
For Wolfers, it is a coincidence that what earns him the most money, economics, is also what he most enjoys doing.
Such reasoning crystallizes opposing views of the world, one in which time is a cost, and the other in which it is a benefit.
The first sees time spent on enjoyment as a missed opportunity; the second as part of the good life.
We should be clear about what is at stake in the choice between the two.

The Wages of Wage Fear
LONDON – If all else fails, try the previously unthinkable.
It is not a bad principle for economic policy in the best of times.
Today, it may be just what is needed: many Western countries – certainly the United States, Japan, and Germany, probably the United Kingdom, and soon much of the rest of the eurozone – should pursue direct government intervention in wage bargaining, especially for the lowest earners.
Japan has spent the last 15 years struggling with slow growth, anemic household demand (especially among poorer families), and rising inequality and poverty.
Similar conditions now prevail in the US as well; indeed, they helped Donald Trump to be elected president, by creating a sufficiently large group of what he quite reasonably called “forgotten Americans.”
And before Trump’s victory, such conditions spurred the UK’s so-called “left behind” to vote for Brexit.
Without a sharp increase in wages – mainly statutory minimum wages – populism will continue to thrive, and most Western economies will remain saddled with slow growth.
Inequality not just of income and wealth, but also of perceived political voice and influence, will continue to grow.
And the temptation to pursue shortsighted solutions – such as closing borders and implementing protectionism – will become irresistible.
Yet the suggestion that governments should act directly to raise the price of lower-skilled labor is likely to be met with sharp intakes of breath and sotto voce comments that I must be mad.
Don’t I know that higher minimum wages risk causing unemployment? Haven’t I heard of the “rise of the robots” and the growing power of automation, more generally, to destroy jobs?
Don’t I believe in market solutions?
The answer to all three questions is “yes.” But policies need to be tailored to conditions, and they need to reflect choices between the competing interests of different groups.
(Indeed, that is the whole point of politics.) And current conditions, together with the interests of the “left behind,” indicate that the once-unthinkable has become essential, if not inevitable.
The main reason why governments are leery of intervening in wage setting is the memory of the failed wage and price controls during the period of high inflation in the 1970s – controls that gave rise to large and troublesome distortions.
But a second, more current reason relates to lobbying from businesses, which argue that corporate competitiveness depends on cheap labor.
Governments also have their own self-interest to consider: the public sector often employs a lot of minimum-wage earners.
But it is time to take courage.
Fiscal policy – cutting taxes or raising public spending – is too constrained by high government debt to be much use in stimulating demand, and attempts to use it to redistribute resources from rich to poor have created their own problems.
Monetary policy – in particular, the vast money-printing “quantitative easing” programs pursued by central banks in recent years – has run out of space, too, with price inflation ticking up and central-bank balance sheets a record size.
Wage intervention is virtually the only option left.
Moreover, the risks of raising the minimum wage are probably not as great as they have been made out to be – at least not now.
To be sure, there are times when such wage increases can risk killing employment.
But today is not one of those times: countries like the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK are at virtually full employment.
The risk in these countries is not the risk of rising unemployment, but stagnating wages, which has caused household demand to remain depressed or grow only sluggishly, thereby deterring businesses from investing.
In the US, low wages at the bottom end of the labor market have discouraged millions of working-age individuals from even seeking employment. That certainly can help to reduce the official unemployment rate, but it does little for the economy.
The US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is one-third lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it was at its peak in 1968.
Japan’s average statutory minimum wage of ¥823 ($7.40) per hour is barely higher.
Even where the authorities have taken steps to raise minimum wages – the UK since last year, as well as US states like California and New York, which are targeting a $15 hourly minimum wage by 2020 – they are not moving fast or far enough.
Japan is raising its minimum wage only slightly faster than inflation.
Inequality remains the scourge of our era, with the bargaining power of the lowest-skilled workers severely undermined by automation and developing-country competition.
If “forgotten” groups are not to be permanently left behind and alienated, governments must take bolder action.
In the 1960s, Japan’s “income doubling” plan helped it to develop a consumer economy.
Perhaps the time has come to introduce a “minimum-wage doubling” plan, implemented over a few years, thus giving business the chance to adjust.
For leaders who have received the financial support of the very rich and the electoral support of those left behind, such a plan would seem to be a political winner.
Any interest, President Trump?

Climate Action Can Help to Fight Pandemics
BOSTON – The COVID-19 crisis has brought economies around the world to a standstill.
Huge swaths of manufacturing have been idled, and sectors such as aviation and tourism are largely shuttered.
Amid all the economic ruin, some have pointed to a supposed silver lining: cleaner air.
But while it is true that today’s lower air pollution will temporarily spare some people’s health, it is also true that winds are much calmer in the eye of a hurricane.
Last year, roughly six million people worldwide died as a consequence of air pollution produced from burning fossil fuels.
Such pollution will likely lead to nearly as many deaths in 2020, despite the cleaner air resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns.
Air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer, and diabetes.
Children who breathe contaminated air are more likely to suffer from asthma.
And polluted air can also harm pregnant women, resulting in premature or underweight babies.
But we can reduce this growing toll on our health.
As our economies kick back into gear after the threat from COVID-19 passes, we should implement climate solutions that will not only prevent the harms caused by air pollution, but also might just forestall the next pandemic.
A recent study by some of my Harvard colleagues provided the first clear evidence that a small increase in long-term exposure to particulate-matter air pollution can significantly increase the odds of someone dying from COVID-19.
This effect was apparent even after accounting for other factors, such as pre-existing health conditions, socioeconomic status, and access to health care.
Likewise, other researchers had previously shown that air pollution made people more likely to die from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus.
A 2003 study found that someone living in a highly polluted area of China was more than twice as likely to die from SARS than someone living in an area with cleaner air.
Chinese cities with high or moderate levels of air pollution had death rates of 8.9% and 7.5% respectively, compared to a 4% rate in areas with low air pollution.
Past research has also shown that air pollution can accelerate the spread of respiratory infections
Given this, it is no surprise that communities already suffering from air pollution – often communities of color and the poor – have been particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.
These populations are now experiencing a double burden: severe illness in the form of COVID-19, in addition to the well-known long-term harms from breathing contaminated air.
All this deepens existing economic and social injustices.
Poorer people are more likely to be laid off during the current pandemic, even in wealthier countries, and are also more likely to be exposed to the virus.
Governments can help to end this vicious cycle by speeding up climate action, including by adopting renewable energy and preventing deforestation.
By addressing the factors that drive the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, such policies will protect everyone, especially those most at risk.
During the current pandemic, however, some governments have moved to bail out polluting industries and weaken air-quality standards.
In the United States, federal authorities, citing the COVID-19 crisis, have suspended enforcement of environmental regulations.
And despite the expected impact on the climate, construction has started on the Keystone XL oil pipeline across the US-Canada border, while President Donald Trump’s administration recently rolled back vehicle fuel-efficiency standards.
Similarly, South Africa has slashed air-pollution standards for coal power plants, allowing them to emit twice as much sulfur dioxide as before.
And in Brazil, state protection of the Amazon rainforest, already dwindling ahead of the fire season, has weakened further as a result of COVID-19 risks, with fewer enforcement agents going out into the field.
Today, governments are rightly focused on meeting their citizens’ immediate needs.
But as we start to rebuild from this pandemic, we must pressure policymakers to ensure that structural changes do not reinforce business-as-usual scenarios by propping up polluting industries.
Instead, we must improve air quality by expanding renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, and building innovative transportation systems.
These measures will save lives, protect communities against pandemic risks, and help to ensure a livable climate for our children.
As Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, recently put it, “COVID-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term.” She is right, and one of the most effective ways to fend off acute threats like COVID-19 is to tackle the larger global crisis we face.

Brexit’s Impact on the World Economy
LONDON – The febrile behavior of financial markets ahead of the United Kingdom’s referendum on June 23 on whether to remain in the European Union shows that the outcome will influence economic and political conditions around the world far more profoundly than Britain’s roughly 2.4% share of global GDP might suggest.
There are three reasons for this outsize impact.
First, the “Brexit” referendum is part of a global phenomenon: populist revolts against established political parties, predominantly by older, poorer, or less-educated voters angry enough to tear down existing institutions and defy “establishment” politicians and economic experts.
Indeed, the demographic profile of potential Brexit voters is strikingly similar to that of American supporters of Donald Trump and French adherents of the National Front.
Opinion polls indicate that British voters back the “Leave”campaign by a wide margin, 65% to 35%, if they did not complete high school, are over 60, or have “D, E” blue-collar occupations.
By contrast, university graduates, voters under 40, and members of the “A, B” professional classes plan to vote “Remain” by similar margins of 60% to 40% and higher.
In Britain, the United States, and Germany, the populist rebellions are not only fueled by similar perceived grievances and nationalist sentiments, but also are occurring in similar economic conditions.
All three countries have returned to more or less full employment, with unemployment rates of around 5%.
But many of the jobs created pay low wages, and immigrants have recently displaced bankers as scapegoats for all social ills.
The degree of mistrust of business leaders, mainstream politicians, and expert economists is evident in the extent to which voters are ignoring their warnings not to endanger the gradual restoration of prosperity by upending the status quo.
In Britain, after three months of debate about Brexit, only 37% of voters agree that Britain would be worse off economically if it left the EU – down from 38% a year ago.
In other words, all the voluminous reports – by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the World Bank, and the British government and the Bank of England – unanimously warning of significant losses from Brexit have been disregarded.
Rather than trying to rebut the experts’ warnings with detailed analyses, Boris Johnson, the leader of the Leave campaign, has responded with bluster and rhetoric identical to Trump’s anti-politics: “Who is remotely apprehensive about leaving?
Oh believe me, it will be fine.” In other words, the so-called experts were wrong in the past, and they are wrong now.
This kind of frontal attack on political elites has been surprisingly successful in Britain, judging by the latest Brexit polling.
But only after the votes are counted will we know whether opinions expressed to pollsters predicted actual voting behavior.
This is the second reason why the Brexit result will echo around the world.
The referendum will be the first big test of whether it is the experts and markets, or the opinion polls, that have been closer to the truth about the strength of the populist upsurge.
For now, political pundits and financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic assume, perhaps complacently, that what angry voters tell pollsters does not reflect how they will actually vote.
Analysts and investors have consistently assigned low odds to insurgent victories: in late May, betting markets and computerized models put the probabilities of Trump’s election and of Brexit at only around 25%, despite the fact that opinion polls showed almost 50% support for both.
This is not because US voters will be influenced by Britain; of course they will not be. But, in addition to all the economic, demographic, and social similarities, opinion polling in the US and Britain now face very similar challenges and uncertainties, owing to the breakdown of traditional political allegiances and dominant two-party systems.
Statistical theory even allows us to quantify how expectations about the US presidential election should shift if Brexit wins in Britain.
Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that we start by giving equal credibility to opinion polls showing Brexit and Trump with almost 50% support and expert opinions, which gave them only a 25% chance.
Now suppose that Brexit wins.
A statistical formula called Bayes’ theorem then shows that belief in opinion polls would increase from 50% to 67%, while the credibility of expert opinion would fall from 50% to 33%.
This leads to the third, and most worrying, implication of the British vote.
If Brexit wins in a country as stable and politically phlegmatic as Britain, financial markets and businesses around the world will be shaken out of their complacency about populist insurgencies in the rest of Europe and the US.
These heightened market concerns will, in turn, change economic reality.
As in 2008, financial markets will amplify economic anxiety, breeding more anti-establishment anger and fueling still-higher expectations of political revolt.
The threat of such contagion means a Brexit vote could be the catalyst for another global crisis.
This time, however, the workers who lose their jobs, the pensioners who lose their savings, and the homeowners who are trapped in negative equity will not be able to blame “the bankers.”
Those who vote for populist upheavals will have no one but themselves to blame when their revolutions go wrong.

From Great Moderation to Great Stagflation
NEW YORK – The world economy is undergoing a radical regime shift.
The decades-long Great Moderation is over.
Coming after the stagflation (high inflation and severe recessions) of the 1970s and early 1980s, the Great Moderation was characterized by low inflation in advanced economies; relatively stable and robust economic growth, with short and shallow recessions; low and falling bond yields (and thus positive returns on bonds), owing to the secular fall in inflation; and sharply rising values of risky assets such as US and global equities.
This extended period of low inflation is usually explained by central banks’ move to credible inflation-targeting policies after the loose monetary policies of the 1970s, and governments’ adherence to relatively conservative fiscal policies (with meaningful stimulus coming only during recessions).
But, more important than demand-side policies were the many positive supply shocks, which increased potential growth and reduced production costs, thus keeping inflation in check.
During the post-Cold War era of hyper-globalization, China, Russia, and other emerging-market economies became more integrated in the world economy, supplying it with low-cost goods, services, energy, and commodities.
Large-scale migration from the Global South to the North kept a lid on wages in advanced economies, technological innovations reduced the costs of producing many goods and services, and relative geopolitical stability allowed for an efficient allocation of production to the least-costly locations without worries about investment security.
But the Great Moderation started to crack during the 2008 global financial crisis and then during the 2020 COVID-19 recession.
In both cases, inflation initially remained low given demand shocks, and loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies prevented deflation from setting in.
But now inflation is back, rising sharply, especially over the past year, owing to a mix of both demand and supply factors.
On the supply side, the backlash against hyper-globalization has been gaining momentum, creating opportunities for populist, nativist, and protectionist politicians.
Public anger over stark income and wealth inequalities also has been building, leading to more policies to support workers and the “left behind.”
However well-intentioned, these policies are now contributing to a dangerous spiral of wage-price inflation.
Making matters worse, renewed protectionism (from both the left and the right) has restricted trade and the movement of capital.
Political tensions (both within and between countries) are driving a process of reshoring (and “friend-shoring”).
Political resistance to immigration has curtailed the global movement of people, putting additional upward pressure on wages.
National-security and strategic considerations have further restricted flows of technology, data, and information.
And new labor and environmental standards, important as they may be, are hampering both trade and new construction.
This balkanization of the global economy is deeply stagflationary, and it is coinciding with demographic aging, not just in developed countries, but also in large emerging economies such as China.
Because young people tend to produce and save, whereas older people spend down their savings, this trend also is stagflationary.
The same is true of today’s geopolitical turmoil.
Russia’s war in Ukraine, and the West’s response to it, has disrupted the trade of energy, food, fertilizers, industrial metals, and other commodities.
The Western decoupling from China is accelerating across all dimensions of trade (goods, services, capital, labor, technology, data, and information).
Other strategic rivals to the West may soon add to the havoc.
Iran crossing the nuclear-weapons threshold would likely provoke military strikes by Israel or even the United States, triggering a massive oil shock; and North Korea is still regularly rattling its nuclear saber.
Now that the US dollar has been fully weaponized for strategic and national-security purposes, its position as the main global reserve currency may begin to decline, and a weaker dollar would of course add to the inflationary pressures.
A frictionless world trading system requires a frictionless financial system.
But sweeping primary and secondary sanctions have thrown sand in this well-oiled machine, massively increasing the transaction costs of trade.
On top of it all, climate change, too, is stagflationary.
Droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and other disasters are increasingly disrupting economic activity and threatening harvests (thus driving up food prices).
At the same time, demands for decarbonization have led to underinvestment in fossil-fuel capacity before investment in renewables has reached the point where they can make up the difference.
Today’s large energy-price spikes were thus inevitable.
Pandemics will also be a persistent threat, lending further momentum to protectionist policies as countries rush to hoard critical supplies of food, medicines, and other essential goods.
After two and a half years of COVID-19, we now have monkeypox.
And owing to human encroachments on fragile ecosystems and the melting of Siberian permafrost, we may soon be dealing with dangerous viruses and bacteria that have been locked away for millennia.
Finally, cyberwarfare remains an underappreciated threat to economic activity and even public safety.
Firms and governments will either face more stagflationary disruptions to production, or they will have to spend a fortune on cybersecurity.
Either way, costs will rise.
On the demand side, loose and unconventional monetary, fiscal, and credit policies have become not a bug but rather a feature of the new regime.
Between today’s surging stocks of private and public debts (as a share of GDP) and the huge unfunded liabilities of pay-as-you-go social-security and health systems, both the private and public sectors face growing financial risks.
Central banks are thus locked in a “debt trap”: any attempt to normalize monetary policy will cause debt-servicing burdens to spike, leading to massive insolvencies, cascading financial crises, and fallout in the real economy.
With governments unable to reduce high debts and deficits by spending less or raising revenues, those that can borrow in their own currency will increasingly resort to the “inflation tax”: relying on unexpected price growth to wipe out long-term nominal liabilities at fixed rates.
Thus, as in the 1970s, persistent and repeated negative supply shocks will combine with loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies to produce stagflation.
Moreover, high debt ratios will create the conditions for stagflationary debt crises.
During the Great Stagflation, both components of any traditional asset portfolio – long-term bonds and US and global equities – will suffer, potentially incurring massive losses.

Madonna and Child
In October, hundreds of millions of people all over the world learned about a one-year-old boy from Malawi called David.
A month before, it seems safe to assume, many of these people had never heard of his native land, a landlocked African nation of about 13 million people bordering Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania.
Suddenly, David became the world’s best-known Malawian because it was his good fortune to be adopted by Madonna, the pop star who is to TV cameras what honey is to bears.
But was it really good fortune?
David’s father, Yohane Banda, suddenly in the media spotlight, said he had not understood that his son no longer belonged to him and might never return to Malawi.
Madonna says that that is not what Banda said earlier, although she does not speak his language.
Was it good for the boy, people asked, to be separated from his father?
Human rights advocates began court action to demand his return.
David’s mother is dead.
After her death, his father, a villager who grows vegetables and gets other work when he can, was unable to care for him, and placed him in an orphanage.
There, until Madonna came into contact with him, he was living with about 500 other children.
Largely due to Malawi’s HIV/AIDS epidemic, the country has a million such orphans.
Resources at the orphanages are limited, and many of the children there do not live to their fifth birthday.
Madonna said that when she met David, he had severe pneumonia and was breathing with difficulty.
Malawi is one of the world’s least developed countries, with an infant mortality rate of 94 per thousand and a life expectancy at birth of 41 years. Of the adult population, about one in seven have HIV/AIDS.
Left in the orphanage, there is no reason to think that David would have done better than the average Malawian.
Most likely, he would have done worse. In an interview, David’s father did not deny that his son would be better off with Madonna, and he refused to support the human rights activists seeking David’s return.
That seems a wise decision.
Admittedly, David will be cut off from his cultural roots.
Although Madonna has said that she will bring him back to Malawi to see his father again, he will scarcely be able to feel at home there.
His mother tongue will be English; if he ever learns to speak his father’s language, it will be as a foreigner.
Nor will he be entirely at home in London, especially in the circles in which Madonna moves.
A black child in a largely white world, he will always be “the orphan Madonna adopted.”
The difficulties of living in such circumstances, however, are surely less daunting than the hazards David would have faced had he stayed in the orphanage – assuming that he would have survived at all.
But there is a broader issue at stake in David’s case.
In adopting a child from a poor country, Madonna is following an example set by other celebrities like Mia Farrow, Ewan McGregor, and Angelina Jolie.
Do such adoptions achieve anything more than helping the individual children adopted?
Adopting children from developing countries does not address the causes of poverty.
Despite the high rate of HIV/AIDS infections, Malawi’s population, like that of many developing nations, is growing rapidly.
It is projected to surpass 19 million by 2025.
That will put more pressure on the country’s already limited stock of agricultural land.
Educating young Malawians, especially girls, and making contraceptives widely available, would do much more to slow population growth than a few inter-country adoptions.
To her credit, Madonna is doing more than adopting David.
Her project, “Raising Malawi” ( www.raisingmalawi.com ), will help other orphans.
More importantly, with other partners, Raising Malawi collects funds for agricultural assistance, medical care, and education for villagers as well.
Along with Angelina Jolie, Bono, George Soros, and many others, Raising Malawi is assisting Millennium Promise ( www.millenniumpromise.org ), an organization founded by the prominent Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs.
The promises of the United Nations Millennium Summit, signed by all the world’s leaders, included halving extreme poverty, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS, and providing primary education for all children by 2015.
Although good progress in meeting these goals has been made in Asia, in Africa there are now 140 million more people living in extreme poverty than there were in 1990.
Skeptics doubt that foreign aid really helps.
Millennium Promise seeks to respond to that skepticism one village at a time.
By selecting particular villages and providing basic health care, bed nets to stop malaria, primary education, better seeds, and other agricultural assistance, the organization aims to show that well-designed, comprehensive aid plans can, at relatively modest cost, raise people out of poverty.
One can only regret that the media seem less interested in this exciting and momentous story, which has the potential to help millions of children, than in Madonna’s adoption of a single Malawian infant.

Beggar-Thy-Neighbor Exchange Rates?
GENEVA – When the Swiss National Bank (SNB) recently brought its interest rate down to 0.25%, it announced that it would engage in “quantitative easing,” following in the footsteps of the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
More surprising was the simultaneous announcement that it was intervening on the foreign-exchange market with the aim of reversing the appreciation of the franc.
Will this be the first salvo in a war of competitive devaluations?
Interest rates are traditionally low in Switzerland.
Like most other central banks confronted with the recession, the SNB has reduced its policy interest rate all the way to the zero lower bound.
Once there, traditional monetary policy becomes impotent, as the interest-rate tool is no longer usable.
This is why central banks are now searching for new instruments.
Quantitative easing represents one such attempt.
It remains to be seen whether it can effectively restore some monetary-policy influence.
However, an important issue is rarely mentioned: in small, open economies – a description that applies to almost every country except the US – the main channel of monetary policy is the exchange rate.
This channel is ignored for one good reason: exchange-rate policies are fundamentally of the beggar-thy-neighbor variety.
Unconventional policies that aim at weakening the exchange rate are technically possible even at zero interest rates, and they are quite likely to be effective at the level of individual countries.
Boosting competitiveness through exchange-rate depreciation may not succeed in raising exports in a situation where world trade is rapidly contracting, but it can cushion the blow by switching demand toward domestically produced goods and services.
The risk is that those countries that suffer from the switch retaliate and depreciate their own currencies. That could easily trigger a return to the much-feared competitive depreciations that contributed to the Great Depression.
The first casualty would be whatever small scope remains for international policy coordination.
The second would be the world international monetary system.
In fact, one key reason for the creation of the International Monetary Fund was to monitor exchange-rate developments with the explicit aim of preventing beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
This is why the Swiss move comes as a surprise.
It is true that the franc has appreciated in real terms by 8% since the crisis started in August 2007. This is commonly attributed to the currency reputation as a safe haven during troubled times.
What this really means is that the appreciation is neither a consequence of monetary policy nor the other usual factors.
In any case, while the Swiss authorities’ discomfort with the situation is understandable, their decision is disquieting.
The Swiss franc is not the only currency that has appreciated in recent months.
Other small economies have undergone even sharper real appreciations.
For example, Poland and the Czech Republic have seen their currencies go up by close to 30% and 15%, respectively.
Major countries also have undergone currency appreciations – 30% for Japan and 15% for China.
These countries, too, are facing a recession, and, while the interest rate has not yet reached its zero bound everywhere, incentives to depreciate might grow in the near future.
In fact, the incentives are already there.
Some fairly large countries – Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, to name a few – have already undergone some very large depreciations.
In fact, Poland’s currency recently started to depreciate.
None of these countries’ central banks has indicated that it was involved in depreciating its currency.
Of course, statements and intentions may not be identical.
It may be that the SNB merely acknowledges what other central banks do not.
In doing so, however, the SNB is violating a taboo: “Thou shall not engage in competitive depreciations.”
Alternatively, it may be that the SNB mostly wishes to talk the franc down to break the safe-haven effect.
Having promptly achieved depreciation, it may have succeeded.
In that case, the franc will not move much more, in any direction, and there will be no need for further interventions.
Nevertheless, the limited reaction to the SNB move is somewhat surprising.
The move came one week after the IMF concluded its annual Article IV visit to Switzerland, and the report has yet to be released; it could make for unusually interesting reading.
Other central banks have not expressed any view, which may suggest that they do not intend to retaliate, at least at this stage.
They may have been reassured by the SNB’s official statement that the appreciation represented “an inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions,” and that the policy move merely aims “to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.”
It may also be that notice has been taken of the precedent, and that those authorities that intend to use it to justify future moves are loathe to criticize it.
In that case, the generalized silence could indicate that all other central banks entertain the possibility of using that option, which would be most worrisome.

Cycling and Cancer
The cyclist Lance Armstrong recently celebrated an anniversary. It has been ten years since he was diagnosed with metastatic testicular cancer, which his doctors believed would kill him.
Based on his inspiring story and his efforts to publicize the disease, Armstrong has become an anti-cancer crusader.
But on examining his foundation’s website ( www.laf.org ) and his writings, a nagging question remains: Did the same tenacity that enabled Armstrong to win seven Tour de France bicycle races help cure his cancer?
Armstrong is careful not to equate cycling with cancer, but he—and his legions of fans—often cannot help but do so.
Such a connection may be highly misleading.
By his early twenties, Armstrong was becoming a force in the racing world, but all was not well.
In 1996, at age 25, Armstrong developed fatigue, testicular pain and a bloody cough.
Doctors diagnosed him with testicular cancer.
More distressingly, Armstrong’s cancer was far-advanced, having spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain.
He was given roughly a 40% chance of survival, which was probably an overestimate.
One doctor told Armstrong’s mother that her son would die.
After undergoing surgery to remove his cancerous testicle, Armstrong became “a student of cancer.”
He was treated at Indiana University, perhaps America’s leading center for testicular cancer.
Armstrong chose Indiana because its oncologists said they could treat him without bleomycin, a type of chemotherapy that would have damaged his lungs and ended his cycling career if he survived.
They removed his brain tumors with surgery instead of radiation, which might have caused balance problems.
But the doctors made no bones about what Armstrong was to receive: extremely caustic drugs that would make him sick as a dog.
Armstrong later wrote that “by the fourth cycle [of chemotherapy], I was in the fetal position, retching around the clock.”
Armstrong’s cancer responded extremely well. He then underwent extensive rehabilitation, gradually regaining strength and confidence.
By 1998, he was again riding his bicycle.
The illness changed Armstrong’s body.
When he resumed serious training, he was leaner and more muscular.
In addition to the emotional advantage that Armstrong believed that cancer gave him, his new body also made him a more effective cyclist.
In 1999, less than three years after his diagnosis, Armstrong won his first Tour de France.
Six more followed, making him the greatest cyclist in history.
For his part, Armstrong has tried to steer clear of facile associations between his Tour de France triumphs and his recovery from cancer.
“Good, strong people get cancer,” he has written, “and they do all the right things to beat it, and they still die.”
Perhaps he was a racing hero, Armstrong has stated, but “it wasn’t heroic to survive cancer.”
Even though he participated in his care and had excellent doctors, his survival was “more a matter of blind luck.”
Still, at times, Armstrong seems to slip into the sort of language he wishes to avoid.
At the close of his second book, Armstrong summarized his history with cancer as: “I got treated, I fought like hell, and I got better.”
A quotation on his foundation’s website reads “When I was sick, I didn’t want to die.
When I race I don’t want to lose.
Dying and losing, it’s the same thing.”
More worrisome is the adoption of the same reasoning by those who hear Armstrong’s story.
“Lance refused to become a statistic and instead rallied and became cancer’s worst enemy,” wrote a reviewer of his first book.
“He refused to give in and chose to fight the disease with all he had.” An Internet biography states that “with the same fierce focus he brings to competition,” Armstrong “tackled his illness and won.”
To some people, Armstrong has become a symbol for the notion that anything is possible.
“Lance beat cancer and then he went on to win 5 Tour de Frances,” a computer programmer wrote on his blog in 2003. “That pretty much means I can overcome whatever ills I have in my life so I can keep going after that.”
The trouble is that data about the “will to live” among cancer patients are not so rosy.
One 1989 study showed that women with metastatic breast cancer who attended support groups survived longer, but these results have not been duplicated.
A recent study showed that a positive attitude did not lengthen the lives of lung cancer patients.
Anecdotally, clinicians can recall “fighters” with cancer who die and others who “give up” but live.
This is a sobering message for Armstrong’s many fans.
After all, we all want to think that hard work always pays off.
Unfortunately, in the world of cancer, this may not be so.
But Armstrong’s legacy is about more than data.
He has educated and provided inspiration to thousands, perhaps millions, of cancer patients and raised money that is being used to finding cures.
Oh, and there are those seven bike races that he won.

Japan's Leadership Muddle
OSAKA – Having seen a new prime minister every year for five consecutive years, Japan has just narrowly avoided having its third in 2010.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan has been elected President of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), surviving a challenge from Ichiro Ozawa, the DPJ’s most potent behind-the-scenes power broker.
Had Nan lost to Ozawa, he would have lost the premiership to him as well.
With DPJ lawmakers almost equally split, Kan’s victory is being attributed to the support of general and associate party members.
Their vote was more in line with recent public-opinion polls, which showed popular support running at seven-to-two in favor of Kan over Ozawa.
Only three months ago, Kan was chosen as the DPJ’s top leader to restore its public image, which had been severely tarnished by political-financing scandals involving his predecessor as prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, and a separate scandal involving Ozawa.
Hatoyama’s mismanagement of Japan’s relations with the United States, centered on the relocation of a Marine base in Okinawa, had also dented the DPJ’s standing.
From the moment the DPJ took power in 2009, Kan was tacitly slated to be Hatoyama’s successor, given that he was concurrently Hatoyama’s deputy prime minister and treasury minister.
In these posts, Kan avoided involvement with the two issues that wrecked Hatoyama’s premiership: the controversial base relocation issue, and debates over budget cuts.
Consequently, he was aloof from the DPJ’s feud with Japan’s powerful bureaucratic mandarins, who are desperately trying to safeguard the longstanding bureaucratic/cabinet system in which the once-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) passed mandarin-drafted, cabinet-sponsored bills and budgets, almost continuously, for five decades.
Surprisingly, Kan, who entered politics to dismantle the old system, now has switched to the mandarins’ side.
The DPJ suffered a bitter defeat in this summer’s upper-house election, after Kan abruptly proposed a significant increase in the highly unpopular consumption tax.
That increase would enable Treasury mandarins to maintain their latitude in setting fiscal policy, while making it unnecessary to streamline special-account budget financing for gargantuan public corporations, into which retiring bureaucrats parachute for lucrative jobs.
Moreover, Kan’s approach to the base relocation issue revived the old LDP plan, which the DPJ had previously denounced.
Kan’s retreat means that the mandarins continue to hold the reins of foreign and defense policy.
Even if Kan had failed to win the upper-house election, the mandarins would have faced a weakened DPJ.
Either way, they won.
Small wonder, then, that Hatoyama advocated replacing Kan with Ozawa, even though Hatoyama insisted that Ozawa resign when he was forced from the premiership three months ago.
Both are openly opposed not only to the tax increase, but also to the continuing presence of the US Marine base on Okinawa.
While committed to the bilateral US-Japan alliance, Ozawa has said that Japan’s security requires the continued presence only of the US Seventh Fleet, not of US ground troops.
Evidently, he is trying to redefine the relationship, probably with a view to enhancing Japan’s freedom of maneuver in foreign and security policy.
Despite his confusing signals, Ozawa’s stance is neither pro-China nor anti-American, given that he most recently emphasized Japan’s sovereignty over the Senkaku islands as an integral part of its territory – a position that China strongly disputes.
Logically, Ozawa’s approach involves a significant military buildup, but he remains silent about how to maintain effective deterrence once the US Marines leave Okinawa.
Kan’s status quo approach to alliance management won’t hold up long, because Hatoyama’s bungling has inflated Okinawans’ expectations about evicting the Marines.
The current governor will likely block any construction to relocate a base on the island, exercising a de facto veto, particularly with the gubernatorial election due in late November.
Only by equivocating about the relocation plan could Kan appease both the governor and US President Barack Obama, who is scheduled to meet Kan in Tokyo the same month.
Japan and America can now agree only on what will not be implemented.
The DPJ is caught between a rock and a hard place, and Kan’s premiership will surely reach a stalemate.
Because the DPJ has neither an upper-house majority nor the two-thirds lower-house majority needed to override upper-house votes, his government will be unable to pass budget and/or appropriation bills by the end of the current fiscal year, March 31, 2011.
Ozawa, had he become prime minister, would inevitably have been subjected to not only similar obstruction in Diet sessions but also to interrogation about his financing scandal, while fearing prosecution.
An Ozawa government might be stable only if he could form a grand coalition. Yet, given strong public sentiment against Ozawa, that is impossible.
Meanwhile, Ozawa’s electoral challenge has left the DPJ more divided than ever.
In order to ride out the hung Diet, Kan will have to reconstruct party unity by replacing at least the incumbent anti-Ozawa party chief or Chief Cabinet Secretary, and, possibly, by appointing a pro-Ozawa Justice Minister – i.e., someone who can block Ozawa’s prosecution in the financing scandal.
Appeasing Ozawa, however, is contrary to public sentiment and detrimental to the DPJ’s hopes of regaining popular support.
For the moment, Japan’s political situation is stable, but that will last for the next six months, at most.
The time is fast approaching when the public becomes entirely disillusioned with both the LDP and the DPJ, which comprise a two-party system in name only, in which legislators shift allegiance for reasons centered on attachment to or enmity against the LDP.
Without a grand reorganization of the major political parties along ideological lines, Japan’s domestic and foreign policies – including relations with the US – will remain a muddle.

America Confronts Old and New Europe
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's petulant remark of last year about "old and new Europe" was right for the wrong reasons.
He meant it to refer to Europe's divisions, but in May, ten additional states joined the European Union. The expanded Europe truly forms a new Europe.
Should America be nervous?
Fifty-four years after the announcement of the Schuman Plan that began to knit together the economies of France and Germany, the EU now has 25 countries and a population larger than that of the United States.
Eight of the new members are former Communist countries that were locked behind the Iron Curtain for nearly half a century.
Their attraction to the Union is a sign of the appeal - the "soft power" - of the idea of European unification.
Of course, this new Europe faces many problems.
The per capita income of the new countries is less than half of that of the fifteen members they are joining.
Concerns have been raised about the influx of cheap labor. But average GDP growth rates in the new members are twice as high as in the original members, and this can provide a welcome stimulus to stagnant labor markets and sluggish economies.
Political arrangements are somewhat more problematic.
Negotiations are underway to revise a draft EU constitution. Some Europeans worry that the constitution will enable courts to carry the integration process further and faster than public opinion in member states will tolerate.
Lack of grassroots support might lead to rejection of the constitution in countries like Britain, where referenda have been promised before the new arrangements come into force.
Across the Atlantic, most Americans (to the extent they pay attention) regard these changes with general approval.
But some express concern that the new Europe will be defined in opposition to the US.
Not only do the remarks of French leaders about recreating a multi-polar world arouse alarm, but recent public opinion polls show a decline in the popularity of the US among Europeans and a desire for more independent policies.
The Iraq War proved costly to American soft power, with the US losing about 30 percentage points of attractiveness on average in Europe, including in countries like Britain, Spain, and Italy, whose governments supported the war.
The recent photographs of detainees being abused and sexually degraded in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison added fuel to the fire.
Now some American neo-conservatives argue that the US should drop its longstanding support for European integration.
Such a policy change would be a serious mistake.
Not only would it add to anti-American attitudes and fail to accomplish its objectives, but it over-estimates the extent to which the new Europe is being formed in opposition to the US. Whatever the rhetoric in France, for example, the policies and attitudes in countries such as Britain or Poland demonstrate that good trans-Atlantic relations can be maintained.
If anything, the risks of a US-Europe split will be reduced rather than increased by the EU's recent enlargement.
Moreover, there are several objective reasons why the current friction between Europe and the US is unlikely to lead to divorce.
For one thing, the divisive war in Iraq may turn out to be the last act of the twentieth century rather than a harbinger of the twenty-first.
American unilateralism is much less in evidence in the world's other hot spots, such as North Korea and Iran, both because of the costs of the war in Iraq and the realities of the situation in those other regions.
Moreover, while the common security threat from the Soviet Union has disappeared, both the US and Europe face a new common threat from radical jihadist terrorism.
Neither side of the Atlantic is immune to the threat, despite the efforts of Osama bin Laden to drive a wedge between Europe and America.
Transnational terrorism can only be confronted by close civilian cooperation such as intelligence sharing, police work across borders, and tracing financial flows.
These forms of cooperation survived the divisions over Iraq.
Europe and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values.
While trade produces frictions in democracies, it also enhances wealth.
If one looks at foreign direct investment, it is clear that the two sides of the Atlantic are closely integrated.
In terms of values, while some differences exist between Europe and America, at the fundamental level of democracy and human rights, no other two parts of the globe share more.
As the writer Robert Kagan concluded in the revision of his book in which he declared Europeans to be from Venus and Americans from Mars, it turns out that Americans seeking democratic legitimization of their policies and self-images cannot escape Europe.
In short, it is good for Americans - and for the world - that old and new Europe are becoming one.
We can all benefit from the soft power of an enlarged Europe.

The End of the New Normal?
WASHINGTON, DC – Just when the notion that Western economies are settling into a “new normal” of low growth gained mainstream acceptance, doubts about its continued relevance have begun to emerge.
Instead, the world may be headed toward an economic and financial crossroads, with the direction taken depending on key policy decisions.
In the early days of 2009, the “new normal” was on virtually no one’s radar.
Of course, the global financial crisis that had erupted a few months earlier threw the world economy into turmoil, causing output to contract, unemployment to surge, and trade to collapse.
Dysfunction was evident in even the most stable and sophisticated segments of financial markets.
Yet most people’s instinct was to characterize the shock as temporary and reversible – a V-shape disruption, featuring a sharp downturn and a rapid recovery.
After all, the crisis had originated in the advanced economies, which are accustomed to managing business cycles, rather than in the emerging-market countries, where structural and secular forces dominate.
But some observers already saw signs that this shock would prove more consequential, with the advanced economies finding themselves locked into a frustrating and unusual long-term low-growth trajectory.
In May 2009, my PIMCO colleagues and I went public with this hypothesis, calling it the “new normal.”
The concept received a rather frosty reception in academic and policy circles – an understandable response, given strong conditioning to think and act cyclically.
Few were ready to admit that the advanced economies had bet the farm on the wrong growth model, much less that they should look to the emerging economies for insight into structural impediments to growth, including debt overhangs and excessive inequalities.
But the economy was not bouncing back.
On the contrary, not only did slow growth and high unemployment persist for years, but the inequality trifecta (income, wealth, and opportunity) worsened as well.
The consequences extended beyond economics and finance, straining regional political arrangements, amplifying national political dysfunction, and fueling the rise of anti-establishment parties and movements.
With the expectation of a V-shape recovery increasingly difficult to justify, the “new normal” finally gained widespread acceptance.
In the process, it acquired some new labels.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned in October 2014 that the advanced economies were facing a “new mediocre.”
Former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers foresaw an era of “secular stagnation.”
Today, it is no longer unusual to suggest that the West could linger in a low-level growth equilibrium for an unusually prolonged period.
Yet, as I explain in my new book The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse, growing internal tensions and contradictions, together with over-reliance on monetary policy, are destabilizing that equilibrium.
Indeed, with financial bubbles growing, the nature of financial risk morphing, inequality worsening, and non-traditional – and in some cases extreme – political forces continuing to gain traction, the calming influence of unconventional monetary policies is being stretched to its limits.
The prospect that such policies will be able to keep the economic engines humming, even at low levels, looks increasingly dim.
Instead, the world economy seems to be headed for another crossroads, which I expect it to reach within the next three years.
This may not be a bad thing.
If policymakers implement a more comprehensive response, they can put their economies on a more stable and prosperous path – one of high inclusive growth, declining inequality, and genuine financial stability.
Such a policy response would have to include pro-growth structural reforms (such as higher infrastructure investment, a tax overhaul, and labor retooling), more responsive fiscal policy, relief for pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improved global coordination.
This, together with technological innovations and the deployment of sidelined corporate cash, would unleash productive capacity, producing faster and more inclusive growth, while validating asset prices, which are now artificially elevated.
The alternate path, onto which continued political dysfunction would push the world, leads through a thicket of parochial and uncoordinated policies to economic recession, greater inequality, and severe financial instability.
Beyond harming the economic wellbeing of current and future generations, this outcome would undermine social and political cohesion.
There is nothing pre-destined about which of these two paths will be taken.
Indeed, as it stands, the choice is frustratingly impossible to predict.
But in the coming months, as policymakers face intensifying financial volatility, we will see some clues concerning how things will play out.
The hope is that they point to a more systematic – and thus effective – policy approach.
The fear is that policies will fail to pivot away from excessive reliance on central banks, and end up looking back to the new normal, with all of its limitations and frustrations, as a period of relative calm and wellbeing.

The Case for Constructive Populism
WASHINGTON, DC – The Brexit vote has unleashed a huge amount of commentary on anti-establishment politics, the failure of experts, the abdication of the left, and much else.
Juxtaposed to the presidential campaign in the United States, Brexit is regarded by many as a wake-up call.
In response, former US Treasury Secretary and former president of Harvard Larry Summers is calling for “responsible nationalism” to counter the often chauvinistic, anti-immigrant, and protectionist language of the populist right.
It would be “understood that countries are expected to pursue their citizens’ economic welfare as a primary objective but where their ability to harm the interests of citizens elsewhere is circumscribed.” We would judge international agreements “not by how much is harmonized or by how many barriers are torn down but whether citizens are empowered.”
As Summers and others argue, globalization has brought large gains to the world economy as a whole, but seldom have the winners compensated the losers, directly or indirectly.
Moreover, lately the winners have often been much smaller in number than the losers, particularly in a given geographical area, or because of winner-take-all markets.
Finally, the economic policies preferred by the “winners” – and adopted under their influence – are usually far from beneficial for all.
All of this is correct.
Unfortunately, these arguments often lead political moderates to retreat under the pressure of nativism, aggressive nationalism, and incoherent economic slogans.
Those who shout or tweet one-liners and promote narrow identity politics have forced those who believe in a global human community, one bound together by shared interests, to fight a rearguard battle to articulate why the one-liners make little sense.
But this counterattack, if it can be called that, seems unable to formulate even two-liners capable of refuting populist tendentiousness.
There are of course decent economic analyses and sensible policy proposals that are being put forward by the moderate camp; but the debate is usually in the language – and body language – of technical experts, inciting yawns, not popular support.
There is an urgent need for a moderate, humanist, global, and “constructive” populism that can counter the extremists, not with complicated mathematical models of, say, the employment implications of Brexit, but with simple yet powerful ideas that resonate with millions.
Liberal democracies, when faced with dire challenges, have found such voices before.
Think of the rhetoric of Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s, or of the founding fathers of the European Community.
What makes “constructive” populism constructive is that it simplifies what is known with a reasonable degree of certainty.
By contrast, “destructive” populists consciously distort what is known and have no qualms fabricating what isn’t.
This kind of destructive populism is far less common at the local level, where debate focuses on concrete solutions to citizens’ real problems.
This does not mean that local politics is easy; witness today’s fraught relations between police and racial minorities in US cities.
But, as Bruce Katz and Luise Noring have documented, in many cities in America and around the world, elected officials, civic organizations, and private business often unite beyond party lines to design and find funding for innovative projects in public transport, housing, or economic development.
Where constructive populism is most needed is at the national and international level, because many problems cannot be addressed locally.
Consider foreign policy.
There is a strong trend in many countries toward the aggressive nationalism that has led to so many catastrophes in history, not least during the first half of the twentieth century.
Some dismiss the dangers of this nationalist resurgence, arguing that economic interdependence will protect us from our own atavistic urges.
But this was not the case in the past.
After all, the three disastrous decades that started in 1914 followed a period of rapid and deep globalization.
A political message embodying a commitment to constant vigilance in support of peace has again become essential.
But it must be made concrete.
In the world’s liberal democracies, such a message should emphasize three components: strong defense and intelligence capabilities; the legitimacy of negotiating with friends and foes alike to find common ground; and the understanding that lasting alliances and friendships will be built around shared democratic values and support for human rights.
Short-term commercial or other interests should not be permitted to undermine core matters of principle.
If human rights, including women’s rights, for example, are indeed a key element of democratic values, we can negotiate on all kinds of issues with those who suppress them; but as long as there is no progress on these rights, we cannot be true friends and at the same time claim to uphold universal human values.
Constructive populism cannot be cynical; it must be realistic, and it must recognize that progress may be gradual and take different forms in different places.
On economic policy, many reasonable disagreements rule out consensus.
But it can be argued in simple language that markets work for all only if they are regulated in the interests of all; that public expenditures that create productive assets can reduce the ratio of public debt to national income; and that performance should be measured by how widely the fruits of growth are shared.
The way to overcome identity politics and irresponsible populism is not to meet it in the middle or to fight it with detailed technical analysis.
The way to avoid disaster is constructive populism: simple, accurate, and always sincere.

Can Russia be Saved?
MOSCOW – Russia’s economy is collapsing, but the situation could be even worse.
The global economic crisis has finally forced the government to adopt sensible policies, thereby staving off disaster – at least for now.
Official forecasts for Russian GDP growth in 2009 remain positive, but most analysts, including government officials, are bracing for a severe recession – which, indeed, appears to have started in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The stock market’s collapse – its 72% fall is the largest of all major emerging markets – is only the most visible sign of this.
Even Russia’s oligarchs are pawning their yachts and selling their private jets.
Signs of political instability are mounting.
The approval ratings for Russia’s president and prime minister are heading south.
Mass street protests have started – not led by opposition political parties but by workers and middle-class families facing job losses and declining wages.
More importantly, protesters are demanding that the government resign –unthinkable just a year ago.
With oil prices plummeting 70% from their peak (and similar price declines for metals, Russia’s other major export), it is no surprise that Russia is facing severe economic challenges.
Growth is endangered, the ruble is weak, and the government budget is in deficit.
Nevertheless, up to now, Russia’s government and private sector have weathered the storm reasonably well.
Critics of Vladimir Putin’s regime argue that Russia’s political system is too centralized and risks collapse in today’s economic storm.
The regime’s ideology, after all, places the state and loyalty to the rulers ahead of private property and merit.
When the crisis hits with full force, the government would nationalize major banks and companies, with the resulting inefficiency then burying the Russian economy, just as it doomed the Soviet Union.
Russia’s government has, in fact, made serious mistakes in dealing with the crisis.
Taxpayers’ money was spent to purchase corporate stocks in a failed attempt to support collapsing stock prices.
The government is unlikely to recover its investment anytime soon.
The government was also too slow in depreciating the ruble.
While one can argue that one-off devaluation was risky – as it could have triggered a panic – gradual depreciation should have started earlier than it did.
In the last two months of 2008, the central bank allowed the ruble to weaken at a rate of 1% per week, then at 2-3% per week.
It probably still needs to fall another 10%.
In the meantime, the central bank hemorrhaged reserves defending this slow correction, while commercial banks have been holding on to dollars in anticipation of the ruble’s further decline.
The third mistake was to raise import duties, especially for imported cars.
This was not only economically foolish (as with many other import-competing sectors, the automotive industry will certainly be protected by the weakening ruble), but also politically dangerous.
Car owners are an affluent, socially active, and easily organized group.
Street protests against the import duties became the first serious popular uprising that Russia has seen in many years.
Yet these mistakes are relatively minor and reversible.
Indeed, Russia’s government, unexpectedly, has taken resolute and mostly correct economic decisions.
First, it prevented the collapse of the banking system.
Many Russian banks were heavily exposed in foreign markets, and therefore faced severe financial problems once the crisis hit.
A massive liquidity injection by the government ensured that no major bank collapsed, and minor bank failures were administered in a surprisingly orderly fashion.
Moreover, the crisis has – so far – not resulted in major nationalizations of private companies.
The government could have used the crisis to nationalize all banks and companies in financial distress.
It has not, despite its still awesome foreign reserves, which give it the wherewithal to buy out a significant portion of the economy at fire-sale prices.
Instead, up to now at least, the government has mostly been providing (high-interest) loans rather than engaging in massive equity buyouts.
Nor have the oligarchs been bailed out.
Of $50 billion in external debt owed by Russian banks and firms in 2008, the government refinanced only $10 billion.
Apparently, the terms offered by the government (LIBOR+5% and collateral) have turned out to be right on target.
How did reasonable economic policies prevail in this crisis?
The key factor is that, for the first time since Putin came to power, the Kremlin perceives a genuine threat.
The years of easy popularity are over.
All the ugly facts that Russians ignored during the years of fast economic growth are bubbling to the surface.
The regime knows that its survival depends on preventing economic collapse.
The crisis energized the system and shifted decision-making power to those who know about and can do something for the economy.
But did these policy changes come too late?
The ossified, corrupt, inefficient economy built in the fat years of the oil boom may be impossible to save.
So the central question that Russia confronts is whether even competent economic policy can prevent economic and political collapse.

Overcoming Market Obstacles to New Antibiotics
LONDON – From the strict perspective of some investors, astute financial management by a company to bolster its share price is a good thing.
By this narrow logic, when it comes to the pharmaceutical industry, we should be unconcerned if drug firms’ share prices are boosted not by new discoveries, but by financial maneuvers, such as share buybacks or tax inversion.
But the pharmaceutical industry is not an industry like any other.
It is intrinsically bound up with the public good, having historically provided the medical innovation that is essential to society’s ability to fight disease.
Furthermore, while patients are the consumers, the actual buyers are often governments.
Even in the United States, public purchasers account for at least 40% of the prescription drug market.
Governments also bankroll much of the research underlying the industry’s profits.
The US government is the world’s largest funder of medical research and development; globally, taxpayers finance a third of spending on health research.
So it should come as no surprise when policymakers insist that the industry’s efforts at innovation be channeled into areas that provide the most benefit to taxpayers and patients, rather than those – like financial maneuvers – that might be most profitable for the industry in the short term.
The pharmaceutical industry is at its best when private profitability and social good coincide, as it does when useful new drugs attract large market shares.
But, unfortunately, that is not always the case – and the results can be tragic.
In the field of antibiotics development, in particular, the divergence between profit-seeking behavior and the public good is taking the world to the brink of crisis.
When antibiotics first entered into common use in the 1940s, previously dangerous conditions, such as pneumonia or infected cuts, became benign conditions that could be treated easily.
Antibiotics underpin modern medicine; without them, surgery or chemotherapy become much riskier.
But antibiotics lose their effectiveness over time.
And whereas previous generations of scientists quickly found new substitutes, today, in many cases, doctors are down to their last line of defense.
For a range of infections – including strains of pneumonia, E. coli, and gonorrhea – there are no replacements in reserve.
One would think this would cause drug companies and their investors to compete to develop new antibiotics.
But much of the pharmaceutical industry has abandoned this pursuit.
Developing new antibiotics is difficult and expensive – and, crucially, far less profitable than investments in other important fields, such as cancer and diabetes.
Part of the problem is these drugs’ unique importance.
Companies are not always able to recoup their investments by setting a high price on patented antibiotics.
When a new antibiotic is discovered, public health authorities rightly want to keep it in reserve, insisting that it be used only when all other options have failed.
As a result, a new antibiotic may not become widely used until after its patent has expired and its inventors are forced to compete with generic manufacturers.
In January, the pharmaceutical industry took a big step toward solving this problem when more than 100 companies and trade associations from more than 20 countries signed a declaration calling on governments to adopt a new model of antibiotic development.
As part of this new model, the signatories committed themselves to provide access to new drugs for all those who need them, increase investment in R&D that meets global public health needs, and help slow the development of drug resistance in humans and animals.
Governments should encourage and enable the industry to meet these objectives.
One way would to be adopt a proposal I made last year and introduce rewards of $1 billion or more to those who develop the most-needed types of antibiotics.
Such an approach would balance commercial returns with affordability, global access, and conservation, while saving governments money in the long run.
Using this approach to restock the antibiotics pipeline would cost roughly $25 billion over ten years.
Shared among G-20 governments, this is very little money, and would be a remarkably good investment – especially given that antibiotic resistance currently costs the US health-care system alone about $20 billion per year.
Governments could introduce incentives for antibiotics R&D, paid for with their existing funding streams or new funding streams that are innovative and self-sustaining.
One option would be a small access-to-market fee that could be collected by pharmaceutical regulators in large markets.
This system recognizes that antibiotics are a shared and exhaustible resource on which the viability of a range of other pharmaceutical products and medical devices – from chemotherapy to joint replacements – depends.
It is comparable to approaches in sectors such as energy, water, or fisheries, where regulatory tools are used to ensure that shared resources and infrastructure are managed and replenished in the interests of both consumers and the producers whose businesses rely on them.
The necessary $2.5 billion per year would amount to just 0.25% of global pharmaceutical sales – hardly a strain on an industry that is, by and large, in sound financial health.
And the scheme would be particularly attractive if it could be implemented on a pay-or-play basis, whereby companies could choose whether to invest in R&D or to contribute to a fund rewarding those whose efforts result in the desired drugs.
It is time to turn ideas into effective action and solve the problem of drug resistance.
To do that, companies and governments must recognize that antibiotics are not a commodity like any other.

Time to Bring Mahatma Gandhi Back
NEW YORK – The Congress Party’s unexpected landslide in India’s general election was greeted with euphoria.
Many believe that Congress – with its commitment to secular values, economic growth, and helping the poor – now has a mandate to transform India into a great power.
Business and financial interests, in particular, are delighted with the outcome, crowing about the bonanza about to be unleashed as Congress liberalizes India’s economy further.
The Americans are happy that India’s pesky left, reduced to a paltry 24 seats, has been all but eliminated from national government.
India’s Communists had tried to topple the Congress-led government last year in an attempt to scuttle the nuclear deal brokered by the United States, and had vowed to upend it.
As for the threat from the right, anyone hoping for peace in the region and reduced tensions within India between religious communities is relieved by the defeat of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The BJP’s strategy of painting the Congress as soft on terror and demonizing Muslims as an existential threat to India badly misfired.
Unfortunately, however, the economic trajectory that Congress is plotting, though it may well boost growth in the short term, is ultimately on a collision course with both equity and sustainability.
Despite rhetoric about “inclusive growth,” India’s wealth gap has widened during the years of exceptionally rapid economic expansion.
The majority of the world’s malnourished children live in India.
While private wealth management is a growth industry among India’s 200,000 or so nouveaux riches , 800 million Indians live on less than $2 per day.
India’s water supply is stretched to the limit, even as global warming is fast melting the Himalayan glaciers on which millions depend for water.
Moreover, climate change threatens to reduce agricultural output by up to 40% by 2080, when India will have another 450 million people.
At that point, the consultancy McKinsey & Company projects India’s middle-class consumer market will have hit 600 million people, twice the size of the current US population.
That’s exciting news to retailers looking for new markets. But what about India’s other billion people?
And where will the resources come from to manufacture all the stuff these new consumers will buy?
The die was cast for India’s development path on July 22, 1947, when India’s Constituent Assembly resolved to replace Mahatma Gandhi’s spinning wheel, or charka , with the emperor Ashoka’s wheel of dharma on the Indian national flag.
The move symbolically rejected what the incoming government abandoned upon assuming office: Gandhi’s vision of an equitable and sustainable agrarian society based on self-sufficient, pared-down consumption.
For Gandhi, the spinning wheel symbolized the need to assume personal responsibility for consumption as a first step toward achieving justice and freedom for all.
But Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, believed in industrialization and urbanization, famously calling the new mega-dam projects his government underwrote the “temples of modern India.”
In his famous speech on India’s “tryst with destiny,” Nehru promised Indians that his government would seek to “bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the peasants and workers of India; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease;… to ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman.”
For 63 years, the vast majority of India’s people have waited for this promise to be fulfilled.
As Congress retakes power, it is Rahul Gandhi, the 39-year-old great-grandson of the man who made that promise, who is the heir-apparent to current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Observers expect the young Gandhi to become prime minister within two years.
The essential challenge before him and his country is not transitioning from a more to a less state-directed economic system, as many of those cheering Congress’s electoral victory believe.
While bureaucratic excess, entrenched corruption, and other inefficiencies beg remedy, the real challenge before India is its allegiance to a twentieth-century vision of modernity.
Former Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has said that his dream is to see 85% of Indians living in cities and only 15%, as opposed to the current 60%, engaged in agriculture, because to be an agrarian society in the modern era is to be poor and powerless. To be “developed” means to be industrialized and urbanized.
But, for better or worse, we are no longer in the modern era.
The post-modern realities of our grave present make a mockery of modernity.
When asked what he thought about Western civilization, Gandhi famously replied, “It would be a good idea.” He also said that “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need, but not every man’s greed.”
For Gandhi, greed led to violence, violence to militarism, militarism to war, and war to annihilation.
His philosophy of non-violence was aimed at the most basic form of human aggression: the appetite for more than one’s share.
India’s essential challenge is to take up Gandhi’s mantle and boldly imagine a future that is different from the West’s present.
Of course, no one is under the illusion that India or any other country will abandon its cities for a life as simple as the one Gandhi strove to live; but that doesn’t mean that India can’t look to Gandhi’s core values for inspiration.
Rahul Gandhi bears the name, if not the lineage, of the Mahatma (to whom he is not related).
If India is lucky, when he assumes leadership of the Congress Party he will let himself be as inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s vision for India as by that of his great-grandfather.
After all, it was out of their complicated marriage of ideas that independent India was born.
Nehru’s vision has had a good run; now it is time to bring back Gandhi’s.

Qatar’s Human-Rights Reversal
BEIRUT – It should go without saying that a policy reform should be for the better – or, at least, not for the worse.
But recent labor reforms in the Gulf fail to clear even this very low bar.
In a region where foreign domestic workers are already highly vulnerable, they are now increasingly being denied basic rights.
Like other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, as well as Jordan and Lebanon, Qatar has in place a kafala system of labor sponsorship, under which a worker’s kafeel (sponsor) controls their immigration status, wages, accommodation, and all other contract terms.
This system has often been criticized for leaving migrant workers – especially low-income women – highly vulnerable, with condemnation growing after Qatar was awarded the right to host this year’s FIFA World Cup tournament.
So, Qatar’s pledge in 2017 that it would pursue sweeping labor reforms was welcome news.
And many celebrated when, in August 2020, Qatar removed the requirement that workers obtain their kafeel’s approval to change employers.
Despite concerns that the lack of visibility of some workers, especially domestic workers, would undermine enforcement, many hoped that this augured a broader strengthening of protections for migrant workers, not only in Qatar, but across the GCC.
Those hopes were dealt a serious blow last July, when Qatar’s government extended the probationary period for domestic workers – during which the kafeel can get a full refund from the recruitment agency – from three months to nine.
The idea apparently was that the increased risk of financial losses would spur recruitment agencies to expand their monitoring of workers’ circumstances.
But how could they?
The household is considered “sacred,” and interference in its affairs is prohibited, so inspections are not allowed.
The Ministry of Labor’s explanation is that this change promotes stability for employers.
In reality, it merely puts domestic workers at increased risk of abuse.
This policy already facilitates exploitation of workers.
Even beyond the probationary period, employers can receive a refund if the worker has a chronic illness, refuses to work, or “absconds.”
So, sponsors may falsely accuse workers of these “crimes,” knowing that workers have little power to contest the charges.
The mere threat that a sponsor will level such accusations against a worker can have a powerful coercive effect.
But workers are never more vulnerable than during their probationary period.
For starters, if workers are moved before their probation ends, they cannot access end-of-service benefits.
Moreover, far from protecting workers from exploitation, recruitment agencies might punish them for being “returned.”
The International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) regularly receives complaints about recruitment agencies confiscating mobile phones, providing insufficient food, and withholding salaries until a new employment contract is signed.
Agency staff might also harass workers, physically and verbally.
With an extended probationary period leading to larger financial losses, there is good reason to fear an increase in such abuses at the hands of recruitment agencies.
This is even more likely, given endemic impunity for such violations.
Though the IDWF has filed complaints with the Ministry of Labor, which has, at times, sent inspectors to check conditions at recruitment agencies, violations of workers’ rights are usually ignored, and rarely punished.
The flawed reform is merely a symptom of a deeper problem: the exclusion of key stakeholders.
Because the new rule technically applies to recruitment agencies, only they were involved in discussions with government officials.
Domestic workers were excluded, even though they are clearly the primary stakeholders, just as they would be in any policy regarding employers’ rights or obligations.
The fact that the reform does not affect the Domestic Workers Law is irrelevant.
Without the active involvement of workers and the organizations committed to protecting them, no positive labor reforms can be achieved.
In the past, Qatar’s labor ministry prided itself on its collaborative approach, which included consultations with stakeholders prior to the release of any official decree.
This time around, domestic- and migrant-worker organizations found out about the change only after it was announced publicly.
Moreover, in February 2022, the ministry provided an initial copy of this policy, but to this day, it has not addressed the questions or concerns raised by stakeholders, and a review has yet to take place.
This is no oversight.
It amounts to a deliberate effort to obscure the rollback of vulnerable workers’ rights.
And the World Cup has not even started yet.

Donald Trump’s North Korean Family Values
ATLANTA – With every new US president arriving in Washington, DC, come a handful of counselors and aides whose personal ties, built over years and forged in election campaigns, give them pride of place in the administration.
From the “Irish Brotherhood” that brought John F. Kennedy to office to the “Berlin Wall” that guarded Richard Nixon’s door, close friends and confidantes have often outdone the administration’s biggest names.
But no American president has ever brought to the White House an inner circle dominated by his family – until Donald Trump.
Judging by Trump’s business history and presidential campaign – which featured few, if any, intimates outside his family – his adult children will have a major hand in his administration’s decisions, despite their lack of experience in international and domestic affairs.
After hiring and firing personnel and shaping strategy during the election campaign, Trump’s children have remained front and center in his transition team.
His daughter, Ivanka, joined the president-elect’s tête-à-tête with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
His son, Donald, Jr., played a role in picking Congressman Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the Interior in the new administration.
Now, Trump is taking his dynasty to the White House.
Ivanka is set to take over the First Lady’s office there.
Her husband, the real-estate investor Jared Kushner, just might be suited, if only in the eyes of his father-in-law, to serve as a special envoy to broker peace in the Middle East.
Yes, Donald, Jr. and his brother, Eric, will remain in New York to run the Trump Organization, which oversees their father’s diverse businesses; but Trump’s claim that his sons will remain at arm’s length strains credulity.
All of this has spurred questions about the Trump children’s capacity to leverage their father’s presidency to benefit the family business, with many fixating on whether Trump is violating conflict-of-interest or anti-nepotism rules.
But Trump regards such questions as essentially moot.
That is not surprising.
Trump’s management model has long been underpinned by a hereditary inner circle.
His adult children have spent their lives being groomed and promoted, and have operated at the pinnacle of the Trump Organization for years.
They now occupy three of the company’s board seats, with Trump occupying a fourth.
Given their standing in the company, and their relationship with their father, their influence in his administration should not be in doubt.
The remaining top-level positions are filled by long-time family retainers who, on average, have 17 years on the job.
Several have spent three decades at Trump’s elbow.
Compared to public companies of comparable size, the Trump Organization’s dynastic C-Suite and the longevity of its consiglieri are striking.
The lesson for any administration appointee should be clear: only loyalty comes close to heredity in winning and holding an executive role.
The record of the modern US presidency sheds little light on whether Trump’s family-driven leadership style will work.
Yet Trump is unlikely to weigh the pros and cons of stacking his inner circle with family members, not least because of his own experience: ever since his father brought him into the family business, he has never worked anywhere else.
Moreover, Trump is far from the only corporate boss who prefers to keep leadership “all in the family.”
A 2016 study by the Boston Consulting Group found that one-third of American companies with annual revenue of $1 billion or more are family-owned.
Of those, 40% are family-run.
There is also plenty of precedent for family-based leadership in government, though not in developed democracies.
From Kazakhstan to Congo, blood binds together ruling elites who share the spoils, guard against usurpers, and ensure that their children succeed them in power.
While it may seem far-fetched to compare the Trumps to, say, the Kims of North Korea – the world’s longest-running family dictatorship – plenty of similarities are likely to emerge.
Some already have.
The first rule of family dictatorships is that loyalty matters above all else.
Like the histrionic pledges of support required from North Korean commissars and generals for their leader Kim Jong-un, the Trump White House is likely to demand unswerving fealty to the clan.
That message has already been received loud and clear by incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.
Both have repeatedly affirmed their admiration for Kushner and vowed that he will be deeply involved in decisions, despite his utter lack of experience.
Second, tasks beat titles.
Like Kim, who has ignored the pecking order of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea to give his sister and brother high-ranking positions, Trump is likely to entrust his offspring with key assignments.
While nepotism laws will probably rule out official presidential appointments for Trump’s children and their spouses, that won’t matter much in practice; their de facto clout, as well as Trump’s own priorities, will quickly become apparent.
Indeed, their influence in advancing Trump’s major goals could easily overwhelm that of cabinet-level appointees, who would be wise to accommodate them.
Third, there will be unexpected promotions and abrupt purges.
In North Korea, all of this dictated from the top.
In his reality television persona, Trump’s enthusiastic firings and occasional Cinderella-like promotions of low-level employees provide an obvious parallel.
Under Trump, as under Kim, sputtering or failed policies are likely to have personnel consequences, though only those outside the family will face them.
Two weeks before the election, one of the Trump campaign’s top employees, Brad Parscale, suggested how a Trump White House would function. “My loyalty is to the family,” Parscale said.
No one in Kim’s family could put it more succinctly.

France’s Anti-Populist Populist
WARSAW – Democrats of all stripes have been celebrating the prospect that the pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron – not the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen – will be France’s next president.
But while Macron’s victory is good news, it does not augur the defeat of populism in Europe.
On the contrary, Macron represents a kind of “enlightened populism” that comes with its own set of problems.
Macron’s candidacy, like Le Pen’s, was a rebuke to France’s mainstream political parties.
He persuaded voters with his promise of a Scandinavian-style combination of economic liberalism and a flexible welfare state.
But it may be time to concede that Scandinavia is unique, and programs that succeed there may not be replicable elsewhere.
Nonetheless, Macron’s populism may not be altogether a bad thing in the short term.
Perhaps, in France and elsewhere nowadays, only a populist can beat a populist.
If so, Macron’s enlightened populism certainly is preferable to the nationalist populism that Le Pen espouses.
The question is whether enlightened populism can play a role in steering political systems away from populism altogether – and toward real solutions to their countries’ problems.
The only true antidote to populism – the only real way to resolve the problems that ordinary people are facing – is greater political globalization.
After all, it is economic globalization without political globalization that produces nationalism.
Populists promise to halt economic globalization; in reality, they can stop (or reverse) only political globalization.
So the rise of populists to power creates a self-reinforcing dynamic, in which nationalism becomes increasingly salient.
Yet, as Macron proves, not all populism need be nationalist.
Historically, left-wing populism has been more common than its right-wing variant, the strength of which in the West nowadays reflects the perception, in the eyes of many citizens, that the left has become elitist.
There is, therefore, a case to be made that populism can be taken back from the nationalists and used to advance European integration and political globalization.
But, despite widespread enthusiasm about Macron’s victory, most of us remain subconscious fatalists on the matter of political globalization.
Who today believes in global democracy, or even in the United States of Europe?
Long before the current wave of nationalist populism, Europeans rejected a cautious European constitution.
Compared to this earlier ambition, even the most daring of Macron’s proposals for eurozone integration is in fact a minor revision.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, after congratulating Macron, made clear that she will consider no fiscal-policy changes – a stance that precludes a common eurozone treasury.
Past experience with enlightened populism reinforces this somewhat bleak perspective.
Enlightened populism’s founding father was Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who is now President of the European Council.
Before he became Poland’s prime minister, Tusk, like Macron, left a mainstream party to establish his own popular movement, Civic Platform.
And, like Macron’s En Marche !, that movement emphasized youth, optimism, and the promise of harnessing people’s talents and energies.
As prime minister, Tusk would respond to questions about his political vision by quipping that anyone who experienced visions should go see a doctor.
He selected people from both the left and the right to staff his government (an approach reflected in Macron’s claim that his brand of politics transcends the left-right divide).
Tusk assembled a kaleidoscope of views and people, and he shook the kaleidoscope whenever there was a need for a new perspective.
But Tusk, like Macron, faced a formidable challenge from nationalist populism, which in Poland came in the form of the Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by the late Lech Kaczyński and his twin brother Jarosław, who today is Poland’s de facto leader.
Even after Tusk came to power, it was the Kaczyńskis who shaped the agenda and tone of Polish political debate.
With Tusk forced to remain on the defensive, Polish politics came to consist of the PiS and the anti-PiS.
Macron may find himself in a similar situation, characterized by three key risks.
First, Le Pen – who, in her concession speech, called on “patriots” to commit to “the decisive battle that lies ahead” – may continue to set the tone of the political debate.
In that case, Macron could be forced to concentrate on managing a cordon sanitaire comprising those whose perspectives converge only on one issue: opposition to Le Pen.
Second, the pressure to stop Le Pen could compel Macron to abandon bold reforms, rather than risk driving away more voters than he can afford to lose and opening the way for Le Pen and the National Front to strengthen their position.
In Poland, reforms were realized despite politics, not thanks to politics.
Rather than implementing an ambitious agenda, Tusk’s policy amounted to “keeping warm water in the taps.” Macron could end up doing the same.
Third, Macron could inadvertently help to bring the National Front to power.
The existing political division between right and wrong, rather than between right and left, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Even the best politician is bound to make a mistake at some point, or simply to bore the electorate.
If Le Pen remains Macron’s primary opponent, it is only a matter of time before she will reach for power as Kaczyński did, and ruin her country.
Macron is thus both the bulwark against Le Pen and the guarantor of her success.
Only a proper division into left and right can guarantee the survival of liberal democracy, as it gives voters multiple safe choices.
But the elements of such a structure are possible only within a political community that enjoys economic sovereignty, and that will not be possible until we have political globalization.
And everything comes full circle.
To discern whether we are seeing the high tide or ebb tide of populism in Europe, the results of individual elections mean little.
The focus must remain on the structural factors – above all, economic globalization in the absence of political globalization – underpinning the rise of populism.
And in this regard, nothing has changed.

Emerging Markets’ Feminine Future
LONDON – According to the United Nations, 70% of women worldwide experience violence in their lifetime.
The World Bank adds that women aged 15-44 are more likely to experience rape or domestic violence than cancer, car accidents, war, or malaria.
Such indicators are even more alarming in emerging markets, where discrimination and gender inequality are particularly prevalent.
This partly reflects the failure of public policy to ameliorate the distributive consequences of rapid economic growth.
With the informal sector continuing to play a major role in emerging economies, women often have access to only unreliable and transitory employment that offers casual and irregular wages.
Meanwhile, unprecedented urbanization has disrupted traditional family structures, further undermining the role that women can play in economies and societies.
The damaging impact of active gender discrimination – such as bride burning and female infanticide – is clear.
But passive discrimination – tolerating rules and institutions that deny women equal say in reproductive decisions, equal access to education and employment, equal pay for equal work, equal rights before the law, and equal political influence – is similarly destructive.
In all of its forms, gender discrimination makes women vulnerable to sexual slavery, trafficking, and forced marriage, deprives women of their inalienable rights, and diminishes their quality of life.
At the same time, it stunts the capacity of boys and men to understand women’s plight, thus diminishing their motivation to change the situation.
While these issues are global, they are most urgent in emerging markets, where they are undermining the social and economic progress on which the rest of the world increasingly relies.
In the wake of the global economic crisis, emerging markets have become the engines of worldwide growth.
But these countries face growing constraints to sustainability, social cohesion, and political stability, including erosion of their international competitiveness, environmental degradation, weaknesses (including corruption) in national, local, and corporate governance, wasted human capital, and growing social, economic, and gender inequality.
Failure to make full use of women’s talents undermines emerging markets’ economic development, while the marginalization and abuse of women threatens their social advancement and impairs their political stability.
With most countries worldwide facing continued economic uncertainty, the international community has a vested interest in emerging economies’ resilience, collective capacity to sustain global demand for goods and services, and ability to confront the challenges, such as gender inequality, that threaten their success.
The importance of overcoming these barriers to development was emphasized at a recent symposium (of which I was the chair) at Green Templeton College, Oxford.
Fifty leaders from government, business, civil society, and academia identified gender inequality as the most urgent constraint to sustainable growth, social cohesion, and political stability, and agreed on the steps needed to address the issue effectively.
First and foremost, national policymakers must take concrete, comprehensive action to ensure that women are forced to abandon neither productive nor reproductive activities.
To this end, governments should implement measures that guarantee, directly or indirectly, affordable child- and elder-care support systems for working parents.
Moreover, private employers should be encouraged to build supportive workplaces by implementing creative solutions to common constraints.
For example, MAS Holdings in Sri Lanka has incorporated into the workplace nursing stations, on-site banking, and company buses that ease employees’ commutes and facilitate participation in sports programs.
Such measures not only lead to increased productivity; they also bolster loyalty, morale, and thus employee retention.
At the same time, it is crucial that women enjoy total reproductive autonomy and sexual sovereignty.
This can be achieved only with the provision of universal and unfettered access to reproductive and other relevant health-care services.
But even healthy reproduction has a dark side.
Neonaticide (killing infants that are less than one day old), infanticide (killing infants that are more than one day old), and the practice of disposing of female children in favor of male offspring are not only barbaric; they have led to imbalanced gender ratios in many emerging markets.
Policymakers must enforce criminal sanctions against these practices.
Subsequently, educational programs for children and adults should be launched, in collaboration with religious groups, in order to improve public understanding of gender inequality.
By promoting a shift in public perceptions, such programs can catalyze fundamental behavioral changes.
International action is also crucial.
The World Bank and regional development banks should be encouraged to incorporate gender-equality criteria into their eligibility criteria for loans and credit to emerging-market governments and private-sector corporations.
Such a clear economic link would help to motivate local policymakers to take strong action, while helping to bolster public support for policies promoting gender equality.
The international community has a profound stake in the future performance of emerging markets.
In order to bolster these countries’ social and economic advancement, the development agenda in the coming years should include a robust commitment to promoting gender equality.

The Stagflationary Debt Crisis Is Here
NEW YORK – For a year now, I have argued that the increase in inflation would be persistent, that its causes include not only bad policies but also negative supply shocks, and that central banks’ attempt to fight it would cause a hard economic landing.
When the recession comes, I warned, it will be severe and protracted, with widespread financial distress and debt crises.
Notwithstanding their hawkish talk, central bankers, caught in a debt trap, may still wimp out and settle for above-target inflation.
Any portfolio of risky equities and less risky fixed-income bonds will lose money on the bonds, owing to higher inflation and inflation expectations.
How do these predictions stack up?
First, Team Transitory clearly lost to Team Persistent in the inflation debate.
On top of excessively loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies, negative supply shocks caused price growth to surge.
COVID-19 lockdowns led to supply bottlenecks, including for labor.
China’s “zero-COVID” policy created even more problems for global supply chains.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through energy and other commodity markets.
And the broader sanctions regime – not least the weaponization of the US dollar and other currencies – has further balkanized the global economy, with “friend-shoring” and trade and immigration restrictions accelerating the trend toward deglobalization.
Everyone now recognizes that these persistent negative supply shocks have contributed to inflation, and the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the US Federal Reserve have begun to acknowledge that a soft landing will be exceedingly difficult to pull off.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell now speaks of a “softish landing” with at least “some pain.”
Meanwhile, a hard-landing scenario is becoming the consensus among market analysts, economists, and investors.
It is much harder to achieve a soft landing under conditions of stagflationary negative supply shocks than it is when the economy is overheating because of excessive demand.
Since World War II, there has never been a case where the Fed achieved a soft landing with inflation above 5% (it is currently above 8%) and unemployment below 5% (it is currently 3.7%).
And if a hard landing is the baseline for the United States, it is even more likely in Europe, owing to the Russian energy shock, China’s slowdown, and the ECB falling even further behind the curve relative to the Fed.
Are we already in a recession?
Not yet, but the US did report negative growth in the first half of the year, and most forward-looking indicators of economic activity in advanced economies point to a sharp slowdown that will grow even worse with monetary-policy tightening.
A hard landing by year’s end should be regarded as the baseline scenario.
While many other analysts now agree, they seem to think that the coming recession will be short and shallow, whereas I have cautioned against such relative optimism, stressing the risk of a severe and protracted stagflationary debt crisis.
And now, the latest distress in financial markets – including bond and credit markets – has reinforced my view that central banks’ efforts to bring inflation back down to target will cause both an economic and a financial crash.
I have also long argued that central banks, regardless of their tough talk, will feel immense pressure to reverse their tightening once the scenario of a hard economic landing and a financial crash materializes.
Early signs of wimping out are already discernible in the United Kingdom.
Faced with the market reaction to the new government’s reckless fiscal stimulus, the BOE has launched an emergency quantitative-easing (QE) program to buy up government bonds (the yields on which have spiked).
Monetary policy is increasingly subject to fiscal capture.
Recall that a similar turnaround occurred in the first quarter of 2019, when the Fed stopped its quantitative-tightening (QT) program and started pursuing a mix of backdoor QE and policy-rate cuts – after previously signaling continued rate hikes and QT – at the first sign of mild financial pressures and a growth slowdown.
Central banks will talk tough; but there is good reason to doubt their willingness to do “whatever it takes” to return inflation to its target rate in a world of excessive debt with risks of an economic and financial crash.
Moreover, there are early signs that the Great Moderation has given way to the Great Stagflation, which will be characterized by instability and a confluence of slow-motion negative supply shocks.
In addition to the disruptions mentioned above, these shocks could include societal aging in many key economies (a problem made worse by immigration restrictions); Sino-American decoupling; a “geopolitical depression” and breakdown of multilateralism; new variants of COVID-19 and new outbreaks, such as monkeypox; the increasingly damaging consequences of climate change; cyberwarfare; and fiscal policies to boost wages and workers’ power.
Where does that leave the traditional 60/40 portfolio?
I previously argued that the negative correlation between bond and equity prices would break down as inflation rises, and indeed it has.
Between January and June of this year, US (and global) equity indices fell by over 20% while long-term bond yields rose from 1.5% to 3.5%, leading to massive losses on both equities and bonds (positive price correlation).
Moreover, bond yields fell during the market rally between July and mid-August (which I correctly predicted would be a dead-cat bounce), thus maintaining the positive price correlation; and since mid-August, equities have continued their sharp fall while bond yields have gone much higher.
As higher inflation has led to tighter monetary policy, a balanced bear market for both equities and bonds has emerged.
But US and global equities have not yet fully priced in even a mild and short hard landing.
Equities will fall by about 30% in a mild recession, and by 40% or more in the severe stagflationary debt crisis that I have predicted for the global economy.
Signs of strain in debt markets are mounting: sovereign spreads and long-term bond rates are rising, and high-yield spreads are increasing sharply; leveraged-loan and collateralized-loan-obligation markets are shutting down; highly indebted firms, shadow banks, households, governments, and countries are entering debt distress.
The crisis is here.

Waiting for Germany
BERLIN – More than a decade after the 2008 financial crisis, the European Union is still stagnating politically.
But the EU must be strengthened if the project of European integration is to succeed.
Otherwise, the forces of the new nationalism will continue their assault on democracy, the rule of law, and the bloc’s other defining values.
The main reason that Europe remains at an impasse is Germany.
For years after 2008, when the EU was confronting slow growth and mounting economic crises, Germany insisted that it could not move the European project forward alone, and that it would have to wait for France.
Then, in the spring of 2017, Emmanuel Macron was elected to the French presidency on the promise that he would push for EU-level reforms and modernize the French economy.
But just when France was coming back on board, Germany was approaching its September 2017 general election, which resulted in significant losses for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and led to a months-long effort to form a new government.
In the same month that Germany voted, Macron delivered an impressive speech at the Sorbonne, in which he proposed specific reforms to stabilize the eurozone, create a common border-protection system, and establish a joint European defense initiative.
At the time, Macron’s proposals received an icy response in Germany; seven months later, Germany still hasn’t offered any of its own.
Instead, Germany has remained silent on the question of Europe’s future, and has indicated that its primary concern is its own money.
The bean counters in the Bundestag’s budget committee, it seems, have hijacked Germany’s European policy.
In the past, that policy was spearheaded by chancellors who understood the historic significance of European integration.
Yet today, Merkel seems to have allowed the CDU’s backbenchers – and those of its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) – to shackle her in the lead-up to any negotiations over EU-level reforms.
Squandering the opportunity offered by Macron – which will not come again – would be the height of political folly and historical blindness.
The transatlantic system’s two founding powers are in the process of bidding that system goodbye.
The United Kingdom has opted to leave the EU, effective next spring.
And the United States under President Donald Trump has questioned its transatlantic security guarantee and now is undermining the global trade system upon which Europe – and particularly Germany – has relied since the 1950s.
The threat of a Western denouement is shaking the economic and security pillars of European stability.
China has emerged as a global power capable of pulling the world economy’s center of gravity away from the Atlantic and toward the Asia-Pacific region.
Europeans now face the prospect of being left behind by both the US and China, not only geopolitically, but also in the key economic sector of the twenty-first century: artificial intelligence.
Europe also faces more immediate threats closer to home.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is once again testing Eastern Europe’s borders by military means.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is taking his country further away from NATO and the West, while abandoning democracy and the rule of law.
And the entire Middle East could slide into a prolonged crisis, fueling more migration to Europe.
The war in Syria shows just how weak Europe has become.
Other than serving as a destination for refugees, the EU has become irrelevant in Syria.
Worse still, those formulating Germany’s foreign policy seem to believe that there is no military solution there, and that only Russia can bring an end to the war.
This argument overlooks the fact that a military solution is now within Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s grasp, thanks to the support he has received from Russia and Iran.
It also overlooks the fact that Russia is in no position to stop the larger regional conflict, even if it wanted to.
After all, Iran is not simply going to give up its land bridge to the Mediterranean Sea, and Israel is not going to accept the presence of Iranian Revolutionary Guards and missiles in Syria.
In fact, the risk of a conflict between Israel and Iran in Syria and Lebanon now looms large.
These developments pose new challenges for Europe.
On one hand, the EU needs to forestall a nuclear arms race in the region, not least by protecting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump is now threatening to kill.
On the other hand, the EU has an association agreement with – and historical responsibilities toward – Israel, so it cannot remain neutral or turn a blind eye to Iran’s hegemonic ambitions in the region.
With the exception of France and the UK (for now), the EU and its member states are decidedly unprepared for these risks.
And that applies particularly to Germany, where the military has languished under years of austerity.
The post-war US security guarantee allowed Germany to take a long break from thinking about strategic threats.
But now that Trump has called into question America’s commitments to its allies, Germany can no longer count on such a favorable division of labor.
In financial matters, Germany regularly accuses other eurozone countries of not sticking to the rules and adhering to agreed austerity policies.
In security matters, however, these accusations are coming back to haunt it.
The era of free-riding is ending, and without the US, Germany’s only other source of defense is a stronger Europe, which certainly can’t be had for free.
Nobody expects Germany to adopt Macron’s proposals wholesale.
But at a time when the foundations of the global order are shifting at Europe’s expense, marginal reforms will not suffice, and Germany has neither set out its own vision of a stronger Europe, nor shown a willingness to take action and make the necessary investments.
Europe and the West need a Franco-German response equal to that once provided by François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, and by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer before them.
And they need it now.
History will not stand still.

The Arab Revolutions’ Reality Check
BERLIN – Two years after popular uprisings began to convulse the Middle East, few people speak of an “Arab Spring” anymore.
Given Syria’s bloody civil war, the rise to power of Islamist forces through free elections, the ever-deepening political and economic crises in Egypt and Tunisia, increasing instability in Iraq, uncertainty about the future of Jordan and Lebanon, and the threat of war over Iran’s nuclear program, the bright hope of a new Middle East has vanished.
Add the region’s eastern and western peripheries – Afghanistan and North Africa (including the Sahel and South Sudan) – and the picture becomes even grimmer.
Indeed, Libya is increasingly unstable, al-Qaeda is actively engaged in the Sahel (as the fighting in Mali shows), and no one can foresee what will happen in Afghanistan after the US and its NATO allies withdraw in 2014.
All of us tend to make the same mistake repeatedly: we think at the beginning of a revolution that freedom and justice have prevailed over dictatorship and cruelty.
But history teaches us that what follows is usually nothing good.
A revolution not only overthrows a repressive regime; it also destroys the old order, paving the way for a mostly brutal, if not bloody, fight for power to establish a new one – a process that affects foreign and domestic policy alike.
Normally, revolutions are followed by dangerous times.
Indeed, exceptions to this pattern are rare: South Africa is one, owing to the genius of one of the century’s most outstanding statesmen, Nelson Mandela.
The alternative option can be observed in Zimbabwe.
Central and Eastern Europe after 1989, though a very interesting reference point for analysts of the Arab revolutions, is not an appropriate reference point, because the region’s new domestic and foreign order resulted from the change in external conditions stemming from the collapse of Soviet power.
Internally, nearly all of these countries had a very clear idea about what they wanted: democracy, freedom, a market economy, and protection from the return of the Russian empire.
They wanted the West, and their accession to NATO and the European Union was logical.
Nothing of the sort applies to the crisis belt of the Middle East.
No power anywhere, within the region or without, is willing and able to implement the barest vision of a new regional order – or even a vision for parts of it.
Chaos is a constant threat, with all of its accompanying risks and threats to world peace.
In addition to poverty, backwardness, repression, rapid population growth, religious and ethnic hatred, and stateless peoples (such as the Kurds and the Palestinians), the region has unstable borders.
Many were drawn by the colonial powers, Great Britain and France, after World War I, and most, with the exception of Iran’s and Egypt’s, have little legitimacy.
As if this were not enough, some countries – including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and even tiny (but very rich) Qatar – have ambitions to be regional powers.
All of this worsens an already tense situation.
All of these contradictions are currently exploding in Syria, whose population is suffering a humanitarian catastrophe, while the world stands by, up to now unwilling to intervene.
(If chemical weapons are deployed, intervention will become inevitable.)
Although intervention would be temporary and technically limited, everyone seems to be avoiding it, because the stakes are very high: not only a devastating civil war and massive human suffering, but also a new order for the whole of the Middle East.
Any military intervention would entail a confrontation not only with the Syrian military (supported by Russia and China), but also with Shia Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah.
Moreover, no one can guarantee that intervention would not quickly lead to another war with Israel.
The dangers of both action and inaction are very high.
The most likely outcome in Syria is that the human catastrophe will continue until President Bashar al-Assad’s regime collapses, after which the country very likely could be divided along ethnic and religious lines.
And Syria’s disintegration could further balkanize the Middle East, potentially unleashing new violence.
Frontline states like Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan will not manage to remain aloof from a disintegrating Syria.
What will happen with Syria’s Kurds and Palestinians, or its Christians, Druze, and smaller Muslim minorities?
And what about the Alawites (the backbone of Assad’s regime), who could face a terrible destiny, regardless of whether the country splits up?
Unanswered questions abound.
Of course, even in the face of this misery, we should not lose hope in agreements reached by diplomatic means; but, realistically, the chances are dwindling every day.
The whole of the Middle East is in motion, and a new and stable order will take a long time to establish.
Until then, the region will remain very dangerous, not only internally, but also for its neighbors (including Europe) and the world.

What’s Wrong with Ethnic Profiling?
BRUSSELS – Several years ago, as terrorism, immigration, and unrest in suburban Paris were at the top of the news in France, a French police officer confided to a researcher: “If you consider different levels of trafficking, it is obviously done by blacks and Arabs.
If you are on the road and see a black man or a man with Arabic features, you say to yourself, ‘He doesn’t look French,’ and then you might stop him to see if he has papers.”
This police officer was describing a textbook example of “ethnic profiling”: law enforcement officials use of stereotypes, rather than specific information about behavior, in deciding to stop, search, or detain people.
Ethnic profiling is illegal in Europe.
It is ineffective in apprehending criminals.
It is counter-productive in the campaign against terrorism.
But police officers across Europe continue to use it.
The inefficiency of ethnic profiling was highlighted in early May, when the British government released figures showing that, of the more than 117,000 police stops made between 2007 and 2008, only 72 led to an arrest for terrorism-related offences.
Other major European countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets’ ethnic or religious background. But private research and anecdotal reports provide a frighteningly similar picture.
A massive data-mining exercise in Germany from 2001 to 2003 trawled through personal information on 8.3 million people and failed to find a single terrorist.
Stops and searches conducted under counter-terrorism powers in Europe have produced few terrorism charges and no convictions.
Separate studies in Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States have concluded that ethnic profiling wastes time and resources.
As a new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative shows, by targeting ethnic minorities, police alienate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence.
And by pre-selecting fixed categories of people for heightened scrutiny, the authorities overlook those who do not fit the profile.
A young Spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way: “I worry when I go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin, by my tone of skin, by my way of walking.”
Given its failings, why is ethnic profiling so widespread?
The answer is simple.
When the police use ethnic profiling, they project an image of being tough on crime and terrorism. This appeases public opinion, which demands robust anti-terrorism action.
Following the September 2001 attacks in New York, and again after the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005, law-enforcement authorities across Europe launched mass-arrest operations, undertook widespread surveillance of mosques, carried out stops and searches of people who appeared to be Muslim, and used other intrusive measures that disrupted the lives of – and in many cases humiliated – law-abiding European citizens.
As public anxiety has abated, and senior officials have felt less pressure to show that they are doing something, the most flagrant abuses have declined.
But such practices are still being applied to a lesser degree, and they can be pulled out of the arsenal whenever political or social conditions dictate.
Fortunately, some of Europe’s leaders recognize the problem.
In late April, the European Parliament issued a report highlighting the danger that unrestricted data mining that relies on racial, ethnic, or national origin would subject innocent people to arbitrary stops, travel restrictions, and bans on employment or banking.
The report called for legislation to protect against ethnic profiling.
The solution is not to ignore the threat of terrorism, but to address the threat more intelligently.
Over the past two years, a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil-society groups in Hungary and Spain found that, when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported, the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law-enforcement outcome actually increased.
Police work became more efficient.
This makes sense.
When officers are required to articulate grounds for suspicion, they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice.
In the future, the European Union and its member states should fund more collaboration between police and minority communities.
The EU should combat radicalization by addressing exclusion, not by conflating conservative religious faith with terrorism.
And it should make clear that police may not use ethnic, racial, or religious stereotypes.
By treating people as suspicious purely because of who they are, how they look, or where they pray, rather than what they do or have done, ethnic profiling threatens the very ethos of the EU, a union firmly rooted in values of liberty, democracy, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Thailand’s Democratic Disorder
BANGKOK – From Thailand to Turkey to Ukraine, the relationship between ruling majorities and electoral minorities has become combustible – and is threatening to erode the legitimacy of democracy itself.
The unfolding crisis in Bangkok – where a political minority has taken to the streets to bring down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s democratically elected government – is a case in point.
Yingluck’s Pheu Thai Party (PTP) won an outright majority in Thailand’s 2011 general election, gaining 265 MPs in the 500-member lower house.
But the opposition Democratic Party – which returned 159 MPs, mainly from Bangkok and southern Thailand – has lately been staging protests in the capital.
The so-called “People’s Committee for Democratic Reform” – led by former Democratic Party MP Suthep Thaugsuban and supported by the Bangkok-based establishment – has effectively attempted to stage a coup.
The protests began when the government tried to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra – Yingluck’s brother and the PTP’s founder, who was overthrown by the military in 2006 – on charges of corruption and abuse of power.
(It also would have superseded the murder charges brought against the Democratic Party’s leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.)
But Yingluck’s subsequent attempt to backtrack on the amnesty measure failed to mollify the opposition.
In fact, the street protests intensified, fueled by a new grievance.
The Yingluck government had refused to accept the Constitutional Court’s ruling against a bill to change the senate from a half-appointed to a fully elected chamber.
The government asserted that the court did not have jurisdiction over constitutional amendments.
The People’s Committee viewed this rejection as an attempt to pressure the king into countersigning the law – and thus as a threat to royal prerogatives and the king’s exalted role in Thailand.
The People’s Committee’s position deserves explanation, if not agreement.
Since the turn of the century, Thaksin’s party machines, powered by his populist policies, have overcome constant challenges – from both the military and the Constitutional Court – to beat the conservative-royalist Democrats in every election.
Opposition forces, fed up as much with Thaksin’s corrupt practices as with his longstanding popularity, have recently begun seizing government ministries and calling for a royally appointed government.
If they succeed, PTP supporters will likely descend on Bangkok, much as they did in 2009-2010, after a “judicial coup” dissolved Thaksin’s People’s Power Party, the PTP’s predecessor, and the Democrats formed a coalition government.
But, this time, the protesters will be even angrier, and the stakes will be much higher, because the monarchy’s role in Thailand’s electoral democracy will be called into question.
The mere plausibility of such an outcome underscores Thailand’s deep political polarization.
The PTP’s supporters are happy with a system that grants them a political voice – indeed, predictable electoral majorities – and that safeguards their rights.
But the minority – which comprises up to two-fifths of the electorate – is at a loss.
Its legitimacy and influence depend not on winning electoral majorities, but on its strong alliances with the military, bureaucracy, and judiciary in defense of a traditional hierarchy that places the king at its apex.
Making matters worse, voters on both sides are tuning in only to views with which they agree, rather than attempting to understand and reconcile opposing arguments.
Social media – the much-lauded catalyst of democratization in authoritarian countries – has exacerbated the trend toward polarization in Thailand, just as it has in other electoral democracies that are struggling with a widening majority-minority divide, like Turkey and Malaysia.
In emerging democracies, electoral minorities tend to be tied to the old establishment, and often oppose change led by popular upstarts.
Feeling marginalized and resentful, they may turn to public platforms like social media and the streets to advance their causes and undermine their opponents’ authority.
The proliferation of information technology, together with the unprecedented popular participation that it has fueled, means that electoral minorities have a growing number of increasingly powerful tools at their disposal to organize movements aimed at paralyzing their countries’ governments and even shortening leaders’ terms in office.
Indeed, with so much seemingly at stake, a four- or five-year term may seem too long to wait for change.
But, while the right to peaceful protest is critically important in a democracy, electoral minorities should not use endless demonstrations to take the political system hostage.
In order to create a peaceful, stable, and effective democratic system, electoral minorities must accept the ballot box as the arbiter of political legitimacy.
At the same time, majorities should not view an electoral victory as a license to act without regard for minority concerns.
While the government must deliver for its constituents, it must also protect its opponents’ rights.
To this end, Thailand urgently needs a new social contract that allows elected representatives to do their jobs, without marginalizing the establishment-based minority.
Increasingly complex majority-minority dynamics are shaping the democratization prospects of a number of countries, and could influence democracy’s durability as a system of government.
Thailand’s experience suggests that efforts to subvert the system by thwarting the will of the majority may ultimately be fruitless, though not before imposing extremely high costs on everyone.

Europe Must Stand Up to Hungary and Poland
NEW YORK – Hungary and Poland have vetoed the European Union’s proposed €1.15 trillion ($1.4 trillion) seven-year budget and the €750 billion European recovery fund.
Although the two countries are the budget’s biggest beneficiaries, their governments are adamantly opposed to the rule-of-law conditionality that the EU has adopted at the behest of the European Parliament.
They know that they are violating the rule of law in egregious ways, and do not want to pay the consequences.
It is not so much an abstract concept like the rule of law that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and, to a lesser extent, Poland’s de facto ruler, Jarosław Kaczyński, oppose.
For them, the rule of law represents a practical limit on personal and political corruption.
The veto is a desperate gamble by two serial violators.
It was also an unprecedented step, coming at a moment when Europe is suffering from a dangerous surge of COVID-19 cases, and it threw the other EU countries’ representatives into confusion.
But when the shock wore off, closer analysis revealed that there is a way around the veto.
The rule-of-law regulations have been adopted.
In case there is no agreement on a new budget, the old budget, which expires at the end of 2020, is extended on a yearly basis.
Hungary and Poland would not receive any payments under this budget, because their governments are violating the rule of law.
Likewise, the recovery fund, called Next Generation EU, could be implemented by using an enhanced cooperation procedure, as Guy Verhofstadt has proposed.
If the EU went down this road, the Orbán-Kaczyński veto could be circumvented.
The question is whether the EU, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel perhaps leading the way, can muster the political will.
I am a committed supporter of the EU as a model of an open society built on the rule of law.
Being of Hungarian Jewish origin, I am particularly concerned with the situation in Hungary, where I have been active as a philanthropist for more than 30 years.
Orbán has constructed in Hungary an elaborate kleptocratic system to rob the country blind.
The amount by which he has enriched his family and friends is difficult to estimate but many of them have become exceedingly wealthy.
Orbán is now using the new wave of COVID-19 to amend the Hungarian Constitution and the electoral law (once again) and to entrench himself as prime minister for life by constitutional means.
That is a tragedy for the Hungarian people.
Let me give a few examples of how Orbán has robbed the Hungarian people.
He has transferred vast sums of public money to a number of private foundations that he indirectly controls.
By a clever constitutional trick, Orbán is now permanently removing these assets from the public domain; it would take a two-thirds majority of Parliament to return them to the Hungarian people.
The amounts involved add up to nearly $2.8 billion.
In a series of fraudulent transactions, companies close to Orbán purchased over 16,000 ventilators on behalf of Hungary for almost $1 billion, far exceeding the number of intensive care beds and medical personnel that could operate them.
An analysis of international trade data shows that Hungary paid the most in the EU for ventilators from China, at one point paying over 50 times more than Germany.
One of these companies also secured an order from Slovenia, whose prime minster, Janez Janša, is a close political ally of Orbán.
The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) needs to investigate whether the EU was defrauded.
The recent contract for the Russian vaccine that will make Hungary the first European country to use it deserves to be investigated.
At the same time, Orbán is seeking to avoid accountability for these actions, and taking steps to prevent a repeat of the local elections in 2019, when his Fidesz party lost control of the municipal government of Budapest and other major cities.
He is going out of his way to deprive Budapest of financial resources, vetoing the city’s application to borrow money from the European Investment Bank to buy new mass transportation equipment amenable to social distancing.
Budapest is now looking at a $290 million shortfall in its budget for 2021.
Similar conditions prevail in other cities with local governments that are not controlled by Fidesz.
Hungary’s opposition parties are bravely trying to challenge Orbán by forming a common list of candidates for the 2022 general election.
But their chances of success are limited because Orbán can change the rules at short notice, as he has already done several times before.
Conveniently, Orbán is planning to introduce the latest changes to the electoral law while the pandemic is raging, Budapest is under curfew, and soldiers are patrolling the streets.
Moreover, Orbán exercises almost total control over the countryside, where the majority of the population lives.
He controls the information they receive, and voting in many villages is not secret.
There is practically no way the opposition can prevail.
Only the EU can help.
EU funds, for example, should be directed to local authorities, where there is still a functioning democracy in Hungary, unlike at the national level.
The EU can’t afford to compromise on the rule-of-law provisions.
How it responds to the challenge posed by Orbán and Kaczyński will determine whether it survives as an open society true to the values upon which it was founded.

A World of Gray
CANBERRA – Václav Havel, the Czech playwright and dissident turned president, and North Korean despot Kim Jong-il might have lived on different planets, for all their common commitment to human dignity, rights, and democracy.
When they died just a day apart this month, the contrast was hard for the global commentariat to resist: Prague’s prince of light against Pyongyang’s prince of darkness.
But it is worth remembering that Manichaean good-versus-evil typecasting, to which former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair were famously prone, and of which we have had something of a resurgence in recent days, carries with it two big risks for international policymakers.
One risk is that such thinking limits the options for dealing effectively with those who are cast as irredeemably evil.
The debacle of the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 should have taught us once and for all the peril of talking only through the barrel of a gun to those whose behavior disgusts us.
Sometimes, threats to a civilian population will be so acute and immediate as to make coercive military intervention the only option, as with Muammar el-Qaddafi’s Libya, at least at the time of the imminent assault on Benghazi in March.
But more often it will be a matter of relying on less extreme measures, like targeted sanctions and threats of international prosecution – and on diplomatic pressure and persuasion.
Negotiating with the genocidal butchers of the Khmer Rouge was acutely troubling, personally and politically, for those of us involved, but those talks secured a lasting peace in Cambodia.
And it is only negotiation – albeit backed by good old-fashioned containment and deterrence – that can possibly deliver sustainable peace with Iran and North Korea.
The second risk that arises from seeing the world in black-and-white terms is greater public cynicism, thereby making ideals-based policymaking in the future even harder.
Expectations raised too high are expectations bound to be disappointed: think of former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook’s “ethical foreign policy” at the start of Blair’s premiership.
Political leaders who make a big play of “values” are often those most likely to stumble.
Think of the lamentable response by US President Bill Clinton’s administration to the Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Australia’s shameful rejection of asylum-seeking boat people in the Tampa affair under John Howard’s government a decade ago.
Then there is many Western governments’ highly selective embrace of democracy when it results in the election of those (like Hamas) whom they find unacceptable; the unwillingness of almost every nuclear-weapons state to match its disarmament rhetoric with credible action; and the almost universal double-talk on climate change.
But if double talk were an indictable offense, there would be few left to attend international summits.
The task is neither to pillory nor to sanctify political leaders caught in these traps, but somehow to reconcile what they will often see as hopelessly competing demands of moral values and national interests, and to find ways to get them to do more good and less harm.
A useful way forward in this respect may be to rethink fundamentally the concept of “national interest.”
Traditionally seen as having just two dimensions – economic and geostrategic – there is a strong case for adding a third: every country’s interest in being, and being seen to be, a good international citizen.
Actively helping to solve global public-goods challenges (like climate change, human-rights protection, international piracy, drug trafficking, cross-border population flows, and elimination of weapons of mass destruction), even when there is no direct economic or strategic payoff, is not simply the foreign policy equivalent of Boy Scout good deeds.
Selfless cooperation on these issues can actually work to a country’s advantage by boosting its reputation and generating reciprocal support: my help in solving your drug-trafficking problem today will increase the chances of you supporting my asylum-seeker problem tomorrow.
And a story couched in these realist terms is likely to be easier to sell to domestic constituencies than one pitched as disinterested altruism.
Countries should pursue what the great international-relations scholar Hedley Bull called “purposes beyond ourselves”: our common humanity demands no less.
But the real world is a place of gray shades, not black and white, and more often than not the cause of human decency and security will be better served by recognizing and working around that constraint rather than challenging it head on.

Reinventing the Inter-Korean Relationship
SEOUL – On February 12, 2013, North Korea carried out its third nuclear test in the run-up to the inauguration of a new administration – my own – in the South.
Around that time, the Presidential Transition Committee adopted the “Trust-Building Process on the Korean Peninsula” as a key policy of the new administration.
Though the North’s nuclear test created pressure to revise the trust-building process, I made it clear that I would stay the course.
Indeed, since its conception, the trust-building process has taken into account possible military provocations from North Korea, and is intended specifically to break the vicious cycle of provocations followed by compromise and rewards to placate tensions.
The trust-building process was formulated to overcome the limitations of both appeasement and hardline policies: while the former depended entirely on the North’s tenuous good faith, the latter implied only relentless pressure.
The trust-building process, based on the strength of formidable deterrence, is intended to build sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula by making North Korea pay dearly for its aggressive acts while ensuring opportunities for change and assistance if it is willing to become a responsible member of the international community.
Since the launch of my administration, North Korea has escalated its military threats and bellicose rhetoric against the South.
In April 2013, the North took the extreme step of unilaterally barring South Korean workers from entering the Gaesong Industrial Complex, a symbol of inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation, and withdrawing all of its own workers.
Following the shutdown of the Gaesong facility, some suggested that the North be offered, through back-channel contacts, incentives to improve inter-Korean relations.
But, aware that such contacts with the North had produced many adverse effects in the past, I opted for an open and transparent proposal for dialogue.
I repeatedly emphasized to North Korea that trust can be built only by cooperating on small but meaningful projects and abiding by our promises – and calling attention to problematic behaviors – along the way.
I have also explained to the international community the credibility and necessity of anchoring our policy in the trust-building process, securing support from many countries.
North Korea finally came to the dialogue in mid-July, and a month later agreed to normalize the operation of the Gaesong Industrial Complex in a constructive manner.
As follow-up measures, a secretariat for the joint management of the complex was established, and government officials from the two Koreas began daily meetings.
It was a small but significant step forward, considering that inter-Korean dialogue has been virtually non-existent over the past five years, and that tensions stoked by the North reached a peak in the early days of my administration.
But there is still a long way to go to full normalization of the Gaesong facility, not to mention inter-Korean relations.
The North remains lukewarm on the follow-up dialogue for passage of workers, communication, and customs clearance, all of which are essential.
Furthermore, North Korea unilaterally canceled the reunion of separated families only a few days before the agreed date, breaking the hearts of those who had long been eagerly awaiting it.
North Korea then resumed its slander and threats against us.
Following the recent purge of Jang Song-thaek, known as the North’s “second man,” the political situation on the peninsula has spurred further concern among Koreans and the international community, serving as a reminder of how unpredictable the current situation is – and thus how difficult it has become to develop inter-Korean relations.
For the past ten months, my government has sought to abide by international norms in implementing its North Korea policy, while trying to meet people’s expectations.
We will stick to these fundamental principles and set the following priorities for future North Korea policies.
First, we will pave the way to peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula.
My government will maintain a strong deterrent capability, because airtight security constitutes the foundation of genuine peace.
From this point, the government will strive to forge sustainable peace through dialogue, exchanges, and cooperation, in order to achieve unification and improve the quality of life of all Koreans.
Korea will also work to consolidate cooperation with the international community in this process.
Unification is certainly a matter for the Korean people to decide, but it should be achieved with the support of neighboring countries, ensuring that unification benefits all parties in the region.
Second, the government will endeavor to upgrade the trust-building process.
To chip away at the deep-rooted suspicion between the two Koreas, we will work to strengthen inter-Korean dialogue and discuss matters prudentially while keeping promises on what is agreed.
My government will devise various measures to expand the scope of South-North dialogue and cooperation.
And we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to the North, as well as maintaining efforts to hold reunions of separated families and to resolve the issue of prisoners of war and abductees who have been kept in the North.
In addition, we will increase the transparency of our North Korea policies.
Of course, considering the nature of inter-Korean relations, not all matters can be disclosed in full detail.
But providing as much accurate information as possible to the public is the best way to ensure firm popular support for these policies and their effective implementation.
Third, Korea will seek denuclearization of the North as a means to pursue joint progress on the Korean Peninsula and across Northeast Asia.
Indeed, inter-Korean relations can properly progress when the North forswears nuclear development and joins the South in a partnership based on mutual confidence.
If the North shows a firm commitment to denuclearization and takes practical steps to this end, we will take the lead in securing the international community’s support for active assistance in the North’s economic development. Furthermore, we will endeavor to help the peninsula progress together with our neighbors in the Northeast Asian region.
North Korea has recently shown interest in setting up special economic development zones.
But no country including South Korea would invest in the North if it persists in nuclear development.
If North Korea truly cares for its people, it must give up the unrealistic twin goals of nuclearization and economic development.
Instead, it must abide by international norms and behave predictably if it is to get along with its neighbors and become a credible partner.
Bringing North Korea in from the cold is important to our foreign policy in a broader context as well.
That is why I have proposed the Eurasian Initiative, which envisions connecting the Eurasian continent’s divided logistics networks and removing obstacles that hinder exchanges to make the continent a viable single entity.
Furthermore, it is linked to my plan for peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia. To make this Initiative succeed, the Korean Peninsula must be the first to dismantle the wall of distrust, for it is the gateway that links Eurasia and the Pacific.
The project to build a World Peace Park in the DMZ (demilitarized zone) that divides the Korean Peninsula could be a starting point.
From here, the countries of the Continent and the Ocean together with the two Koreas must build trust and promote cooperation, and disseminate such practices to other areas.
As such, the Korean Peninsula would be able to cast off its old role as a stumbling block and revive itself as a stepping-stone for peace in Eurasia and Northeast Asia.

A Way Out for Ukraine and Russia
LONDON – The leaders of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Astana, Kazakstan, on January 15 to discuss, once again, an end to the fighting that has roiled eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region since last spring.
Hopes for a viable agreement are not high.
One reason why the crisis in Ukraine has proved so difficult to overcome is that its roots stretch far outside the country’s borders.
Finding a genuine solution will require the resolution of a dispute between Russia and the West that dates back to the 1990s, before Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power.
At its heart, the conflict in Ukraine is about a disagreement over NATO’s expansion into what Russia regards as its “near abroad.”
Fortunately, a solution is possible – but it will require a reworking of Europe’s security architecture.
Both sides are deeply committed to their positions.
In November, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told the BBC that Russia required a “100% guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO.”
That is a promise that Western countries will be unable to provide.
For them, what is at stake is the principle that sovereign countries have the right to chart their own course, rather than be entangled in a larger power’s sphere of influence.
Indeed, it was this principle that, once invoked to justify NATO enlargement in the 1990s, put the two sides on a collision course.
With Russia’s neighbors free to join the alliance, the natural result could only be a new dividing line, one pressing up against the Russian Federation’s western and southern borders.
This outcome was foreseen by the veteran American diplomat George F. Kennan.
In an interview he gave to the New York Times in May 1998, he predicted that NATO enlargement would lead to a new Cold War.
Now that Kennan’s prediction has all but come to pass, the parties to the conflict would be wise to take a lesson from the diplomatic efforts that helped bring the original Cold War to an end – in particular, the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE).
NATO enlargement may have rendered the treaty’s detailed provisions obsolete, but its underlying approach – a transparent inspections regime that enforces limitations on the overall quantity and, crucially, the regional concentrations of ground forces – remains applicable today.
For the West, a revamped CFE Treaty would help mitigate worries about military threats in the area that Russia has traditionally considered its sphere of influence.
Violations of the treaty would be easily detectable and allow time for the West to deploy countermeasures.
In addition, there would be no formal prohibition of NATO membership for Ukraine – or for any other country in the Russian periphery.
For Russia, a new treaty would allow it to live with the hitherto nightmare scenario of Ukrainian accession to NATO; as long as the pact remained in force, Ukraine’s membership would have no military consequences.
NATO, at least in the Russian hinterland, would become first and foremost a political organization.
Above all, a new treaty would allow both Russia and the West to secure their interests in a balanced and binding agreement.
For Russia, this would mean a significant improvement on what it has been offered since the end of the Cold War.
Though invitations by the West to join organizations such as the NATO-Russia Council or the G-8 may have been symbolically important and thus politically valuable, these venues provide only forums for discussion; they do not produce binding agreements.
A new treaty would do more than anything else to bring peace to Ukraine.
It would eliminate the primary motive behind Russia’s support for separatism in the country’s southeast: ensuring that Ukraine remains ineligible for NATO membership.
The dispute over the fate of Crimea would continue; but an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the issue could be made a precondition of the treaty’s entry into full effect.
There are two other obvious objections to this proposal.
The first is that Putin would reject a treaty with NATO.
That should not stop the West from making the offer.
With the Russian economy in serious trouble, Putin may be looking for a way out of his corner.
The second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia’s economy – and ultimately Putin himself.
But this would be an irresponsibly dangerous and ultimately counterproductive strategy.
After all, economic and political breakdown in Russia would have profound adverse consequences well beyond Russia’s borders – particularly for Ukraine.

Treason in the Air
COPENHAGEN – Discussions about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out “impure” thinking, to the point of questioning the value of democratic debate.
But shutting down discussion simply means the disappearance of reason from public policy.
In March, Al Gore’s science adviser and prominent climate researcher, Jim Hansen, proclaimed that when it comes to dealing with global warming, the “democratic process isn’t working.”
Although science has demonstrated that CO2 from fossil fuels is heating the planet, politicians are unwilling to follow his advice and stop building coal-fired power plants.
Hansen argues that, “the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process.
What is frustrating people, me included, is that democratic action affects elections, but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash.”
Although he doesn’t tell us what the second or third action is, he has turned up in a British court to defend six activists who damaged a coal power station.
He argues that we need “more people chaining themselves to coal plants,” a point repeated by Gore.
The Nobel laureate in economics Paul Krugman goes further.
After the narrow passage of the Waxman-Markey climate-change bill in the United States House of Representatives, Krugman said that there was no justification for a vote against it. He called virtually all of the members who voted against it, “climate deniers” who were committing “treason against the planet.”
Krugman said that the “irresponsibility and immorality” of the representatives’ democratic viewpoints were “unforgivable” and a “betrayal.”
He thus accused almost half of the democratically elected members of the House, from both parties, of treason for holding the views that they do – thereby essentially negating democracy.
Less well-known pundits make similar points, suggesting that people with “incorrect” views on global warming should face Nuremburg-style trials or be tried for crimes against humanity.
There is clearly a trend.
The climate threat is so great – and democracies are doing so little about it – that people conclude that maybe democracy is part of the problem, and that perhaps people ought not to be allowed to express heterodox opinions on such an important topic.
This is scary, although not without historical precedent.
Much of the American McCarthyism of the 1940’s and 1950’s was driven by the same burning faith in the righteousness of the mission – a faith that saw fundamental rights abrogated.
We would be well served to go down a different path.
Gore and others often argue that if the science of climate change concludes that CO2 emissions are harmful, it follows that we should stop those harmful emissions – and that we are morally obliged to do so.
But this misses half the story.
We could just as well point out that since science tells us that speeding cars kill many people, we should cut speed limits to almost nothing. We do no such thing, because we recognize that the costs of high-speed cars must be weighed against the benefits of a mobile society.
Indeed, nobody emits CO2 for fun.
CO2 emissions result from other, generally beneficial acts, such as burning coal to keep warm, burning kerosene to cook, or burning gas to transport people.
The benefits of fossil fuels must be weighed against the costs of global warming.
Gore and Hansen want a moratorium on coal-fired power plants, but neglect the fact that the hundreds of new power plants that will be opened in China and India in the coming years could lift a billion people out of poverty.
Negating this outcome through a moratorium is clearly no unmitigated good.
Likewise, reasonable people can differ on their interpretation of the Waxman-Markey bill.
Even if we set aside its masses of pork-barrel spending, and analyses that show it may allow more emissions in the US for the first decades, there are more fundamental problems with this legislation.
At a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars annually, it will have virtually no impact on climate change.
If all of the bill’s many provisions were entirely fulfilled, economic models show that it would reduce the temperature by the end of the century by 0.11°C (0.2°F) – reducing warming by less than 4%.
Even if every Kyoto-obligated country passed its own, duplicate Waxman-Markey bills – which is implausible and would incur significantly higher costs – the global reduction would amount to just 0.22°C (0.35°F) by the end of this century.
The reduction in global temperature would not be measurable in a hundred years, yet the cost would be significant and payable now.
Is it really treason against the planet to express some skepticism about whether this is the right way forward?
Is it treason to question throwing huge sums of money at a policy that will do virtually no good in a hundred years?
Is it unreasonable to point out that the inevitable creation of trade barriers that will ensue from Waxman-Markey could eventually cost the world ten times more than the damage climate change could ever have wrought?
Today’s focus on ineffective and costly climate policies shows poor judgment.
But I would never want to shut down discussion about these issues – whether it is with Gore, Hansen, or Krugman.
Everybody involved in this discussion should spend more time building and acknowledging good arguments, and less time telling others what they cannot say.
Wanting to shut down the discussion is simply treason against reason.

Schadenfreude Capitalism
PRINCETON – The protracted financial and economic crisis discredited first the American model of capitalism, and then the European version.
Now it looks as if the Asian approach may take some knocks, too.
Coming after the failure of state socialism, does this mean that there is no correct way of organizing an economy?
In the aftermath of the subprime crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, fingers were pointed at the United States as an example of how badly things could go wrong.
The American model had supposedly failed, its reputation weakened first by the Iraq invasion, and then by the financial crisis.
Anyone who dreamed of the American way of life now looked stupid.
Immediately after Lehman Brothers’ collapse, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück put this diagnosis as a challenge not only to the US, but also to other countries – notably the United Kingdom – that had “Americanized” their financial system.
The problem, Steinbrück argued, lay in over-reliance on highly complex financial instruments, propagated by globalized American institutions: “The financial crisis is above all an American problem.
The other G-7 financial ministers in continental Europe share this opinion.”
Criticism of America did not stop there.
Steinbrück’s successor, Wolfgang Schäuble, persisted in the same tone, attacking “clueless” American monetary policy, which was supposedly designed only to feed the American financial monster.
But such criticism ignores the problems faced by banks that did not use or deal in complex financial products.
Bank regulators had long insisted that the safest possible financial instrument was a bond issued by a rich industrial country.
Then came the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis, with its roots in lax government finance in some (mostly southern European) countries.
Critics now had a new focus.
Naturally, many conservative Americans were delighted by the imminent failure of what they saw as Europe’s tax-and-spend model, with its addiction to a costly and inefficient welfare state.
They were not the only critics.
The chairman of China Investment Corporation, Jin Liquin, commented skeptically on a proposed Chinese bailout of Europe, which he called “a worn-out welfare society” with “outdated” welfare laws that induce dependence and sloth.
Criticism of large European transfer payments may have some justification, say, insofar as French, Greek, and Italian civil servants could indeed retire young.
And restrictive labor laws have indeed discouraged many firms from hiring new workers.
But such criticism captures only one small part of Europe’s difficulties.
The fiscal problems of Greece and Spain were also the result of spending a great deal on high-technology and high-prestige projects: facilities for the Olympic Games, new airport buildings, high-speed train links.
And Spain and Ireland before the crisis did not have a fiscal problem, owing to the rapid economic growth produced by a real-estate boom that seemed to promise a new era of economic miracles.
One of the most widely used Chinese terms of recent years is 幸灾乐祸 (xìng zāi lè huò), best translated as “schadenfreude”: somebody else – some other society – tripped on an enormous political banana peel.
Asian critics looking at America and Europe could easily convince themselves that the Western model of democratic capitalism was collapsing.
But haven’t similar capital investments and soaring property prices also been an increasingly important part of China’s transformation since the 1990’s?
Chinese citizens are now not only frustrated with the high-speed trains’ increasingly obvious imperfections and inadequacies, but are also wondering whether their government has set the right priorities.
Schadenfreude comes in several flavors.
Russia’s Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Argentina’s President Christina Kirchner liked to think that their versions of a controlled economy and society built in the aftermath of default on foreign debt offered a more viable alternative to cosmopolitan international capitalism.
Both now face major problems with disillusioned populations.
In short, the world’s major economies share many more vulnerabilities than is commonly supposed.
A response to global challenges based simply on schadenfreude may promote a short-term sense of well-being, as people often like to think how lucky they are to have escaped a mess that originated elsewhere. But soon they encounter their own banana peel; indeed, today’s global economy is a riot of slipping economic models.
And tomorrow the cacophony will be even louder.
So, is there any absolutely sure way of organizing economic life?
If the quest is for a way of securing perpetual security or dominance, then the answer is “no.”
Underpinning comparisons of different models is the wish to find an absolutely secure way of generating wealth and prosperity.
In a market economy, however, competition rapidly leads to emulation, and high profits associated with an original innovation turn out to be transitory. From a longer-term perspective, there are only temporary surges of relative wealth, just as there are only temporary surges of apparent success in a particular way of doing business.
During the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the pioneers and innovators in textiles, steel, and railroads were not, on the whole, rewarded with immense riches: their profits were competed away.
The late nineteenth and the twentieth century produced a different sort of growth, because public policies and resources could be used to protect accumulated wealth from the otherwise inevitable erosion stemming from competitive pressure.
Behind the idea of a particular model of growth was the belief that a sensibly ordered state could somehow capture and eternalize the fruits of economic success.
Like it or not, states cannot organize themselves in that way any more than individuals can.

Justice Delayed, Not Denied, in Bosnia
CHICAGO – On March 24, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) sentenced Radovan Karadžić – the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1990s war in the Balkans – to 40 years in prison for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
It is a judgment that will profoundly influence international law, deter those who might otherwise commit atrocities, and open the possibility of political reconciliation in Bosnia.
Lawless leaders, such as those in Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Russia, and the Islamic State, have just been reminded of their vulnerability to international justice.
And would-be war criminals are not the only ones who should think carefully about the verdict.
Karadžić’s incendiary views – “Muslims cannot live with others,” he once said – still resonate in dark corners of a frightened Europe struggling to accommodate hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and in the nativist presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the United States.
Twenty years ago, in 1996, I was senior counsel to Madeleine Albright, then America’s ambassador to the United Nations.
We pushed hard in the US National Security Council for Karadžić’s arrest; he had been indicted by the ICTY a year earlier, along with Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladić, whose trial in The Hague is ongoing.
For years, however, both men eluded capture, in part because many NATO and US officials were not yet prepared to accept the risks associated with apprehending them.
That timidity was a mistake.
For years, it allowed Karadžić and Mladić to influence Bosnian politics and swagger in defiance of the rule of law.
Their trials, following their arrests in Serbia less than a decade ago, have revealed evidence of acts of savagery not seen in Europe since World War II.
Karadžić’s crimes were a primary reason why then-President Bill Clinton created the post of US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, and why the Senate confirmed me to fill that post during Clinton’s second term.
Karadžić had plunged his country into the depths of hell, and then, having been indicted for his crimes, was on the run.
The US needed a full-time envoy to help build and support the tribunals that would eventually bring him and other masterminds of atrocity to justice.
And indeed, his conviction demonstrates once again the crucial role that the US has played in the pursuit of international justice, starting at Nuremberg and continuing to this day.
Bosnian Muslim victims have waited decades for an international court to rule that the ethnic cleansing they suffered – especially in 1992, the worst year of the conflict – was genocide. It is significant that the tribunal found Karadžić guilty of crimes against humanity during the war, for these types of crimes can be as monstrous as genocide.
The tribunal also found that acts of genocide (killing Muslims and “causing serious bodily or mental harm”) were committed when Bosnian Serbs attacked seven predominantly Muslim municipalities in 1992.
The judges ruled that there was not enough evidence of Karadžić’s intent to destroy all or part of the country’s Muslim people to convict him of genocide for his role in the ethnic cleansing.
Sarajevo, the capital, suffered three years of sniping, shelling, and starvation tactics that killed thousands of Bosnian Muslims.
As the West dithered, Karadžić sustained the siege and sought the extermination of the city’s inhabitants.
The tribunal convicted him of the “spread of terror,” a massive war crime, and of murdering civilians in Sarajevo, essentially labeling him a terrorist, not unlike those who are destroying the lives of Muslims, Yazidis, and Christians in Iraq and Syria today.
Significantly, Karadžić was convicted of genocide for the massacre of thousands of Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995.
For the survivors of the Bosnian war, that verdict demonstrates that the culminating act of his criminal leadership was indeed genocidal.
Finally, the crude tactic Karadžić employed in May 1995 to seize UN peacekeepers as hostages in order to intimidate NATO earned him another guilty verdict for war crimes.
That will be remembered as peacekeepers are called upon to manage conflict situations around the world.
The judgment could also have important implications for Bosnia’s political future.
The Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the war in 1995, have yet to unite Bosnia’s ethnic groups, and the country has been sliding deeper into turmoil, and edging toward breakup.
During my visits to Bosnia, the victims of Karadžić’s crimes have told me that they needed to see the truth revealed first before they could reconcile with their Serb neighbors.
Until now, the truth has been slow in coming.
The current president of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, uses genocide denial to sustain his power and stoke hate-filled separatism.
But Karadžić’s conviction for genocide eviscerates his divisive propaganda.
With this verdict, perhaps a rapprochement between Muslims and Serbs can finally begin.
The lesson that politicians in Europe, the US, and elsewhere should draw from the judgment is that they are playing with fire in seeking electoral advantage by attacking Muslims.
As events in Bosnia in the 1990s and in Syria and Iraq today so tragically demonstrate, the flames they are fanning could easily become a conflagration.
Karadžić will appeal the judgment.
But, finally, the survivors of his atrocities will be able to stop living in the past and begin looking toward the future.

Putin’s Tipping Point?
NEW YORK – When incompetence in the Kremlin turns murderous, its incumbents can begin to tremble.
As news of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine trickled into Russia, people with a long memory recalled the Soviet Union’s attack, 31 years ago this September, on Korean Air Lines Flight 007, and its political consequences.
Back then, the Kremlin first lied to the world by saying that it had nothing to do with the missing KAL plane.
Later it claimed that the South Korean jet was on an American spy mission.
But, within the Soviet leadership, the incident was a tipping point.
It ended the career of Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, Chief of the General Staff and a hardliner of the hardest sort, whose inconsistent and unconvincing efforts to justify the downing of the plane proved deeply embarrassing to the Kremlin.
Ogarkov’s ineptness (and inept mendacity), together with the mounting failure since 1979 of the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan, exposed the system’s advanced decrepitude.
The stagnation that had begun during Leonid Brezhnev’s rule deepened after his death in 1982.
His successors, first the KGB’s Yuri Andropov and then the Communist Party Central Committee’s Konstantin Chernenko, not only had one foot in the grave when they came to power, but were also completely unequipped to reform the Soviet Union.
The huge loss of life in Afghanistan (equal to the United States’ losses in Vietnam, but in a far shorter period of time) already suggested to many that the Kremlin was becoming a danger to itself; the attack on a civilian airliner seemed to confirm that emerging view.
It was this realization that spurred Mikhail Gorbachev’s rise to power, as well as support among the leadership for Gorbachev’s reformist policies of perestroika and glasnost.
Of course, history is not destiny, but one can be sure that at least some in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s entourage, if not Putin himself, have been thinking about Ogarkov’s failure and its impact on the Soviet elite.
After all, Kremlin leaders, Putin included, define themselves through what was, not what could be.
Indeed, Putin’s rationale for annexing Crimea closely resembles Brezhnev’s reasoning for invading Afghanistan: to confound enemies seeking to surround the country.
In 2004, speaking to Russian veterans about the Afghan invasion, Putin explained that there were legitimate geopolitical reasons to protect the Soviet Central Asian border, just as in March he cited security concerns to justify his Ukrainian land grab.
In the Brezhnev era, expansionist policies reflected the country’s new energy-derived wealth.
Putin’s military build-up and modernization of the past decade was also fueled by energy exports.
But Russia’s latest energy windfall has masked Putin’s incompetent economic management, with growth and government revenues now entirely reliant on the hydrocarbons sector.
Moreover, Putin’s incompetence extends far beyond the economy.
His security forces remain brutal and unaccountable; in some parts of the country, they have merged with criminal gangs.
His managed judiciary provides no comfort to ordinary people; and the country’s military installations, submarines, oilrigs, mining shafts, hospitals, and retirement homes regularly blow up, collapse, or sink, owing to neglect and zero liability.
When public support for Putin’s annexation of Crimea wanes – as it will – his failings will shine more starkly in the light of the MH17 catastrophe.
If the Russian state functioned well, Putin could continue to withstand pressure from opposition leaders.
But the opposition’s charge that Putin’s regime is composed of “swindlers and thieves” will resonate more strongly, because Russians can now see the results all around them.
By making himself, in effect, the state, Putin, like the gerontocracy that collapsed with Gorbachev’s rise, is increasingly viewed as responsible for all state failures.
And though thoughtful Russians may be hostages to Putin’s arrogance and blunders, the rest of the world is not.
Indeed, his partners – particularly the other BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) – are now unlikely to be able to turn a blind eye to his contempt for international law and for his neighbors’ national sovereignty, as they did during their recent Brazilian summit.
And Europe’s last blinders about Putin seem to have fallen, with the result that serious sanctions are almost certain to be imposed.
Putin is only 61, a decade younger than the leaders who led the Soviet Union to the precipice, and the constitution permits him to remain in power for at least another ten years.
But with GDP up by just 1.3% in 2013 – and with sanctions likely to hasten the economy’s decline – patriotic pride will not be able to shield him much longer.
By overplaying its hand in Afghanistan and lying to the world about the downing of KAL 007, the Soviet regime exposed and accelerated the rot that made its collapse inevitable.
There is no reason to believe in a different fate for Putin’s effort to re-establish Russia as an imperial power.

The Power of Civil Society in a Post-Pandemic World
LAHORE – On May 25, 2020, a 17-year-old girl filmed a disturbing video, which subsequently went viral, of a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota kneeling on the neck of a black man, handcuffed and lying facedown on the pavement, for nine minutes and 29 seconds.
The man, George Floyd, died that day.
For millions of people worldwide, Floyd’s death was a wake-up call regarding the pervasiveness of systemic racism and police violence.
The Black Lives Matter movement capitalized on this growing awareness, organizing protests on the streets of cities across the United States, which inspired demonstrations from France to Colombia to South Africa.
And, in a testament to the power of organization, the protests effected real change.
The police officer who killed Floyd, Derek Chauvin, has now been convicted of murder and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.
But the BLM protests achieved something more consequential: the creation of an international commission, on which I served, to examine police racism in the US.
We found that the persistent systemic racism against African-Americans in the US constitutes a crime against humanity and merits an investigation by the International Criminal Court.
This is the power and essence of civil society.
As the world attempts to “build back better” from the COVID-19 pandemic, it must be harnessed to make progress on a broad array of pressing issues, from economic inequality and educational inequities to racial justice and climate change.
To those who were not paying attention to systemic racism or police violence before Floyd’s death, it might seem that BLM had an impact relatively quickly.
But the fight has been long and difficult – and it is far from over.
The same is true for other civil-rights movements, which often demand a deep and enduring resilience from their participants.
Consider the women’s movement in my home country, Pakistan.
For decades, Pakistani women have fought against repressive norms, discriminatory attitudes, and legislation that limited women’s status or rights.
Progress has been slow and inconsistent, but we have stood our ground.
And the gains we have made instill the hope that continues to motivate and inform our work today.
The importance of such efforts must not be underestimated.
As Nelson Mandela, that global icon of freedom, explained in 2001, “a vibrant network and range of civil society activities and organs” is essential to “cement the foundations” of democracy.
Today, those foundations seem to be under siege.
Many countries are experiencing an alarming drift toward authoritarianism.
Even the most consolidated democracies are facing the erosion of citizens’ trust in the institutions that underpin them.
Just as the pandemic has underscored the fragility of human life, it has also highlighted the vulnerability of our democracies to a different class of ailment, including political polarization and disagreement on basic facts.
Like a human body, a democracy needs proper care to remain in good health.
Akin to a health screening, civil society reveals a democracy’s afflictions before it is too late to treat them.
When international human-rights principles and democratic values are not being reflected in people’s lives, it is civil society – organized in groups like BLM – that sounds the alarm.
This includes ensuring that authorities do not illegitimately expand or extend the emergency powers they have exercised during the pandemic.
Governments have a responsibility to listen to and embrace the voices and values of civil society.
Rather than fearing, dismissing, or repressing their critics, leaders must engage with them, especially the most vulnerable.
But where governments shirk this responsibility, human-rights defenders must continue to fight.
Many wonder whether civil society can survive democratic erosion and the slide toward authoritarianism in many countries.
But this question is impossible to answer today; and trying to do so might even prove detrimental.
Human-rights defenders can afford neither fatalism nor apathy.
Instead, we must continue to show courage and determination, like our brothers and sisters in places like Hong Kong, Harare, Minsk, and Yangon.
We must harness the energy, eloquence, and anger of the young on issues ranging from inequality and racism to climate change, and advance clear, achievable roadmaps for change.
And, above all, we must not despair.
As Mandela reminded us, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.”

The Silver Fox of Dictatorship and Democracy
MOSCOW – Throughout his years in power, Eduard Shevardnadze was known as the “silver fox,” a man who seemed to glide effortlessly from leader of Soviet Georgia and Kremlin Politburo member to Mikhail Gorbachev’s reform-minded foreign minister, before reemerging as post-Soviet Georgia’s pro-Western president, ironically opposing Gorbachev.
He regarded himself as a hero who liberated Georgia from Russia’s tight embrace.
He was also one of the most corrupt politicians his country ever saw.
By the end of his life, Shevardnadze had become a political pariah in Georgia, the West, and Russia, where he was viewed as an architect of the Soviet Union’s dissolution.
Yet, even if he was largely forgotten after the Rose Revolution of 2003, when he was ousted by his one-time protégé, Mikheil Saakashvili, his cunning and skill at manipulating political forces still enabled him to manage his legacy to his advantage.
The staunchly pro-American Saakashvili launched successful economic reforms and an all-out assault on police corruption, though he, too, eventually was accused of taking bribes and indulging autocratic impulses.
Having come to power in the revolt that overthrew the corrupt Shevardnadze, he resorted to the same Soviet-style techniques – intimidating and discrediting opponents, dispersing dissenters by force – to keep his opponents at bay.
The question Georgians have been asking ever since is whether Shevardnadze was really overthrown at all.
Knowing the extent of his unpopularity in 2003, many believe that he was ready to leave power but needed a successor who would ensure that his legacy (and his wealth) survived.
To be sure, Saakashvili became famous as Georgia’s justice minister for submitting corruption charges against the Shevardnadze family, and early in his presidency was able to reclaim for the state $15 million dollars of the Shevardnadze fortune.
But Saakashvili’s government never touched Shevardnadze and his family.
Regardless of whether this theory is true, its persistence lies at the core of Shevardnadze’s legacy.
Throughout his career, he was known to play all sides, at times threatening his resignation, only to stay on – or accusing enemies of assassination plots, only to stay alive.
In the 1970s, he would flatter Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev with spectacular displays of fealty to the Kremlin, only to meet with protesting Georgian students in support of their right, in opposition to the Kremlin’s wishes, to speak Georgian, not Russian, as a state language.
Everything at which Georgians excelled under Shevardnadze in the Soviet era – entrepreneurship, education, and culture – was greatly neglected by him in the 1990s.
Similarly, whereas tens of thousands of functionaries were indicted for corruption or lost their jobs under his leadership in the 1970s, the post-Soviet Shevardnadze of the 1990s reportedly joked that he should have arrested himself, but that he deserved his wealth for his priceless political contribution.
In 1999, during the New York celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, I myself heard Shevardnadze assert that Georgia had given the twentieth century two historic figures: “One who erected the Iron Curtain [Joseph Stalin], and one who tore it down” – meaning himself.
Surely, Shevardnadze’s political skills were worthy of another great Soviet politician from the Caucasus, the Armenian Anastas Mikoyan, once Stalin’s trusted trade minister and later Nikita Khrushchev’s fellow anti-Stalinist and deputy prime minister.
Mikoyan, as one joke had it, left the Kremlin one day in heavy rain and refused to share a colleague’s umbrella. “It’s ok,” he said, “I will walk between the raindrops.”
Likewise, Shevardnadze resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia in the 1980s, ostensibly in protest against Soviet rule, only to be appointed Soviet Foreign Minister by Gorbachev.
Having gained the trust of Western leaders and overseen the dismantling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, he then resigned in 1990, declaring that Russia – under Gorbachev – was returning to dictatorship.
That pose as democracy’s guardian earned Shevardnadze independent Georgia’s presidency at a time when the country was vulnerable to civil war.
He held the post for 11 years.
Was Shevardnadze ever honest?
Was he a democrat or a despot?
The reality of the times was that he was both.
His death brings closer the end of the Gorbachev generation of reform communists, those who – like Shevardnadze and the late Boris Yeltsin – presented a stark contrast in the late 1980s to the dour Brezhnev-era hard-liners, spurring (mostly inadvertently) the collapse of the Soviet empire and the long transition to democracy.
As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s corrupt and authoritarian rule demonstrates every day, that transition is far from finished.
Yet there is some good news.
Last year, Georgia elected its new president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, through a peaceful and legitimate process; earlier this summer, the country signed a European Union Association Agreement, implying closer connections to the West.
None of this would have been possible without Shevardnadze’s decades-long career of cunning, yet brave, political triangulation.

Central Banks and the Revenge of Politics
FRANKFURT – The reputation of central banks has always had its ups and downs.
For years, central banks’ prestige has been almost unprecedentedly high.
But a correction now seems inevitable, with central-bank independence becoming a key casualty.
Central banks’ reputation reached a peak before and at the turn of the century, thanks to the so-called Great Moderation.
Low and stable inflation, sustained growth, and high employment led many to view central banks as a kind of master of the universe, able – and expected – to manage the economy for the benefit of all.
The depiction of US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan as “Maestro” exemplified this perception.
The 2008 global financial crisis initially bolstered central banks’ reputation further.
With resolute action, monetary authorities made a major contribution to preventing a repeat of the Great Depression.
They were, yet again, lauded as saviors of the world economy.
But central banks’ successes fueled excessively high expectations, which encouraged most policymakers to leave their monetary counterparts largely responsible for macroeconomic management.
Such “expectational” and, in turn, “operational” overburdening has exposed monetary policy’s true limitations.
In other words, central banks’ good reputation now seems to be backfiring.
And “personality overburdening” – when trust in the success of monetary policy is concentrated on the person at the helm of the institution – means that individual leaders’ reputations are likely to suffer as well.
Yet central banks cannot simply abandon their new operational burdens, particularly with regard to financial stability, which, as the 2008 crisis starkly demonstrated, cannot be maintained by price stability alone.
On the contrary, a period of low and stable interest rates may even foster financial fragility, leading to a “Minsky moment,” when asset values suddenly collapse, bringing down the whole system.
The limits of inflation targeting are now clear, and the strategy should be discarded.
Central banks now have to reconcile the need to maintain price stability with the responsibility – regardless of whether it is legally mandated – to reduce financial vulnerability.
This will not be easy, not least because of another new operational burden that has been placed on many central banks: macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision.
Micro-prudential supervision, in particular, implies the risk of political pressure, interference with central banks’ independence, and policy conflicts, all of which could influence the behavior of financial intermediaries, by encouraging them to assume greater risk.
They know that their supervisor has powerful tools at its disposal – for example, it can lower borrowing costs, thereby protecting banks (at least for a while) – and a strong interest in protecting its reputation.
But, given the overburdening of central banks, reputational defense may be beyond their capacity.
While this is a global phenomenon, the European Central Bank is exceptionally weighed down.
As the central bank of the 19 member states of the European Monetary Union (EMU), the ECB also faces “extra-institutional overburdening.”
This became apparent in May 2010, when the ECB assumed the responsibility of purchasing the government bonds of countries that otherwise would have experienced substantial increases in long-term interest rates.
That intervention was a lose-lose proposition for the ECB.
It was essentially driven by politics: the ECB was picking up the slack for policymakers who were unwilling to fulfill their obligations.
But if the ECB had refused to intervene, financial markets could have faced substantial turmoil, for which, rightly or wrongly, it would have been blamed.
From that moment on, however, the ECB took on the political role of guaranteeing not only the survival of the euro, but also the continued inclusion of every EMU member country.
In 2012, ECB President Mario Draghi cemented this responsibility, pledging to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro.
“And believe me,” he asserted, “it will be enough.”
This stance led many to accuse the ECB of exceeding its mandate and violating European treaties.
But the European Court of Justice and the German Constitutional Court have, all in all, rejected that view.
Nonetheless, further litigation regarding the ECB’s unconventional monetary-policy measures is underway.
Against this background, it is perhaps unsurprising that central-bank independence – de jure or de facto – is once again up for debate.
The purpose of central-bank independence has always been to enable monetary policy to focus on maintaining price stability, without being subject to political pressure.
While this approach has always been controversial, given that it implies handing substantial control over the economy to unelected technocrats, past inflationary episodes have fostered broad acceptance of central-bank independence.
When central-bank mandates exceed price stability, however, their independence may seem increasingly out of place in a democratic society.
This is particularly true for the ECB: the stronger the perceived link between the extension of the ECB’s mandate and politics becomes, the more criticism its independent status will confront.
The failure of elected politicians to act appropriately – particularly in some eurozone countries – has turned central banks into the “only game in town.”
And this is turning out to be less a boon to their prestige than a threat to their independence.
The ECB, especially, is set to face growing pushback against its independent status, regardless of whether it manages to “save” the EMU.
After all, it would have to be quite powerful to succeed – too powerful for any democracy to abide.

Doubling Down on European Energy Efficiency
BRUSSELS – At the COP21 conference in Paris last December, world leaders made a binding pledge to set national targets, including energy-efficiency benchmarks, for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
Now, the European Commission is nearing a moment of truth: Will it set ambitious but attainable energy efficiency targets that will force individuals and industry to make real changes?
Or will it bend to political pressure and set meaningless targets that will be reached anyway, with no any additional effort?
The latter approach was taken in 2014, when European leaders agreed to improve energy efficiency by 27% before 2030.
The European Council was applauded at the time for its leadership.
Nobody bothered to mention that global energy efficiency was already likely to increase by around 35% on its own by 2030.
The COP21 agreement has given Europe a second chance to set an example and become the global standard-bearer for energy efficiency.
Environmentalists, business leaders, and academics are awaiting new targets from the European Commission, which will most likely be established in October, in a forthcoming revision to the Commission’s Energy Efficiency Directive.
So, what would be a meaningful target?
If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitment, they should embrace a 70% reduction on 2010 consumption levels by 2030 – more than double the European Council’s 2014 target.
A 70% reduction is ambitious, but not impossible.
There is both an economic and an environmental case to be made for it.
Economically, countries that reduce energy consumption also increase productivity, simply because using less energy costs less money.
While implementing energy-efficiency measures may require heavy initial investments, these outlays will be offset by future productivity growth, which is the only way developed countries can sustainably improve living standards over time.
The environmental argument for an ambitious target is not that we need to “save the Earth.” But we do need to save the climate in which humans have evolved and prospered.
Energy efficiency around the world is increasing at roughly 1.5% per year, which is a welcome development and a sign that 30 years of forward-leaning environmental policies have had some effect.
Global energy consumption, however, is rising at around 3% per year, implying that we’re still digging our hole deeper, rather than filling it in.
Six of the world’s largest economies – China, the United States, Russia, India, Japan, and the European Union – remain the biggest polluters.
But most growth today comes from developing countries that now participate in the global economy.
Even if these countries make significant strides in reducing emissions, they will be the polluters of the future, at least in the near term.
Globalization has increased life expectancy and improved living standards in many poor countries.
But it also poses new environmental problems that will require ambitious solutions.
Seen in this light, a 70% improvement in energy efficiency is the minimum Europe – and the world – can aim for to reach real sustainability at current levels of global growth.
Fortunately, this is all within our grasp.
A 2015 study published by Ecofys, Quintel Intelligence, and the Lisbon Council concluded that Europe already has the technologies available to double current energy-efficiency levels without sacrificing economic growth.
These include heat pumps, smart grids, LED lighting, and energy-efficient household equipment.
So why aren’t these technologies being implemented already?
The reason isn’t that industry is holding Europe back; on the contrary, European industry’s environmental footprint has improved considerably in recent years.
Rather, the principal energy consumer in Europe is individual households, where energy efficiency can be tripled in the coming years with the right political leadership, sufficient investment, and long-term commitment from Europeans themselves.
This takes us back to the Energy Efficiency Directive, where this work should begin.
The European Commission should set “moon-shot” standards that push us to higher achievements than we once thought possible.
If Europe can double its energy efficiency by 2030, Europeans will look back and wonder how they ever lived differently.

Who Can Beat Trump?
WASHINGTON, DC – The US presidential election in November is the most consequential in modern history.
Whether the increasingly authoritarian, vindictive, and dangerous Donald Trump wins another four years in power could define the US for a long time to come.
This year’s election will be no typical struggle between two parties that differ more in degree than in kind.
But first, the Democrats must select their candidate, and this time that contest is exceptionally fluid.
Former Vice President Joe Biden’s third attempt to win the country’s top job isn’t going much better than the first two.
Biden is a well-liked figure – a decent, empathetic man who lacks a mean streak.
But Biden’s very likability might well be his electoral undoing.
He lacks what I call presidentialness – a certain dignity and remoteness that conveys the sense that crossing him or her would be unwise.
He also lacks a message: reminding Democrats that he was Barack Obama’s vice president tells voters little about how he would govern.
Nor is it surprising that the air has gone out of Elizabeth Warren’s campaign.
At the outset, she responded to questions by saying, “I have a plan for that.” She’s knowledgeable about domestic government and has attracted a passionate following.
But she seemed not to grasp that enacting so many new programs would be impossible.
Several of her Senate colleagues – including allies – told me early on that she wouldn’t “wear well.”
They dislike her “holier-than-thou” attitude.
There’s a coldness to her that all the selfies with fans don’t quite overcome.
Senator Bernie Sanders, too, is a victim of over-promising.
He still does best among the youngest voters; most older voters question how he would pay for all his promises, including free tuition at public colleges and forgiveness of student debt.
Both Warren and Sanders have run into trouble with “Medicare for All,” universal health insurance.
No one has shown how replacing Obamacare with a single-payer system wouldn’t raise taxes on the middle class, and some unions oppose it because it would replace the better health-care plans they negotiated, having given up other benefits.
(Warren later adjusted her proposal, but not convincingly.)
Sanders, a self-proclaimed “democratic socialist,” is a worrisome figure at a time when party unity is seen as crucial to defeating Trump.
Sanders’s ideological rigidity limits his following, and so he has failed to grow his constituency.
Although he won New Hampshire, which borders his home state, Vermont, he won 50% fewer votes than in 2016.
But right now, he cannot be ruled out as a strong possibility for the nomination.
Helped by a political press looking for a new story and by a good debate performance four nights before the New Hampshire primary, Senator Amy Klobuchar turned a third-place finish there (she was fifth in Iowa) into a “surge.”
But debates are a poor indicator of a presidency: they test likeability, cleverness, and a vision, but they reveal little about candidates’ temperament, judgment, curiosity, wisdom, and diplomatic skill.
For now, Klobuchar’s bump has overshadowed her reputation for meanness in dealing with staff, which has caused difficulty in attracting and retaining top-tier aides.
But Klobuchar also lacks a vision. She recites an apparently impressive record of winning elections in Minnesota, where she hasn’t had strong opposition, and emphasizes her modest origins (her grandfather was a coal miner).
What she doesn’t point out is her corporate backing, including by the agribusiness giant Cargill, America’s largest privately held company – and one of the most controversial.
Pete Buttigieg, 38, has been the most surprising phenomenon in the contest, thanks to his sharp intellect and unusual composure.
His rivals deride his political experience as mayor of a small city (South Bend, Indiana), but that has familiarized him with how federal programs work.
He volunteered for the military and served in Afghanistan, and he’s given more thought to foreign policy than most of his rivals (except Biden).
He handles being a married gay man with aplomb.
He has a wry sense of humor and can subtly skewer an opponent in a way that recalls Obama.
But is that enough to win?
Bill Clinton projected empathy.
Americans saw Obama cry following the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in 2012.
It’s hard to imagine seeing Buttigieg cry.
He can come off as the reserved McKinsey planner he once was.
That, as much as controversial personnel decisions he took as mayor, may underlie his difficulty so far in attracting support from minority voters.
And while one can imagine Buttigieg’s sharp intellect and quick sense of humor unnerving Trump, it’s unknown whether the electorate as a whole would be as accepting of a gay candidate as Democratic voters are.
Once Mike Bloomberg, a three-term New York City mayor, rose in opinion polls, he began to get closer scrutiny – which has landed him in choppy waters.
For example, he has been accused of racism, essentially because of his “stop-and-frisk” program as mayor, and of misogyny in his business practices; vulgar statements he made before becoming mayor are now being circulated.
But Bloomberg has drawn upon his enormous wealth to self-finance his campaign and build important alliances by donating to candidates and offering training grants to mayors, most of them black, and helping women advance.
Moreover, Bloomberg’s governing experience and his calm competence make him attractive to many.
But his major draw is that he’s viewed as the best equipped to defeat Trump, who seems rattled by the prospect of facing a challenger who is far wealthier than he is (and evidently privy to his unseemly New York business practices).
To be able to buy political advantage may be unfair or wrong, but Trump is such an alarming figure that many voters so far appear willing to overlook what they would never forgive otherwise.
That’s because the 2020 election is being fought at a time of crisis for American democracy.

The Messiah of Mar-a-Lago
TEL AVIV – US President Donald Trump says he is “the chosen one,” and many of his evangelical supporters agree.
But standing, Bible in hand, in front of the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, DC, after the police used riot shields and tear gas to clear the area of peaceful protesters, Trump had more in common with Jesus Christ’s donkey than with a savior.
Far from liberating a fallen civilization, Trump is pushing one to its breaking point, creating precisely the kind of mayhem that many of his evangelical supporters believe will precede – and necessitate – the arrival of a messiah.
Trump ran for president in 2016 on the promise to “Make America Great Again.”
His campaign for re-election in November pledges, with all the clueless arrogance we have come to expect, to “Keep America Great.”
Is this the same America that is facing widespread protests over systemic racism and police brutality, and in which the law-enforcement officers who are supposed to keep the peace are routinely stoking violence?
The America where the police kill black men at 2.5 times the rate of white men?
Is Trump referring to the America that is in the throes of the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak, in which black people are dying at far higher rates than their white counterparts?
The America where about 44 million people have no health insurance, and another 38 million have inadequate coverage?
The one that, under Trump’s leadership, has lost the respect of its friends, allies, and partners, and become an international laughingstock?
To be sure, America’s problems did not begin with Trump.
The US health-care system has long been broken, inequality has been rising for decades, police brutality has always been part of American life, and systemic racism is built into the country’s very foundations.
US pretensions of moral leadership were being called into question well before Trump entered the White House.
But if the United States was a tinderbox of racism, inequality, and broken politics, Trump lit the match – and then held himself blameless for the resulting fires. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” he declared, when asked about the government’s slow response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Worse, Trump continued to add fuel. He downplayed the pandemic’s severity, egged on (mostly white, Republican) anti-lockdown protesters, and touted unproven and potentially dangerous treatments.
When nationwide protests erupted after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, he threatened to deploy the military against Americans, prompting four-star general John Allen to warn that such a move could signal the “beginning of the end of the American experiment.”
And, with a blatant racist dog whistle, he repeated a line attributed to Walter Headley, Miami’s police chief during the civil disorder there in 1967: “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”
Trump’s behavior has been shocking, but not surprising.
He has been exploiting America’s deepest flaws since he arrived on the political scene, stoking political and cultural polarization to appease his base, including its significant component of white supremacists.
Meanwhile, he has maintained his grip on the Republican Party with a conventional combination of tax cuts and deregulation that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.
And, for four consecutive years, his administration has shifted public money from the social safety net and education to the military.
The US defense budget is now the largest it has been since World War II, barring a handful of years at the height of the Iraq War.
Why, one might reasonably ask, is Trump arming America to the teeth?
After all, he has abdicated US global leadership and let China fill the vacuum without firing a single shot.
Not only has he abandoned diplomatic norms, dismissed and betrayed allies, and bullied countries with sanctions and threats. He has also withdrawn from international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal (officially, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) and the Paris climate agreement.
For Europeans – who disagreed with Trump on most of these decisions – the US is no longer a source of strategic or moral leadership.
It may not even be a fellow member of the transatlantic community.
Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent rebuff of Trump’s invitation to a G7 summit shows how far relations have fallen.
Only desperate cynics like Israel’s Binyamin Netanyahu, evangelical liars like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, poseurs like Britain’s Boris Johnson, and bullies like the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte still relish Trump’s friendship.
There is only one way to repair America’s reputation, regain the trust of allies, and ensure that the US can act as an effective counterweight to China: address the root causes of the cracks that Trump’s disastrous presidency has exposed and widened.
This is in line with the vision advanced in 2011 by two military strategists, Captain Wayne Porter and Colonel Mark Mykleby, using the pseudonym “Mr. Y.”
Porter and Mykleby argued that national security depends not only on the capacity to respond to threats from foreign powers, but also – and perhaps more important – on the “application of credible influence and strength.”
That influence, in turn, depends on America’s success in providing a “pathway of promise” for US citizens – and a model for the world.
Such soft power requires the US government to promote civilian values, foster competitiveness and innovation, protect the environment, invest in social services, health care, culture, and education, and deliver opportunities to younger generations.
In other words, it should be pursuing the opposite of Trump’s agenda.
Trump is the antithesis of the kind of leader that Max Weber believed should “be allowed to put his hand on the wheel of history.”
A large and growing share of Americans seems to recognize this: his approval rating has been declining for weeks.
But a Trump victory in the November election remains a real possibility.
No one should have any illusions about the stakes.
Winning another four-year term could embolden Trump to act even more irresponsibly, even criminally, and make his toxic legacy irreversible.

Trump, to Jerusalem and Back
TEL AVIV – US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger famously singled out Israel as a country whose entire foreign policy is actually domestic.
Yet the same is true of the United States, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
All US presidents attempting to resolve that conflict have faced massive – indeed, insurmountable – domestic political obstacles.
With his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Donald Trump has taken this trend to the next level, though the result may well be more of the same stagnation.
Trump’s Jerusalem declaration is the latest manifestation of the unlikely president’s quest for domestic legitimacy, which has made him almost obsessed with fulfilling his extreme and self-defeating campaign promises, including withdrawal from or renegotiation of major international treaties such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement.
Likewise, the Jerusalem decision was meant to appease the messianic dreams of his massive evangelical constituency.
Yet Trump’s actions have wider diplomatic implications, which he seems incapable of calculating.
Understandably, Trump’s declaration has been met with rage from Palestinians, with President Mahmoud Abbas asserting that “from now on” he would not accept “any role” for the US in the peace process, and even calling for the world to reconsider its recognition of Israel.
Moreover, anti-American powers – Hezbollah, Iran, Russia, and Turkey – have taken Trump’s divisive decision as an opportunity to enhance their own regional influence, at the expense of the US and its allies.
They hope to position themselves as the champions of a great Arab and Muslim cause supposedly betrayed by the feeble reaction of Israel’s newfound Arab friends, particularly Saudi Arabia.
This response won’t help the Palestinians any more than it will help the US.
Anger is not a strategy – a lesson that Palestinians have learned the hard way in the past.
Abbas is presumably also still waiting for the United Kingdom to apologize for the 1917 Balfour declaration, the centenary of which Israel recently celebrated.
The fact is that, despite being demoralized by years of futile “peace processes,” the Palestinian masses are in no mood for a third intifada.
And they blame their plight not just on the occupier, but also on their own unelected and utterly unpopular leaders, who offer them no sense of direction or achievable objectives.
The incendiary rhetoric of Palestine’s supporters in the Arab world has never done much for the Palestinian people, either.
Trump’s Jerusalem declaration is not “the beginning of the end of Israel,” as Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has promised.
Hezbollah is simply attempting to distract attention from its disgraceful war in support of Bashar al-Assad’s genocidal regime in Syria.
Likewise, by committing itself to the Palestinian “Islamic Resistance Forces,” Hezbollah’s patron, Iran, is simply recycling a policy that it has pursued since long before that declaration, with the goal of advancing its regional hegemonic designs.
And, in fact, while the move has probably reinforced Iran’s claim to be the true defender of Jerusalem and Palestine, the biggest gains for Iran will likely be emotional.
After all, the Sunni Middle East – led by a Saudi Arabia for which the quest for regional dominance amounts to a struggle for regime survival – will not accept being led by the rising Shia empire, especially if that means clashing head-on with Israel and the US.
Palestine also should not expect much from Russia.
President Vladimir Putin is a realist; he knows that heeding the call for Russia to assume a leadership role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would damage his relationships with both parties, without bringing them any closer to a settlement.
Russia’s calling is not – and has never been – that of a peacemaker.
So, in many ways, Trump’s Jerusalem declaration will not change much.
As the Palestinians and their friends in the international community might realize when the dust settles, it does not preclude the city’s eventual division into two capitals as part of a peace settlement, much less guarantee Israel sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as its “eternal capital.”
In fact, it is a fantasy to assume, as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu seems to do, that Trump’s support is the key to getting the Palestinians and their Arab and Muslim supporters to acquiesce to Israeli-Jewish rule over a city that is so important to both sides.
Even Trump himself admitted the limits of Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem, and affirmed his commitment to the status quo regarding East Jerusalem’s holy sites.
Moreover, the restrained response of Arab leaders should not be interpreted as a vindication of Netanyahu’s assumption that his newfound allies in Saudi Arabia and Egypt could force the Palestinians into a US-brokered peace deal that would not meet the core requirements of their national narrative.
In any case, the days of Netanyahu’s expansionist government are numbered.
The clumsy Jerusalem declaration cannot save Netanyahu’s current coalition government from massive corruption scandals and irreconcilable internal conflicts.
Not even an Israel-friendly peace plan spearheaded by Trump (assuming his declaration does not foreclose it altogether) could do that.
Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition simply is no partner for a historic deal, on Jerusalem or on any other element of the dispute.
The only way forward is for Israel to produce a new, more centrist coalition, while the Palestinians adopt a more sober and strategic approach.
In that case, Trump’s Jerusalem declaration would not preclude a solution according to the peace parameters put forward by Bill Clinton.
And, in fact, when I led the Israeli negotiating team almost two decades ago, both sides accepted the idea of Jerusalem being partitioned, albeit with flexible borders, along ethnic lines.
To improve the chances of success, America’s monopoly on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process should end.
Instead, the negotiations should be handled more like those that produced the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, with a group of countries – in that case, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US), plus Germany – working together to achieve results.

The Drug Industry’s Poison Pills
BOSTON – One does not need to spend a lifetime in the global health-care sector to appreciate that substandard or counterfeit drugs are a major public-health hazard.
These bogus products have infiltrated pharmaceutical supply chains from Azerbaijan to Zambia, wrecking the most promising programs to control, manage, and eradicate deadly diseases.
Yet little is being done to stop this criminal activity.
Growing up in Pakistan, I realized how vital it was for my mother, like any educated parent, to know which drugs and pharmacies could be trusted.
Little has changed since then.
Local pharmacists from Lahore to Lusaka continue to sell a variety of brands of the same drug at different prices; and shopkeepers are called upon to give a candid opinion of their benefits and shortcomings.
Unfortunately, the problem runs a lot deeper than a few bad drugs sold at the corner pharmacy.
Around $75 billion of substandard drugs are sold annually, causing an estimated 100,000 deaths worldwide, and making many more people seriously ill.
The trade in inferior drugs also undermines fragile public-health systems in poor countries.
As well as killing consumers, the effects of bad drugs can be passed from parent to child, and even create new drug-resistant strains of diseases that threaten us all.
Yet the fight against substandard drugs has never been taken as seriously as other global health crises such as malaria, HIV, or maternal and infant mortality.
This may be because there is no obvious solution.
But, in seeking answers, we must first acknowledge that the issue is larger than just counterfeit medicines.
Many legitimate manufacturers worldwide, whether through complacency or incompetence, lack adequate quality controls.
In some cases, deficient storage and refrigeration systems turn safe medicines into dangerous substances.
Unfortunately, those drug makers then take advantage of developing countries’ weak or poorly implemented legislation and corrupt officials to pass their products through local supply chains and into shops.
Public ignorance or apathy means that those responsible are able to avoid prosecution.
The technical expertise and equipment needed to detect inferior products is usually beyond the financial reach of many developing countries.
But there are low-cost alternatives.
One approach, for example, would be to include on packaging a “scratch code” that includes a phone number for consumers to call in order to check that the batch number matches an authentic product.
But, while this approach would certainly help to catch counterfeits, it would miss the substandard or degraded products made by legitimate firms, which are tested only by the consumer – and often at great cost in terms of health risks.
It is therefore imperative to develop new detection technologies that will work in poorer countries, and that complement existing systems such as bar codes.
Detection technology must be capable of analyzing all forms of a drug – whether powder, pill, capsule, or syrup – and of detecting several different grades of quality, not just the junk.
It must be simple, affordable, adaptable, and scalable; and it must work at all stages of distribution, whether at customs, in hospitals, or in remote villages.
But technology alone will not be enough.
Regulators, hospitals, and drug-safety authorities must take the lead, rather than placing the burden on often poor and uneducated citizens who are struggling to care for loved ones.
The search for new, sustainable solutions, requires at least three initiatives.
First, we must encourage innovation by offering research grants to support small initiatives or large-scale projects (like campaigns to fight HIV, malaria, and maternal mortality).
Ideally, an international group would coordinate and develop all of the ideas and products, and take them from the laboratory to the field.
Second, we need to harness the creativity and commitment of young students, so that they understand the devastating impact of bad pharmaceuticals and become motivated to make a difference in people’s lives.
Third, we must make use of the media.
Just as the world cries foul when an illegal shipment of ivory is uncovered, we must launch campaigns in the press, on television, and online to bring to account any trader, state official, or company caught selling or promoting low-quality drugs.
In this way, we will remind those in the industry of a fundamental premise: their most precious commodity is not a blockbuster drug, but the public’s trust.
If drug makers and pharmacists cannot protect their customers’ health, they cannot protect their business.

The Brexit Alarm
LONDON – As a passionate European, the outcome of Britain’s referendum on European Union membership horrified me. It will almost certainly result in our exit from the EU.
But I have feared for many years that large-scale immigration to the UK would produce a harmful populist response.
Global elites must now learn and act upon the crucial lesson of “Brexit.”
Contrary to glib assumptions, globalization of capital, trade, and migration flows is not “good for everyone.”
If we do not address its adverse effects, Brexit will not be the last – or the worst – consequence.
Net immigration to Britain was close to zero in the early 1990s.
It began to increase later that decade, and grew rapidly after eight formerly communist countries joined the EU in 2004, when Britain – unlike, for instance, France and Germany – waived its right to impose a seven-year delay before allowing free movement of people from the new member states.
Last year, net immigration was 333,000, and the total population grew by around 500,000.
Credible forecasts suggest that the UK’s population, now 64 million, could be above 80 million by mid-century.
Migration undoubtedly brings many benefits – London is a wonderful city partly because it is a cosmopolitan melting pot of diverse cultures.
But, as the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, of which I was then a member, argued as early as 2008, large-scale immigration has brought significant disadvantages for many people.
The precise impact of migration on wages is hotly debated among economists, but no economy can face a sudden surge in labor supply without some adverse consequences for at least some groups of “native” workers.
A sudden surge in population, often concentrated in particular locations, will also produce overcrowding in key public services, such as education and health care, unless offset by a well-planned and well-financed surge in public investment.
In the UK, that investment did not occur.
In England – which vies with the Netherlands for the highest population density in Europe – many fear that further population growth will mean unwelcome pressure on much-loved countryside.
This has provoked intense local opposition to major new infrastructure development, with endless delay, increased cost, or lasting resentment the inevitable result.
For all these reasons, increased migration to the UK was bound to produce a political reaction.
That reaction partly reflected xenophobia, fanned by deliberate exaggeration: “Leave” campaigners, for example, mendaciously suggested that Turkey, with its large and rapidly expanding population, would soon enter the EU without Britain’s consent.
But the lies were effective because they built on a kernel of truth, and because refusing to recognize that truth only intensified the populist reaction.
Indeed, faced with emerging concerns about migration, establishment politicians and academic economists responded either by dismissing the concerns as closet racism, or by denying that adverse consequences even existed; either way, millions of citizens were apparently suffering from false consciousness.
But if at least some people are suffering from real problems, lectures about the benefits of migration will only enrage them more.
The failure of the UK’s “Remain” campaign to rebut concerns about migration reflects the wider inability of the global elite to convince people that the free movement of capital, goods, and people is in general good for everyone. In fact, it isn’t, and good economics tells us why.
According to economic theory, each of these three freedoms can increase the size of the global pie.
But economic theory also tells us that there will inevitably be losers as well as winners, so that liberalization and globalization will be good for everyone only if the winners compensate the losers.
Around the world, there has been precious little compensation.
In the US, the main future challenge probably will be the impact of trade, rather than migration, because the era of large-scale influxes from Latin America may soon come to an end, as declining fertility rates stabilize populations throughout the region.
Paradoxically, US presidential candidate Donald Trump has managed to excite support for his absurd plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico at the very moment when net migration from Mexico is turning negative.
But his argument that many US workers have suffered – and could suffer still more – from free trade has struck a chord, because it is partly true.
Unless the US political system can produce effective policy responses to this reality, the populist rejection of free trade, combined with antagonism toward immigrants, seems likely to grow stronger.
In Europe, by contrast, the huge challenge in the future will be migration, and not so much within the EU as from outside.
According to the United Nations, Africa’s population could increase from 1.2 billion today to more than 4.3 billion by 2100.
Unless this increase is accompanied by rising prosperity and rapidly expanding job opportunities, large and continuous migration flows across the Mediterranean will become inevitable.
The whole of Europe therefore faces two enormous challenges: helping to foster economic development in Africa and the Middle East, and coping as best as possible with the significant migration flows which are bound to occur, with significant adverse consequences for some citizens.
Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated European response, and I greatly regret that Britain will now play a much-reduced role in shaping common European endeavors.
If any good can come from this depressing result, it is that a wake-up call has been heard, alerting us to the downsides of globalization.
Unless those downsides are acknowledged and addressed, the backlash that fueled Brexit will continue to grow.

Building the India-US Partnership
WASHINGTON, DC – President Barack Obama’s first presidential visit to India offers a unique opportunity to cement a global partnership with a rapidly emerging power.
Set to become the world’s third or fourth largest economy by 2030, India could become America’s most important strategic partner.
In coming decades, a strong bilateral partnership will prove vital in managing the rise of China and promoting an Asian balance of power that is favorable to India, the United States, and Asia as a whole.
India’s success as a democracy also strengthens freedom globally and protects broader American interests.
Yet, as many observers have noted, US-India relations have recently become listless and marked by drift.
Both countries are to blame.
Obama has understandably focused on competing priorities, including the troubled US economy and ongoing wars abroad.
India’s government has been similarly occupied with domestic political struggles and the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising pressure for redistribution.
Moreover, Indian officials must still nurture the small, albeit growing, constituency that supports a rapidly transformed relationship with the US.
This trip provides a great opportunity for both sides to reinvigorate a critical relationship.
For its part, the Obama administration should take a number of steps to reaffirm its support for India’s rise, its democratic achievements, and its struggle for security.
Notably, the US should reaffirm its support for a larger Indian role in international organizations and help integrate India into the global non-proliferation regime.
In this context, the Obama administration should endorse India’s quest for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
Obama should also support India’s membership in key non-proliferation organizations like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime.
India, too, must do its part.
It can begin by creating greater opportunities for US firms – including from the nuclear industry – to invest in India’s economic success.
It can expand defense cooperation beyond purchases of American-made military equipment by deepening its diplomatic engagement with the US to help find solutions to the difficult problems stemming from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.
In short, India’s government should look for ways to sustain America’s interest in India during difficult times.
Both countries should consolidate their cooperation in other areas already agreed upon: agriculture, education, health care, energy, and science and technology.
Obama’s trip offers an opportunity for taking stock, expanding initiatives that have matured, and announcing new projects that will provide global benefits.
The latter include developing an international food security initiative, cooperating to increase vocational training in fragile states, expanding clean-energy research, investing in global disease-detection systems, and collaborating to explore shale-gas extraction.
In addition, the US and India should create innovation partnerships, which would not only yield direct returns to both countries, but would also demonstrate how a strong bilateral relationship can improve the international system.
The US and India should expand cooperation on other multilateral issues as well.
The global economic crisis and new fears of US protectionism have motivated India to rethink its attitude toward the Doha Development Round.
If Obama can weather domestic resistance to new international trade negotiations and modify America’s current position on sectoral tariff reduction by developing countries, the US and India will have an opportunity to break the impasse that has stymied the Doha Round’s successful conclusion.
Ultimately, a strong US-Indian partnership is in both countries’ strategic interest.
Their societies are already intertwined – and will be even more so in the future – by various personal, economic, and social links.
Moreover, Obama should resist the urge to approach the bilateral relationship purely in transactional terms, but instead should seek to strengthen India’s long-term capacity to be a productive partner with the US.
In short, Obama ought not to ask, “What will India do for us?”, but rather, “Is a strong, democratic and independent India in America’s national interest?” If the answer to this question is yes – as it should be – then the US should focus on how it can help India’s power continue to grow.
By reaffirming the US commitment to aid India’s rise, and by emphasizing America’s fellowship with India, Obama can help bring the two countries together on the basis of shared interests, and move their relationship forward significantly.
That effort must start now.

White House Sex Crimes
NEW YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature, even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States.
How extraordinary, then, to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes, Condoleezza Rice, has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison.
Even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of “a few bad apples” low in the military hierarchy, I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top.
It’s not that I am a genius. It’s simply that, having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime, I have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recognizable ways.
We now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Rice – who actually chaired the torture meetings.
The Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives.
And documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld, in his own words, “checking in” on the sexualized humiliation of prisoners.
The sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex-crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US-held prisoners.
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture, it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this.
The nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation, electrodes attached to genitals, and forced sleep deprivation, to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced.
These abuses violate both US and international law.
Three former military attorneys, recognizing this blunt truth, refused to participate in the “military tribunals” – rather, “show trials” – aimed at condemning men whose confessions were elicited through torture.
Though we can now debate what the penalty for water-boarding should be, America as a nation, maintaining an odd silence, still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved.
Why?
It’s not as if the sex crimes that US leaders either authorized or tolerated are not staring Americans in the face: the images of male prisoners with their heads hooded with women’s underwear; the documented reports of female US soldiers deployed to smear menstrual blood on the faces of male prisoners, and of military interrogators or contractors forcing prisoners to simulate sex with each other, to penetrate themselves with objects, or to submit to being penetrated by objects.
Indeed, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse.
There is also the testimony by female soldiers such as Lynndie England about compelling male prisoners to masturbate, as well as an FBI memo objecting to a policy of “highly aggressive interrogation techniques.” The memo cites a female interrogator rubbing lotion on a shackled detainee and whispering in his ear – during Ramadan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive – then suddenly bending back his thumbs until he grimaced in pain, and violently grabbing his genitals.
Sexual abuse in US-operated prisons got worse and worse over time, ultimately including, according to doctors who examined detainees, anal sodomy.
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person, but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders.
Those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim, they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior. Abusers start by undressing their victims, but once that line has been breached, you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and anal penetration, greater and greater pain and fear being inflicted, and more and more carelessness about exposing the crimes as the perpetrator’s inhibitions fall away.
The perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever-escalating rationalizations, often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good.
Finally, the victim is blamed for the abuse: in the case of the detainees, if they would only “behave,” and confess, they wouldn’t bring all this on themselves.
Silence, and even collusion, is also typical of sex crimes within a family.
Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence.
Just as sex criminals – and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy – were tried and sentenced after the wars in Bosnia and Sierra Leone, so Americans must hold accountable those who committed, or authorized, sex crimes in US-operated prisons.
Throughout the world, this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power.
These acts need to be called by their true names – war crimes and sex crimes – and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims.
As in a family, only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assault can the healing begin.

Pakistan’s War at Home
SINGAPORE – Last month, after years of indecision, Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale military operation in the North Waziristan Tribal Agency aimed at eliminating terrorist bases and ending the region’s lawlessness.
In particular, the army wants to clear out foreign fighters who are using the territory as a base for various jihads around the Muslim world.
But, by triggering yet another refugee crisis, the operation risks spreading the terrorist threat to other parts of Pakistan, including its largest city and commercial center, Karachi.
Operating from sanctuaries established in the tribal agency, various terrorist groups, in association with organizations elsewhere in the country, have already attacked Pakistan’s four neighbors – Afghanistan, China, India, and Iran.
Of the region’s foreign fighters, Uzbeks belonging to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan have recently become the most visible threat, taking responsibility for the June 8-9 attack on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, in which 30 people, including all ten of the militants, were killed.
In launching the North Waziristan operation, General Raheel Sharif, Pakistan’s new Chief of Army Staff, stated that his forces would draw no distinction between supposedly “good” and “bad” Taliban.
The former, including the Haqqanis – named after Jalaluddin Haqqani, who led the Islamic resistance against Soviet forces in Afghanistan – had been trained and equipped by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan’s main security agency.
Following the United States’ invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Haqqanis created a sanctuary in the North Waziristan Tribal Agency.
The ISI countenanced this in the hope that the Pashtun group would later act as Pakistan’s proxies in Afghanistan after US combat troops depart at the end of 2014.
But the Haqqanis, it appears, did not keep to any such bargain, and allowed their Uzbek guests in North Waziristan to launch the Karachi airport attack.
This conflict, however, will not be easy to contain or manage.
Pashtuns, the main ethnic group on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, are engaged in a bitter struggle in both countries to assert what they consider to be their legitimate political and economic rights.
Karachi, hundreds of miles to the south, will not escape the fallout from the North Waziristan operation.
The military, which planned to flush out the main militant hideouts with air strikes, and then send in ground troops, instructed residents to leave the area beforehand.
Some 350,000 people have already fled, creating a humanitarian crisis on a scale similar to that in 2009 when the military broke the Taliban’s grip on the Swat Valley.
The movement of so many people is likely to have a profound effect on Pakistan.
According to a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, released just five days after the assault, at the end of 2013 there were 51.2 million forcibly displaced people in the world, six million more than the year before, and the largest number since World War II.
Pakistan plays host to more refugees than any other country, with 1.5 million registered in the country, in addition to an estimated 3.5 million internally displaced people.
As has been the case on previous occasions, internally displaced people from North Waziristan are unlikely to remain in the camps set up for them in adjoining districts.
Many will head for Pakistan’s large cities, particularly Karachi.
The city’s population of 20 million already includes around six million Pashtuns, more than the number in Kabul and Peshawar combined.
Indeed, Karachi is sometimes called an “instant city,” having grown 50-fold as a result of several waves of migration since Pakistan gained independence in 1947.
The first wave, of around two million people, arrived in Karachi when eight million Muslims fled India for Pakistan.
The second wave included Pashtun construction workers who helped build the new commercial capital.
The third wave comprised refugees displaced during Afghanistan’s war against Soviet occupation.
And the fourth began in the early 2000s, following the US invasion of Afghanistan, which also gave rise to Pashtun resistance on both sides of the border, and contributed in turn to Islamic extremism in the tribal areas.
The current displacement from North Waziristan, therefore, can be seen as part of this fourth wave.
Even if the army succeeds in clearing out the militants, some of the internally displaced people, bearing battle scars, will end up in Karachi.
They will be in no mood to lay down their arms if the municipal authorities fail to develop inclusive political institutions that give minority ethnic groups a fair political voice.
In that case, the long-term consequence of the military’s North Waziristan campaign may well be more violence where it can cause the most damage.

Antarctica’s Point of No Return
POTSDAM – Recent satellite observations have confirmed the accuracy of two independent computer simulations that show that the West Antarctic ice sheet has now entered a state of unstoppable collapse.
The planet has entered a new era of irreversible consequences from climate change.
The only question now is whether we will do enough to prevent similar developments elsewhere.
What the latest findings demonstrate is that crucial parts of the world’s climate system, though massive in size, are so fragile that they can be irremediably disrupted by human activity.
It is inevitable that the warmer the world gets, the greater the risk that other parts of the Antarctic will reach a similar tipping point; in fact, we now know that the Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica, as big or even bigger than the ice sheet in the West, could be similarly vulnerable.
There are not many human activities whose impact can reasonably be predicted decades, centuries, or even millennia in advance.
The fallout from nuclear waste is one; humans’ contribution to global warming through greenhouse-gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, and its impact on rising sea levels, is another.
Indeed, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report stated, in uncharacteristically strong terms, that the sea level is “virtually certain” to continue to rise in the coming centuries or millennia.
Moreover, the greater our emissions, the higher the seas will rise.
But the recent revelations about Antarctica are different.
Rather than reacting to global warming with gradual and predictable patterns of change, the West Antarctic ice sheet has suddenly “tipped” into a new state.
A relatively small amount of melting beneath the Amundsen Sea’s ice shelf has pushed its grounding line to the top of a sub-glacial hill, from which it is now “rolling down.”
Simply put, one thermal kick was enough to initiate an internal dynamic that will now continue under its own momentum, regardless of any action that humans might take to prevent it.
It is not completely clear whether humans have caused this tipping – though nothing like it has ever occurred during the 11,500-year Holocene period before humans started interfering with the planet’s energy balance.
But that is not the point.
What is important is that we recognize the existence of gigantic parts of the earth’s climate system – such as West Antarctica’s three-quadrillion-ton ice sheet – that can be tipped when a fractional temperature rise occurs in key locations.
This risk is no longer merely theoretical.
For the first time, findings based on observations and computer simulations all point to the same conclusion: the huge Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica has begun an irreversible ice discharge, and nothing can now halt the subsequent drainage of the entire basin.
It has passed the point of no return.
That is why we must now focus on similar topographic conditions elsewhere.
If an “ice plug” near the coast of Wilkes Basin melts or breaks off into icebergs, the basin’s huge quantities of water will drain into the ocean.
Although no one knows precisely what might destabilize the Wilkes Basin, we can be fairly certain that further global warming, caused by greenhouse-gas emissions, will increase the risk.
The fact that sea levels will continue to rise is now clear.
But we can still determine how high and how fast levels rise by controlling the degree of global warming that we cause.
Climate change is caused by mankind, so the good news is that mankind can stop it by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.
Although West Antarctica’s fate is sealed, we may still be able to prevent the collapse of East Antarctica’s marine ice sheet.
That means deciding – sooner rather than later – which path to follow.
The current path risks further destabilization in Antarctica; choosing the alternative path of a new energy system for the planet is our last best hope.
