Sharon’s Triumph
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s disabling stroke has thrown Israeli politics into turmoil yet again.
Or so it seems.
Sharon was considered a certain victor in the planned March elections, for which he had organized his own Kadima (Forward) party, attracting leading figures from the Labor party on the left and the Likud party on the right.
But will his departure from public life really be as destabilizing as many observers suggest?
To be sure, it was Sharon’s personal appeal that made Kadima so popular.
His conservative and nationalist credentials sustained his popularity on the right, while his new security strategy – including full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip – attracted supporters from the left.
In short, Sharon was the ideal center candidate: a leader who reconciled a dovish approach with a hawkish outlook.
Yet Sharon’s untimely departure has by no means reversed the fundamental political and strategic shifts that he initiated.
In the short term, while Kadima will get fewer votes without Sharon at the helm, some voters will be swayed by sympathy for the stricken leader.
Indeed, polls show that the party could still finish first.
Moreover, Kadima still has an impressive triumvirate at the top of its list.
Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, a veteran political maverick and former mayor of Jerusalem, inspired several of Sharon’s initiatives.
Shimon Peres, a former prime minister and Labor party leader, appeals to many voters from the left.
Former chief of staff and defense minister Shaul Mufaz provides the security expertise.
Their differences will be harder to patch up without Sharon, but they have closed ranks and could well lead Kadima to victory.
At the same time, the main alternative candidates on the left and right have positioned themselves too far toward the extremes to recapture the center easily.
On the left is Amir Peretz of the Labor party, a populist and trade-union federation leader with little national leadership experience and even less familiarity with security matters.
Many Israelis distrust his ability to lead the country.
It had generally been expected that Labor would come in second in the election and form a coalition government with Kadima.
Without Sharon, Peretz might have more leverage in the partnership, particularly since Olmert has been more willing than Sharon to embrace policy changes perceived as dovish.
A Kadima-Labor coalition would have its problems, but it would still form the basis of a solid government.
On the right is Bibi Netanyahu, a former prime minister and leader of Sharon’s old Likud party.
A year ago, Netanyahu seemed certain to succeed Sharon.
But his opposition to the Gaza Strip withdrawal, coupled with his strong criticism of Sharon, cost him his position as heir apparent.
To gain control of the rump Likud, Netanyahu had to move sharply to the right.
In the longer term, Netanyahu may again rise to the top in a post-Sharon era, if he is able to regain the center.
But in the upcoming elections, he is likely to be left out in the cold.
More importantly, continuity on the political front is likely to extend to strategy and policy.
Sharon embodied a new national consensus, accepted by at least two-thirds of the population, that reflects deep-seated changes in the country and its situation.
From the left comes the idea that, in return for full peace, Israel is ready to withdraw from most of the territory captured in 1967 and accept a Palestinian state.
From the right, the consensus acknowledges that currently there is no Palestinian partner for real peace.
The left’s advocacy of territorial withdrawal gained currency as a result of a general recognition that holding onto land, especially Palestinian-populated areas, is not in the national interest.
Israel does not intend to claim this land in the future, never derived any economic benefit from it, and now regards staying there as a security problem rather than an asset.
With the Cold War over, the USSR gone, and the Arab world weakened, a conventional war with the armies of Arab states is no longer likely, rendering obsolete the strategic considerations underlying Israel’s occupation of this territory.
At the same time, though, there is no hesitation about waging a tough defensive war against Palestinian terrorism.
Israel will complete its defensive security fence and strike back against terrorists and those who fire missiles at Israeli civilian targets.
No one believes that Palestinian leader Abu Mazin can or will do anything to stop such attacks.
Indeed, it is understood on both the left and the right that he and his colleagues will not live up to any commitment they make.
The Palestinian movement is falling apart, the radicals are gaining control, and nobody is going to make peace.
The bad news, then, is that the conflict will go on for decades, owing to intransigence and growing chaos on the Palestinian side.
The good news is that Israel can defend itself with relatively low casualties, its economy is improving, and tourism is recovering.
As Palestinian extremism and anarchy become clearer, Israel’s stance may gain greater international sympathy, strengthening prospects for better relations with the Arab world and the West.
It was Sharon who sensed a sea change in Israeli sentiment and acted upon it.
But Sharon was the messenger, not the message.
The era of Israeli pragmatism that he opened will not end with his departure.

Strengthening Africa’s Best Pandemic Defense
PARIS – COVID-19 is having a devastating impact on the global economy.
Like every continent, Africa has been bracing itself for a sharp economic downturn.
Yet, despite the inevitable recession, the pandemic has created a unique opportunity to promote the growth of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) on the African continent.
Indeed, empowering the continent’s SMEs could limit the pandemic’s long-term economic fallout.
By creating the right environment for young entrepreneurs and start-ups to scale innovative solutions that are emerging from the crisis, African countries have a chance to stimulate job creation.
This is crucial on a continent where youth employment stands at 16%, and 10-12 million young people enter the workforce every year.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, young entrepreneurs and SMEs have been actively involved in developing innovations to combat the potential effects of the virus on African countries.
From the “Solar Wash,” a sun-powered, touch-free water dispenser in Ghana, to triage tools in Nigeria and the “DiagnoseMe” COVID-19 remote screening platform in Burkina Faso, young Africans are conceiving ingenious local solutions to help prevent the spread of the disease.
Africa’s SMEs have shown their flexibility and adaptability.
For example, in Kenya, a local textile factory was transformed into a surgical mask assembly line within a week.
In Senegal, the Institut Pasteur de Dakar developed a prototype for a ten-minute COVID-19 diagnostic test.
If commercialized and scaled up, such innovations could create more employment.
One example is in the pharmaceutical field.
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 16 million jobs are forfeited by importing pharmaceutical products worth $14 billion.
The surgical mask factory in Kenya already employs 400 workers, including 320 women, and plans to use the proceeds the sales revenue to open two more facilities.
The Institut Pasteur de Dakar has formed a partnership with a British biotech company to obtain international certification.
Mass production likely will lead to new hires of young Senegalese men and women.
Properly resourced, these innovations could support manufacturing industries that would strengthen Africa’s defenses against COVID-19 and create long-term sustainable businesses offering stable jobs.
In addition to ensuring access to start-up capital, governments should create a transparent and reliable regulatory environment that facilitates entrepreneurship and encourages investors.
Access to capital is probably the most significant challenge for African SMEs.
While many global institutions already provide capital, local sources should play a more significant role in supporting SME growth.
The Institut Pasteur de Dakar obtained seed funding for its COVID-19 testing kit from the British government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
DiagnoseMe receives funding from the United Nations Capital Development Fund.
But most global partners find it difficult to work with SMEs with more modest needs.
At the national level, several African governments have created COVID-19 funds to fight the disease and have invited philanthropists and businesses to contribute.
While most funds will focus on strengthening health-care systems and providing assistance to their societies’ most vulnerable members, some will be designated for job creation and economic recovery.
One of the best ways to do this is to provide micro-funding to new businesses, thereby enabling SMEs to invest and grow.
To be sure, corporate donors on the continent are answering the call.
In South Africa, business owners have contributed close to $150 million to the government’s Solidarity Fund.
In Nigeria, CEOs of large companies will fund medical equipment and fully equipped medical tents.
But business leaders can do more.
Early-stage funding, seed capital, and mentoring workshops for young innovators are other ways to boost entrepreneurship.
Similarly, pan-African programs, such as the one run by the Tony Elumelu Foundation, should ramp up their efforts.
Ensuring that the continent’s SMEs have access to the capital and expertise they need is critical to combating COVID-19 effectively.
African-owned solutions that are adapted to local conditions and create valuable employment opportunities may be the key to mitigating the pandemic’s economic impact.
There is even reason to hope that difficult conditions will yield unexpected gems.

Too Big to Reform?
LONDON – The best journalism, it is said, is the first draft of history.
Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin is certainly worthy of that designation.
As a bit player in the dramatic events that Sorkin describes (I am an independent director of Morgan Stanley in my spare time), I can confirm that he accurately captures the atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty that reigned in New York in the autumn of 2008.
It was a time when the tectonic plates of the financial system seemed to be shifting beneath us.
Institutions that had been seen as Rocks of Gibraltar were revealed to be smoking volcanoes, at risk of imminent dissolution into lava and ash.
Even Goldman Sachs continued to exist only thanks to the kind attentions of the United States Federal Reserve.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the British government found itself to be the proud owner of over 80% of Royal Bank of Scotland, which, according to some measures, had for a while been the world’s largest bank.
The experience was a lesson for banks, regulators, central banks, and treasuries, which, not surprisingly, were unprepared to handle a comprehensive crisis.
Their tools and powers were lacking.
The overriding conclusion that emerges from any analysis of these unhappy events is that nothing will ever be the same again: the relationship between the state and the markets needs to be rethought.
A new “social contract” between finance and the people, through their governments, is required.
That is easy to say, but governments, individually and collectively, are still struggling to redefine the terms of that contract.
Progress has been painfully slow, partly because officials have been fire-fighting, and partly because urgent domestic political imperatives compete with the desire to establish new, globally applicable mechanisms that would provide a stable underpinning for the international financial system and prevent regulatory arbitrage and the de-globalization of finance.
As a result, we are seeing different national regulatory approaches emerge.
In the US, the key driver of the biggest institutions’ decision-making is the Fed’s stress tests, which essentially assumed that everything that could go wrong would go wrong.
In Switzerland, the leverage ratio is now central.
Elsewhere, various versions of the Basel 1 and Basel 2 accords on international banking standards are in operation, sometimes with ad hoc supplements.
A new global Financial Stability Board is trying to make sense of all this, and also to work out a new “macro-prudential mechanism” reflecting system-wide risks.
But it has no formal authority to mandate a common approach to capital (the G-20 should give it one).
There is not much more progress to report on the too-big-to-fail problem itself.
What should be done about the mammoths of the financial jungle – some of which were conjured into being by governments themselves in the heat of the crisis?
Sorkin’s book reminds us that only 18 months ago, the US administration saw one answer in the creation of bigger and bigger banks, on the shaky argument that lashing two sinking ships together would somehow make them both seaworthy.
The British government did the same, acting as midwife to the Lloyds-Halifax Bank of Scotland combine, now widely seen to have been a major error.
It is no secret that there are deep divisions among public authorities on this question.
In the red corner, so to speak, we find former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and current Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, not natural revolutionaries.
They would like to carve up the megabanks and especially to separate retail banking from securities trading, or what is often now called “casino banking.” (In fact, the analogy is unfair to casino owners, who have a much stronger record in risk management than do most investment banks).
In the blue corner sit US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and his British counterpart, Alistair Darling, who argue that a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act, which divided investment banking from commercial banking, is not appropriate for today’s markets.
They believe that regulators can ring-fence capital supporting different business lines, to prevent contagion risk, and perhaps impose a surcharge on large “systemic” firms, to reflect the price of their implicit support from the central bank and government.
Depending on size, this might constrain the ambitions of institutions that have plainly been “too big to manage,” as well as “too big to fail,” which is the most fearsome combination.
Where do I stand in this lively debate?
I believe that more diversity in banking, and more competition, is highly desirable.
There is far too much concentration following the crisis, certainly in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe.
Neelie Kroes, the retiring EU Competition Commissioner, was surely right to demand some divestiture of branches from the biggest groups, though arguably she did not go far enough.
It is encouraging, too, that private equity funds look interested in creating and funding new entrants.
We need new capital, and new approaches to management, in the banking system.
But I am nervous about the idea that regulators are best placed to determine the future shape of markets.
If the authorities are seen to have brought new institutions into being by fiat, might they not be obligated to support them, come what may?
Over time, the aim must surely be to minimize the proportion of the financial sector that is subject to some form of state guarantee.
A regulator-designed banking system would make that aim more difficult to achieve.

A Coordinated Response to COVID-19
NEW YORK – Within just a few months, the COVID-19 coronavirus has enveloped the world, infecting 435,000 people, killing more than 19,000, and overwhelming even advanced economies’ health systems.
Once the shock hits vulnerable low-income countries, the already-high human and economic costs will rise further – for the entire world.
The only chance we have of limiting the fallout is to work together.
When the news first broke that a novel coronavirus had emerged in China, many assumed that the outbreak’s trajectory would resemble that of the last China-born coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome.
But the 2002-03 SARS outbreak lasted only six months, and affected just 26 countries.
As such, that outbreak’s economic consequences – borne primarily by the services sector – were short-lived and concentrated largely in China, though neighboring economies were affected through trade and finance.
When the outbreak ended, the Chinese economy recovered rapidly, with fiscal and monetary expansion supporting a rebound in consumption and investment.
By contrast, COVID-19 has already spread to more than 170 countries, disrupting value chains, impeding worker mobility, increasing production costs, and weakening demand.
In China, fixed investment, industrial output, and retail sales declined at a double-digit annual rate in the first two months of the year.
The United States and many European economies are also suffering.
The US stock market just faced its worst week since 2008; indeed, market turmoil worldwide evokes the global financial crisis of 12 years ago.
The OECD now forecasts a 1.5-percentage-point decline in global GDP growth this year, though the specifics depend on how long the outbreak lasts.
If the virus can be contained within the next month, the economy could bounce back by the end of 2020.
If not, the economic consequences could be catastrophic.
In the worst-case scenario, the world would face a contraction similar to that of 2009.
But this does not mean that governments are powerless to limit the pandemic’s fallout.
The problem is that, so far, they have implemented inward-looking measures, many of which have turned out to be ineffective or excessive.
Unilateral travel bans have caused chaos.
Monetary easing – including the US Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would slash policy rates nearly to zero and resume quantitative easing – has done little to reassure investors.
Governments are also implementing various fiscal measures, including tax breaks and subsidies.
Larger-scale fiscal action will come later, and its effects – in both the short and long term – are uncertain.
In truth, many economies have less scope for expansionary fiscal and monetary policy than they did after the global economic crisis.Policy interest rates in Europe and Japan are already negative.
And most advanced economies have little fiscal space.
In any case, unilateral measures would never be sufficient to protect a deeply interconnected global economy, let alone to combat a virus that doesn’t respect borders.
Instead, the leaders of all major economies should work together to design a comprehensive strategy that encompasses multilateral and coordinated national-level action.
In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, G20 leaders agreed to coordinate monetary and fiscal policies – including interest-rate cuts, quantitative easing, and spending measures worth 5.5% percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010 – and rejected trade protectionism.
Together with wide-ranging reforms aimed at safeguarding the global financial system, these measures played a crucial role in saving the world economy.
Today, governments – especially from the G20 economies – should adopt a similar approach.
Of course, given the lack of fiscal and monetary ammunition, the details will need to differ.
But a coordinated joint response – including fiscal, financial, and trade measures – remains vital.
Moreover, in a pandemic, economic policy is not enough; health-related actions are also needed.
Unilateral travel bans should be eschewed in favor of cooperative responses, including information-sharing and coordination in the development and delivery of vaccines and treatments.
Public-health systems must be protected.
Cooperation is in everyone’s interest.
Yet, at a time of intensifying nationalism, weak political leadership, and rising political and economic tensions between the world’s two largest economies, effective international action is proving difficult to come by.
The US and China, for example, are locked in an utterly counter-productive blame game.
US President Donald Trump has insisted on calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus,” stoking xenophobia and impeding progress.
Some Chinese officials have promoted the conspiracy theory that the US military brought the virus to China.
This approach may be used to justify economically damaging restrictions on cross-border flows of goods and people.
But the unavoidable reality is that no country can handle this pandemic alone.
As we have seen in every past global crisis, effective policy coordination is the only way to limit cross-border spillovers and protect trade and financial flows.
There is some reason for hope.
G7 leaders have pledged to use “appropriate” fiscal and monetary measures to respond to the pandemic and restore growth.
But the G20, working with international organizations, would be a better – and better-resourced – platform for planning a coordinated response.
The upcoming virtual G20 summit is the ideal opportunity to get started.
Leaders should share information and experiences from China, South Korea, and Europe; agree to collaborate on the development of diagnostics and therapeutics; and establish the pillars of economic-policy coordination.
Throughout this process, the G20 should bear in mind the need to prepare for the next crisis.
In this age of interdependence, the only way to help ourselves is to help one another.
Short of a vaccine, international cooperation is our best weapon against a deadly virus – and our best defense against global economic collapse.

The Battle for Santa Claus’s Home
STOCKHOLM – A couple of years ago, a Canadian minister proudly declared that Santa Claus was a citizen of Canada.
After all, his home and toy factory are at the North Pole, which, according to the minister’s interpretation, belongs to Canada.
Though Santa Claus has not commented on the matter, it is now clear that he could choose several passports when he travels the world on December 24th.
In 2007, a privately funded mini-submarine planted a Russian flag directly beneath his alleged home.
And two weeks ago, Denmark, which has sovereignty over Greenland, staked its own territorial claim, also covering the North Pole.
By filing its claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Denmark has joined our era’s “great game”: the contest for economic control over a large part of the Arctic.
And Denmark’s claim is massive.
Not only does it seek sovereignty over everything between Greenland and the North Pole; it is also extending its claim to nearly 900,000 square kilometers, all the way to the existing limits of the Russian economic zone on the other side of the Pole – an area 20 times Denmark’s size.
How to assess countries’ claims to Arctic territory hinges on the status of the Lomonosov Ridge, a vast formation that rises from the sea floor and stretches 1,800 kilometers from Greenland to the East Siberian continental shelf.
Everyone agrees that it is a ridge.
The key question is whether it is an extension of the Greenland shelf or an extension of the East Siberia shelf.
Denmark, together with the government of Greenland, now claims that it is the former, giving it the right to extend its economic zone across a huge area at the top of the world.
Though nothing is yet known about the claim that Russia says it will present in the spring, there is no doubt that it will argue the opposite.
And what about the Canadians and their claim?
That remains to be seen, but there have been reports that Prime Minister Stephen Harper is dissatisfied that Canadian scientists are not being sufficiently aggressive in pressing the country’s case.
Nonetheless, for all the hype about a “race for the Arctic,” and despite the rather icy atmosphere among the claimants, there is little reason to fear conflict.
Under the terms of the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration, all of the countries bordering the Arctic Ocean agree to resolve their claims peacefully and based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
According to settled procedure, a UN commission will first judge whether the claims have merit.
If they are overlapping, which is highly probable, bilateral negotiations will be held.
Such talks, to put it mildly, could take time.
Norway and Russia negotiated over a far smaller territorial delimitation for four decades.
Both Denmark and Russia have been devoting significant resources to exploring the Lomonosov Ridge.
Denmark has hired Swedish icebreakers for repeated expeditions, and Russia has been deploying special submarines to obtain samples from the ridge and the ocean floor.
The Arctic region has always been strategically vital for Russia, accounting for roughly 85% of Russia’s natural-gas production, which is based primarily in Western Siberia.
The Kremlin has activated a new military command for the Arctic, and is busy reopening air bases and radar stations along its Arctic shoreline.
But it is a very long way from these new Russian bases to virtually everywhere.
And, in addition to the vast distances, there is the harsh climate.
A Canadian military commander, asked what he would do if foreign soldiers attacked his country’s Far North, calmly replied that he would dispatch an expedition to rescue them.
Though Russia had hoped for a rapid increase in shipping along the Northern Sea Route, commercial traffic this year fell by 77%.
Of course, the stakes are too high for Canada, Denmark, and Russia to allow the region’s remoteness and its hostile environment to influence how resolutely they press their claims.
Boundaries like these are fixed once and forever, and no one knows what discoveries, technologies, and opportunities the future might bring.
But for the time being, neither Santa Claus, nor anyone else, has reason to be worried.
The nature of the Lomonosov Ridge will be debated for years to come, while his thoughts – and ours – are likely to be focused on more immediate issues.

E Pluribus Europe?
BRUSSELS – The European Union’s economic crises of the last half-decade have fueled the emergence of a deep divide between the northern creditor countries and the southern debtors.
Now Europe’s migrant crisis is creating an east-west divide between the countries that are welcoming toward the ongoing influx of refugees, and those who want to do little, or nothing, to help.
Add to that growing political divisions within member countries, and one must ask: Is the EU coming unglued?
The creditor/debtor split was thrown into sharp relief this summer, during the negotiations over Greece’s third bailout agreement.
Germany, the leading proponent of austerity and the most influential creditor, was accused of insufficient flexibility and solidarity; Greece, for its part, was lambasted for failing to implement the reforms that it promised the first two times it was bailed out.
(It was France, neither entirely “north” nor entirely “south,” that ended up playing a vital role in facilitating the deal.)
Germany is now trying to lead the way in the migrant crisis as well, but this time by its generosity.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has pledged to take in more than 800,000 refugees just this year. Welcoming crowds have lined streets and filled train stations in German cities, offering drinks, food, and clothing to the exhausted refugees, many of whom have walked hundreds of miles and risked their lives to get to safety.
Whereas Merkel declared forcefully that Islam was also a religion of Germany, some in Eastern Europe have declared that they will welcome only a small number of refugees – and only if they are Christian.
Such bigotry plays directly into the hands of Islamist extremists worldwide.
The refugee crisis is all the more challenging in view of EU member countries’ internal political fragmentation.
While those on the left support cautious acceptance of refugees, the further one moves to the right, the more negative the attitude becomes.
Even the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, has proved a reluctant partner in this area.
Yet another divide lies between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU.
Given the UK’s role, alongside France, as the key force in European defense and a significant authority in world affairs, particularly with regard to climate- and development-related issues, the prospect of a genuine split should be a source of serious concern for the EU.
These divisions have created deep doubts about the dream of ever-closer union in Europe, underpinned by a shared system of governance that allows for more effective decision-making. Likewise, they are not conducive to implementation of the reforms that are needed to spur economic growth.
Yet it is still too early to write off progress toward increased European integration.
In fact, when it comes to EU cohesion, more cleavages are probably better than a single divide.
When economic considerations alone were dominating the debate, austerity-obsessed northern Europe, oblivious to any Keynesian considerations, and struggling southern Europe, desperately in need of fiscal room to make demand-boosting, job-creating structural reforms politically feasible, were at loggerheads.
The situation became so heated that some respected observers even proposed creating a “northern euro” for the region around Germany, and a “southern euro” in the Mediterranean (where France would fit was unclear).
In such a eurozone, the European Central Bank would have to split, and the northern euro would appreciate.
Exchange-rate uncertainty would reappear, not only between the two euros, but also, before long, within the “northern” and “southern” zones, owing to the collapse of confidence in the very idea of a currency union.
Within the northern bloc, Germany would play an even more outsize role than it does now, a situation that would likely generate new tensions.
Similarly, a clear division between a refugee-friendly west and a closed east would effectively end the Schengen Agreement, because the political disagreement would harden into a physical barrier blocking the free movement of people within the EU.
Such a split would be as damaging to Europe’s cohesion as a divided eurozone.
But what if countries that are on opposite sides of one cleavage are on the same side of another?
Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden may agree on the immigration issue, while Greece, France, Italy, and Portugal agree on eurozone macroeconomic policies.
France, Poland, and the UK may be willing to spend more on defense, while Germany remains more pacifist.
And Germany, the Scandinavian countries, and the UK may be at the forefront of the fight against climate change.
Moreover, the Europe-wide political “families” of Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, and so on could be allies on some policies and opponents on others, transcending national or regional borders, and moving toward pan-European politics, with the European Parliament increasing its democratic debate and oversight functions.
A Europe where countries do not fit neatly into one category or another, and where flexible coalitions emerge on various issues, probably has a greater chance of progressing than one divided simply between north and south or east and west.
Of course, there remains the challenge of strengthening institutions so that they can manage this diversity and reconcile it with political effectiveness.
Here, greater scope for weighted and double-majority voting is crucial.
But, for truly democratic societies, the challenge of reconciling divergent interests never goes away.

Enlisting Women in Africa’s Health Fight
BRAZZAVILLE – Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) disproportionately affect women and girls.
Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) alone causes severe pain, bleeding, and lesions in more than 16 million women and girls in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Beyond causing widespread physical suffering, NTDs have a severe long-term socioeconomic impact on millions of women and girls.
Women who have been scarred or disfigured from diseases such as FGS and lymphatic filariasis are often stigmatized to the point that they are unable to marry or are abandoned by their spouses.
And even though disfigurement and social stigma are not lethal conditions, they can cause or exacerbate psychological disorders and limit the opportunities women and girls have.
Since 2000, enough pharmaceuticals for five billion preventive treatments against NTDs have been donated.
And many people now recognize that controlling, and eventually eliminating, NTDs will be essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which apply to such diverse areas as nutrition, education, health, water, sanitation and hygiene, and economic growth.
Because the SDGs are based on the principle of “leaving no one behind,” they cannot be considered a success until they have been met everywhere, and for all people – including women and girls.
SDG 5, in particular, calls for the world to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” by 2030.
Gender equity applies to both sexes, but special attention is needed to improve conditions for women and girls.
In Africa, women are often disenfranchised, even though they account for more than half of the continent’s population.
To ensure that they are not forgotten, we need to improve our understanding of how gendered power relationships operate, and address those social dynamics head on.
Because women and girls in their childbearing years suffer disproportionately from the health and social effects of NTDs, it is critically important that they be included in any large-scale health-policy interventions that are proposed.
And, beyond making women the focus of NTD programs, we should acknowledge that they will play a central role in advancing the sustainable development agenda.
We need to empower women and girls to promote and lead social-mobilization efforts in Africa.
Women are front-line partners for public-health advocates who are working to make essential medicines available across the continent.
Moreover, women can help to control NTD vectors at the source, by ensuring that all members of their community are complying with anti-NTD drug distribution and treatment programs.
Ongoing efforts to control and eliminate NTDs in Africa have made some progress.
But the time has come to develop more innovative policy tools.
We urgently need integrated, inter-programmatic, and inter-sectoral approaches that address NTDs’ social, economic, and etiological dynamics.
And we will need the full participation of the most vulnerable communities.
Without that, no program aimed at ultimately eradicating NTDs can succeed.
This year marks the fifth anniversary of the World Health Organization’s Roadmap to eliminate NTDs, and of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases.
It is encouraging to see that the international community is recognizing not only the disproportionate burden that NTDs place on women, but also the essential role that women play in controlling and eradicating these diseases.
Now that an ever-growing international partnership has emerged, we have a unique opportunity to put an end to these debilitating diseases once and for all.
In 2016, the WHO Regional Office for Africa launched the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN), which provides African countries with technical assistance and fundraising tools to fight the five NTDs that can be preempted with preventive chemotherapy: onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and trachoma.
ESPEN is an effort to bring together governments, the global public-health community, and other stakeholders.
Our goal is to strengthen partnerships that are designed specifically to eliminate NTDs.
Toward that end, ESPEN is actively supporting national-level anti-NTD programs that have been established to break the cycle of poverty that NTDs cause and sustain.
As the WHO works toward achieving the SDGs, we will continue to foster participatory approaches that include the most vulnerable populations – especially women and girls – in the fight against disease.
Ultimately, the only way to ensure long-term success is to empower those who are most affected.

The Lonely Arab Crowd
PARIS – In The Hubris of the Zero Point, the Colombian philosopher Santiago Castro-Gomez describes René Descartes’s 1637 declaration “I think, therefore I am” as the moment white Europeans installed themselves above God as the sole arbiters of knowledge and truth.
With this turning point, they began to think of themselves as observers whose scientific methods, morals, and ethics overrode those of other cultures.
Cultural “zero points” are important because they serve as a dividing line – a clear demarcation of “before” and “after” that holds fundamental implications for the development of private and public life.
So it is instructive to consider the implications of Castro-Gomez’s concept for the Arab world.
Indeed, it could be argued that much of the region’s troubles are attributable to the absence of an indigenous “zero point” onto which a modern culture could be sturdily pinned.
In The Lonely Crowd, the American sociologist David Riesman identified three broad cultural types: tradition-directed cultures that look to inherited rituals, morals, and values for guidance; inner-directed cultures, in which people behave according to self-nourished values; and other-directed cultures that react predominantly to external norms and peer influences.
Riesman’s framework has particular resonance in the Arab world today, where rising literacy rates and rapid advances in communication technology have stirred a maelstrom of competing cultural narratives, with his three types competing to define the region’s future.
Ironically, it is the combination of increased literacy and modern technology that is fanning the flames of conflict between the two types of “reformers” – religious revivalists and Western-oriented modernizers.
Taking advantage of their ability to mass-produce and instantly disseminate ancient religious texts and Western-originating literature, the two camps battle for the hearts and minds of otherwise traditional societies.
According to the Lebanese publisher Samar Abou-Zeid, however, religious books are among the most downloaded works of literature in the Arab world.
The trouble is that most religious texts consumed today in the Arab world address an audience of specialists that no longer exists and – as Riesman warned – they are often misconstrued.
The people and the times for which these texts were written are completely different from the people reading them today.
Devout Muslims, of course, have their own zero point: the year 610, when the Angel Gabriel revealed the Koran’s first verse to the Prophet Muhammad.
From then on, many Muslims have regarded themselves as the bearers of a righteous truth and moral vision that takes precedence over all others.
This has inevitably put religious revivalists in opposition to the second cultural type vying for preeminence in the Arab world: Western-educated, inner-directed modernists who hold Descartes’s declaration as their reference point.
These Arabs – often the economic elite – read, admire, and consume products of a culture that, despite its proclaimed commitment to “universal values,” continues to be stingily Eurocentric and dominated by Christian intellectual tradition.
As a result, they are increasingly likely to feel like exiles both at home and abroad.
The final, other-directed strand of Arab culture is arguably the most dominant: those whom Riesman would have called the “lonely Arab crowd.”
Free of roots or tradition, they take refuge in superficiality from the conflicts that surround them, seeking fulfillment in consumerism, careers, and lifestyles.
Their zero point is the latest fad or fashion.
This cultural turbulence is due – at least in part – to the absence of a contemporary homegrown intellectual tradition capable of providing Arab societies with an inner compass based on local values and modern perspectives.
This cultural vacuum is most evident in the mismatch between the region’s reading habits and the response of its publishing industry.
Egyptians, for example, read for an average of 7.5 hours per week, compared to five hours and 42 minutes in the United States.
And yet in 2012, according to Abou-Zeid, the entire Arab world and its 362 million inhabitants produced just over 15,000 titles, putting it in the same league as Romania (with a population of 21.3 million), Ukraine (45.6 million), or the American publisher Penguin Random House.
To maintain a similar proportion to population, the Arab world should be publishing 10-20 times more titles than it does today.
The dominance of old religious texts and Western-produced works has left modern Arab readers polarized, without a zero point of their own.
It is ironic that increased literacy and adoption of modern technology have contributed not to intellectual growth, but to regional strife.
It may be no coincidence that Lebanon, one of the first countries in the region to boost literacy rates, was also the first to tumble into civil war.
Unless Arab and Muslim societies rediscover, revitalize, and in some respects create their homegrown contemporary intellectual tradition, the result will be cultural drift or, far worse, the continuation of bloody civil strife.

Putin’s Kampf
BRUSSELS – Russia’s seizure of Crimea is the most naked example of peacetime aggression that Europe has witnessed since Nazi Germany invaded the Sudetenland in 1938.
It may be fashionable to belittle the “lessons of Munich,” when Neville Chamberlain and Édouard Daladier appeased Hitler, deferring to his claims on Czechoslovakia.
But if the West acquiesces to Crimea’s annexation – the second time Russian President Vladimir Putin has stolen territory from a sovereign state, following Russia’s seizure of Georgia’s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions in 2008 – today’s democratic leaders will surely regret their inaction.
In Western capitals, the response so far has been mixed.
The punishments being considered – expulsion from the G-8, for example – would be laughable were the threat to Europe’s peace not so grave.
Putin regards the breakup of the Soviet Union as the greatest catastrophe of modern times, and he has sought relentlessly to refashion Russia’s lost empire.
If the West intends to be taken seriously, it needs to act as decisively as Putin has.
Putin’s many successes in his imperial project have come virtually without cost.
His Eurasian Economic Community has corralled energy-rich states like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan into Russia’s camp.
Georgia was dismembered in 2008.
Armenia’s government was bullied into spurning the European Union’s offer of an Association Agreement.
Now the greatest geostrategic prize of all – Ukraine – may fall into Putin’s hands.
Russia without Ukraine, former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote, “ceases to be an empire, but Russia with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.” And, because the vast majority of Ukrainians have no desire to join Putin’s empire, we can be certain that the state Putin will lead from this point on will be a highly militarized one, rather like the Soviet Union but without the ruling Communist Party.
Given the scale of Putin’s adventurism, the world’s response must be commensurate.
Canceled summits, trade deals, or membership in diplomatic talking shops like the G-8 are not enough.
Only actions that impose tangible economic sanctions that affect Russian citizens – who, after all, have voted Putin into power time and again – offer any hope of steering the Kremlin away from its expansionist course.
Which sanctions might work?
First, Turkey should close the Dardanelles to Russian shipping, as it did after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.
Back then, Turkey closed access to the Black Sea to prevent the US from intervening, though the US, it is now clear, had no intention of doing so.
Today, it should close the Turkish straits not only to Russian warships, but to all commercial vessels bound for Russia’s Black Sea ports.
The impact on Russia’s economy – and on Putin’s military pretensions – would be considerable.
Turkey is permitted to close the Dardanelles under a 1982 amendment to the 1936 Montreux Convention.
Indeed, Turkey could turn Putin’s justification for seizing Crimea – that he is protecting ethnic Russians there – against him, by arguing that it is protecting its Turkic Tatar kin, who, given Russia’s ill treatment of them in the past, are anxious to remain under Ukrainian rule.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu turned his plane around in mid-air this week to fly to Kyiv to offer support to the new interim government.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, no pushover himself, as Putin well knows, should follow up on that gesture of support by immediately closing the straits to Russian shipping – until Putin recalls all troops in Crimea to their Sevastopol bases or to Russia proper.
And Turkey should be offered an Article 5 guarantee from NATO should Russia seek to intimidate it.
Second, US President Barack Obama should impose the type of financial sanctions on Russia that he has imposed on Iran for its nuclear program.
Those sanctions have crippled Iran’s economy.
Similarly, denying any bank that does business with a Russian bank or company access to the US financial system would create the kind of economic chaos last seen in Russia immediately after the fall of Communism.
Ordinary Russians should be made to understand that permitting Putin – whose primary claim to leadership is that he ended the penury of the first post-Soviet years – to continue with his imperialist aggression will cost them dearly.
Third, Obama should emphasize to the Chinese their stake in Eurasian stability.
Putin may regard the Soviet Union’s disintegration as a tragedy, but for China it was the greatest geostrategic gift imaginable.
At a stroke, the empire that stole millions of hectares of Chinese territory over the centuries, and that threatened the People’s Republic with nuclear annihilation, simply vanished.
Since then, Central Asia’s independent states, and even Ukraine, have become important trading partners for China.
Russia’s conquests in Georgia greatly displeased China, as was seen at the post-war summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (a regional grouping that includes ex-Soviet countries that share borders with China and Russia).
Russia pushed the SCO to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
But the SCO balked.
The group’s Central Asian members – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan – would not have stood up to the Kremlin without China’s support.
Today, however, Chinese President Xi Jinping may need to be less cryptic in his response to Putin’s adventurism.
Indeed, the real test of China’s claim that it is a responsible stakeholder in the world community will come soon at the United Nations.
Will it back Putin’s clear flouting of international law, or will it back Ukraine’s territorial integrity?
There are other possible punitive measures.
Visas can be denied and canceled for all Russian officials.
Assets can be frozen, particularly those laundered by oligarchs close to Putin.
Only when the pain becomes intolerable, particularly for the elite, will Putin’s kampf be defeated.
The cost of inaction is high.
Countless countries, from Japan to Israel, rely on America’s commitment to act robustly against grave breaches of the peace.
Moreover, when Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in 1994, it did so with the express understanding that the US (and the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) would guarantee its territorial integrity.
Should Crimea be annexed, no one should gainsay Ukraine if it rapidly re-nuclearized its defense (which it retains the technological capacity to do).
When Chamberlain returned from Munich, Winston Churchill said, “You were given the choice between war and dishonor.
You chose dishonor and you will have war.” Obama and other Western leaders face a similar choice.
And if they choose dishonor, one can be certain that an undeterred Putin will eventually give them more war.

Silicon Valley or Demand Mountain?
BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON – Everyone wants to know how to build the next Silicon Valley: an innovation hub that draws talent and capital, and that creates jobs, companies, and whole new industries.
Developed-country governments scramble to subsidize technology that could be the Next Big Thing.
Emerging-market policymakers hope that incentives like tax breaks and free land will induce innovators to settle and prosper there.
But most of these well-meaning schemes are missing an essential ingredient: demand.
Demand for innovation in specific areas of technology has been the common force behind all high-tech hot spots, as well as the most important inventions.
Technological breakthroughs such as antibiotics and cars responded to a compelling need felt by a huge number of consumers.
Government projects such as the United States’ Apollo program – intended to put a man on the moon – drove demand for more basic technologies (which are simply inventions that no one has asked for yet).
Silicon Valley itself was built on demand.
The US Department of Defense put up tens of billions of dollars in contracts for microelectronics, a commitment that both paid down innovators’ risk and created an infrastructure that would support the growth of start-ups.
All demand is not created equal, though, and it is instructive to examine the differences.
Consumer or market-driven demand – the kind most of us think of when we hear the word – is far less predictable, and therefore much riskier, than state-sponsored demand of the sort that landed a man on the moon.
Companies that depend solely on their products’ commercial appeal are limited in the kinds of innovations that they can safely introduce, because if one of their products fails in the marketplace, they may not survive to build another one.
This is especially true of start-ups and small companies – the very players that everyone hopes will show up in the next-wave of Silicon Valleys.
Fortunately, by sponsoring long-term, targeted initiatives, governments can stimulate more predictable demand.
The Apollo program gave innovators clearly defined goals and a roadmap for getting there: first put animals in orbit, then put people there, then send probes to the moon, then send people there.
Equally important, the government offered rewards for interim progress, not just ultimate success.
Putting a monkey in space may not have been the most exciting achievement, but the government was paying for it, so it happened.
A smart government creates guaranteed demand not only for the solution itself, but for the steps along the way.
Coupling intermediate technical milestones with guaranteed incentives enables companies to focus on problems that might take ten years or more to solve.
It also motivates innovators from a variety of industries to take on complex problems that must be addressed by more than one kind of invention.
The US Defense Department’s microelectronics initiative required not only new materials and circuits, but also new methods of fabrication.
Because of the reward structure, these efforts could be coordinated, rather than pursued in isolation.
Unlike market-driven demand, which too often results in a winner-takes-all dynamic, state-sponsored demand creates an environment in which multiple solutions to technical problems can proliferate and coexist.
The pioneers of microelectronics tried many strategies to supplant vacuum tubes, and they delivered a host of semiconductors and chip designs: germanium, silicon, aluminum, gallium arsenide, PNP, NPN, CMOS, and so on. Some of these research efforts were never implemented, but many found their way into specialized devices.
The diversity of options allowed widespread adoption, paving the way for the digital revolution.
As with the microelectronics program, government incentives don’t have to line the road all the way to commercial success.
At some point, companies will be ready to sell products, and market demand can take over.
The US Department of Defense was the only customer for integrated circuits in 1962, but by the end of the decade consumers were buying transistor radios and pocket calculators in droves.
Likewise, state-sponsored demand should not take the form of subsidies to specific technologies or companies; the government has no business gambling taxpayer money on particular ventures.
Assuming that risk is the job of venture capitalists and others in finance, not public officials.
But there is little risk in offering a contract for a job well done: there is no payout if the problem remains unsolved.
And those payouts are modest compared to the research and development efforts they stimulate.
A program offering rewards of $1-5 billion in contracts or deployment commitments can generate many times that value in private-sector R&D. Innovators and their investors are willing to bet big on these opportunities, because they know that the eventual reward in revenue from a global customer base will far exceed the initial investment.
That makes state-sponsored demand a very efficient mechanism for generating innovation.
Because of the multiplier effect, small governments and states, and even large cities, can successfully sponsor the kind of demand that fosters a world-class innovation epicenter.
Certain Scandinavian countries, Chinese provinces, and the city-state of Singapore, for example, are ideally positioned to try this approach.
Some years ago, I calculated how many units of product need to be sold to launch a technology.
The number is actually quite modest: If you can move between 100,000 and one million units of a disruptive product, you can establish the technology standards for that category and in time become the global leader of a new industry.
Government sponsorship ensures that a certain number of people will adopt your product.
At the start, it need not be that many.
The economic planners and policymakers who are chasing Silicon Valley’s taillights are learning that they cannot always replicate the entrepreneurial culture and finance mechanisms that flourish there now.
But they have forgotten how it all started: guaranteed demand, which stimulates the most ambitious kind of innovation.
The lesson is a simple one: Don’t try to build another Silicon Valley.
Instead, build a Demand Mountain, and the innovators will come.

Germany’s Same Old Foreign Policy
MUNICH – More than ten weeks after its general election, Germany continues to be without a new government.
But, though the post-election coalition negotiations have been unusually prolonged, there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy.
Indeed, when Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) finally presented their coalition agreement on November 27, the working group on foreign and security policy had been finished with its job for two weeks.
Except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with Germany’s European and international partners (such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes), continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of German foreign and security policy.
Observers may disagree about whether German leaders’ stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition.
Those who hope for more active German leadership may well be disappointed by the new government.
Big ideas, or even big questions, are notably absent from the coalition agreement.
This is very much a reflection of many Germans’ views about themselves and their future: they are comfortable with the status quo, see no need for further reform proposals, are not interested in grand strategy, and would largely prefer to be left alone.
Consider NATO policy.
Successive German governments have maintained that the alliance should be, or even is, the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges.
But Germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to NATO headquarters.
And when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls “our geographic neighborhood,” the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job.
Or consider the question of Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive German role.
Instead, the compromise solution will be no solution: neither yes nor no.
At the same time, some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement.
For starters, the United States’ strategic “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region is described as an opportunity for Europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region.
Moreover, to encourage this outcome, the coalition agreement promises that the government will “adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the Common Foreign and Security Policy” after the EU summit in December 2013.
It includes a call for an annual European Council session on security and defense, as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of EU foreign relations.
In addition, the German government will support European defense integration and maintain the establishment of a European army as a long-term goal.
This may not amount to much in practice, but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere.
Finally, the coalition agreement responds to concerns about Germany’s ability to be a reliable partner in NATO and EU military missions in a potentially more integrated EU defense organization.
According to a 1994 ruling by Germany’s Constitutional Court, the German parliament has the final say when it comes to deploying soldiers.
However, Germany’s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the German parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment.
The coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue.
Nonetheless, they have agreed that, within a year, a commission will provide different options and models to protect the German parliament’s rights while providing assurances to Germany’s European partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments.
Should the SPD, which will vote on the coalition agreement in early December, block the formation of the new government (an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question), disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit.
Aside from a few minor particulars, consensus prevails.
For some, that is a cause for ambivalence.
“I do not like the idea that Germany plays itself up to impose its will on others,” German President Joachim Gauck said recently.
“Yet neither do I like the idea that Germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity.”
Whether German foreign policy can and should do more is a reasonable question.
To some degree, the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership.
But it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully.
The bottom line is this: Expect no surprises from Germany.
Considering how difficult it has been for some, if not most, other EU countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years, that is actually rather good news.

The Future of Fish Farming
NEW HAVEN – Demand for seafood is skyrocketing, and will continue to rise throughout this century.
The only way to meet it will be through aquaculture.
Yet, while next-generation aquaculture will be far more ecologically responsible than its predecessors, it will also use far more energy.
If that additional energy is not clean and cheap, new aquaculture technologies cannot serve our broader environmental and climate goals.
The rise in demand for seafood is a good thing, to a point.
Fish are more efficient than pork and beef, because they require fewer inputs to yield the same amount of protein.
So, as global meat consumption continues torise, it makes sense for a sizeable share of it to come from the sea.
On the other hand, rising demand for seafood poses significant ecological risks.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, nearly one-third of global fish stocks are already harvested at an unsustainable level, meaning wild populations cannot regenerate quickly enough to make up for the rate at which they’re fished.
And, because wild populations lack the carrying capacity to meet the increase in demand, more fish have to be farmed.
For that reason, aquaculture is already the leading mode of fish production for human consumption.
But, like fishing, it also poses ecological risks.
Because aquaculture systems often operate on coastlines or near inland rivers or ponds, they tend to disrupt natural habitats, contribute to nitrogen pollution, and add undue pressure on feeder fish stocks.
For example, fish farming is one of the main drivers of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia.
But even with these conservation challenges in mind, aquaculture remains the only option for meeting future demand.
The path that the industry takes today will thus have far-reaching environmental implications for years to come.
In the near term, fish farms can in fact be made cleaner.
A few responsible producers have introduced new techniques and technologies to combat pollution, from monitoring feed uptake with video cameras to integrating filter feeders like shellfish and seaweed into their systems.
Others are attempting to reduce their reliance on forage fish by replacing fish meal with plant proteins, or by adopting new biotechnologies to produce fish feed more sustainably.
But so long as these aquaculture systems are embedded in coastal or freshwater environments, they will continue to contribute to habitat loss and ecological disruption.
For the long term, then, experts generally offer two ways forward: land-based recirculating systems and offshore aquaculture.
Both could potentially mitigate the negative externalities of aquaculture and make fish production sustainable well into the future.
In the first approach, fish farms would be moved from the ocean to recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), in which fish are housed in indoor tanks that are regulated by pumps, heaters, aerators, and filters.
One of the biggest advantages of this approach is its adaptability: an RAS can be located almost anywhere, from urban lots to retired hog barns.
Better yet, these systems are designed to recycle nearly all of the water they use, which eliminates the problem of coastal pollution. Accordingly, the advocacy organization Seafood Watch currently gives all RAS-farmed fish a “Best Choice” tag.
The other option is to move aquaculture in the opposite direction: out to sea.
Offshore systems harness the forces of the ocean, by using deeper waters and stronger currents to funnel excess nutrients and waste away from sensitive coastal ecosystems.
As a result, they have no need for mechanical pumps or filters (although motorized pens may eventually take to the seas).
In the United States, the aquaculture industry has started to move toward RAS production.
For example, a Norwegian firm has just announced plans to build a huge new land-based salmon farm in Maine.
And examples of offshore projects can be found off the coasts of Norway, California, and Hawaii.
But both systems are still a niche, rather than the norm.
One of the primary problems with cleaner approaches to aquaculture is that they are energy-intensive.
With land-based systems, natural processes such as filtration and water exchange and dispersal must be carried out mechanically, which requires a lot of electricity.
That isn’t necessarily a problem in places with low-carbon electricity grids, like France, but it would be in a place like Nova Scotia, which relies heavily on coal.
Likewise, offshore operations require diesel fuel for transport and maintenance, and that will remain the case until electric boats or low-carbon liquid fuels become more viable.
Although open-ocean aquaculture should still require less diesel fuel than commercial fishing – and could run on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or waves – offshore aquaculture is more energy-intensive than conventional fish farms.
And even if newer aquaculture systems can overcome their current operational and regulatory challenges, their biggest hurdle will be the unavailability of cheap, low-carbon energy.
As long as fossil fuels account for most global energy use, the environmental promise of next-generation aquaculture will go unrealized.
This is true for a wide range of industries.
Without cleaner and cheaper energy across the board, we will not be able to meet our broader environmental and climate goals.
Our current energy technologies – nuclear and renewables included – still have a way to go to meet energy demand.
In the meantime, the aquaculture industry will need to make further investments and develop new innovations to put itself on a path to sustainability – be it on land or in the sea.

Fiscal Follies
NEW YORK – The fiscal stimulus that most advanced economies and emerging markets implemented during the 2008-2009 global recession – together with monetary easing and the backstopping of the financial system – prevented the Great Recession from turning into another Great Depression in 2010.
At a time when every component of private demand was collapsing, the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes stopped the global economy’s free-fall and created the basis for recovery.
Unfortunately, stimulus spending and the related bailout of the financial system, together with the recession’s effect on revenues, contributed to fiscal deficits on the order of 10% of GDP in most advanced economies.
According to the International Monetary Fund and others, these economies’ ratio of public debt to GDP will surpass 110% by 2015, compared to 70% before the crisis.
Aging populations in most advanced economies imply additional public debt in the long term, owing to non-fully-funded pension schemes and rising health-care costs.
Thus, in most advanced economies, deficits need to be reduced to avoid a fiscal train wreck down the line.
But much research, including a recent study by the IMF, suggests that raising taxes and reducing government spending has a negative short-term effect on aggregate demand, thereby reinforcing deflationary and recessionary trends – and undermining fiscal consolidation.
In an ideal world, where policymakers could credibly commit to medium- to long-term fiscal adjustment, the optimal and desirable path would be to commit today to a schedule of spending reductions and tax increases, phased in gradually over the next decade as the economy recovers.
That way, if the economy needed another targeted fiscal stimulus in the short run, financial markets would not respond by driving up borrowing costs.
Unfortunately, the fiscal policy currently adopted by various advanced economies deviates sharply from this path of credible medium-term consolidation combined with short-term additional stimulus.
In the US, we have the worst of all possible worlds.
On one hand, stimulus had become a dirty word – even within the Obama administration – well before the Republicans’ mid-term election victory ruled out another round altogether.
On the other hand, medium-term consolidation will be all but impossible in America’s current atmosphere of hyper-partisanship, with Republicans blocking any tax increase and Democrats resisting reforms of entitlement spending.
Nor is there any pressure from bond markets to concentrate the minds of policymakers.
In the periphery of the eurozone, the problem is the opposite: bond vigilantes are demanding that Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy front-load fiscal consolidation or watch their borrowing costs go through the roof, risking them their market access and triggering a public-debt crisis.
Markets don’t care that front-loaded fiscal consolidation is exacerbating recession and thus making the goal of reducing debt and deficits as a share of GDP near-impossible to achieve.
To avoid a persistent and destructive recession, the fiscal and structural reforms imposed by the bond vigilantes should be accompanied by other euro-zone policies that restore growth and prevent vicious debt dynamics.
The European Central Bank should ease monetary policy in order to weaken the value of the euro and bootstrap the periphery’s growth.
And Germany should cut taxes temporarily – rather than raising taxes, as planned – in order to increase disposable income and stimulate German demand for the periphery’s goods and services.
Alas, neither of the two biggest players in the euro zone is pursuing policies consistent with restoring sustained growth in the euro zone’s periphery.
The ECB’s monetary policy is too tight; and Germany is front-loading fiscal austerity.
Thus, the periphery is destined to a destructive deflationary and recessionary adjustment that will exacerbate the risks of recession, insolvency, eventual defaults and, possibly, exit from the euro.
In the United Kingdom, the new government gave several reasons for front-loading fiscal consolidation.
The bond vigilantes might have woken up if early austerity was not implemented; the deficit was very large and the public sector bloated; and it is always politically easier to implement tough measures early in an administration, when popular support is still high and the next election is far off.
Certainly, the UK was playing with fiscal fire and needed some commitment to earlier austerity.
But phasing in austerity more gradually, and thus back-loading the adjustment, would have posed less risk to the economy’s anemic recovery while maintaining a credible commitment to fiscal consolidation.
Instead, the government could well end up with no plan B in case plan A – massively front-loaded austerity – leads to a double-dip recession.
In short, an optimal path of fiscal austerity would, in most countries, imply a back-loaded but credible commitment to medium-term consolidation, together with short-term additional stimulus when necessary and allowed by market conditions, thereby avoiding the prospect of a deflationary and recessionary spiral.
Unfortunately, the main advanced economies are following a divergent path – which, in some cases, will lead them in the opposite direction in 2011.
As a result, the risks of debt deflation and eventual disorderly sovereign and private-sector defaults are rising.

The Long Mystery of Low Interest Rates
CAMBRIDGE – As policymakers and investors continue to fret over the risks posed by today’s ultra-low global interest rates, academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes. By now, everyone accepts some version of US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s statement in 2005 that a “global savings glut” is at the root of the problem.
But economists disagree on why we have the glut, how long it will last, and, most fundamentally, on whether it is a good thing.
Bernanke’s original speech emphasized several factors – some that decreased the demand for global savings, and some that increased supply.
Either way, interest rates would have to fall in order for world bond markets to clear.
He pointed to how the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990’s caused the region’s voracious investment demand to collapse, while simultaneously inducing Asian governments to stockpile liquid assets as a hedge against another crisis.
Bernanke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in Germany and Japan, as well as to saving by oil-exporting countries, with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term.
Monetary policy, incidentally, did not feature prominently in Bernanke’s diagnosis.
Like most economists, he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artificially low levels for too long, eventually demand will soar and inflation will jump.
So, if inflation is low and stable, central banks cannot be blamed for low long-term rates.
In fact, I strongly suspect that if one polled investors, monetary policy would be at the top of the list, not absent from it, as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates.
The fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absolving monetary policy of all responsibility.
Nevertheless, I share Bernanke’s instinct that, while central banks do set very short-term interest rates, they have virtually no influence over long-term real (inflation-adjusted) rates, other than a modest effect through portfolio management policies (for example, “quantitative easing”).
A lot has changed since 2005.
We had the financial crisis, and some of the factors cited by Bernanke have substantially reversed.
For example, Asian investment is booming again, led by China.
And yet global interest rates are even lower now than they were then.
Why?
There are several competing theories, most of them quite elegant, but none of them entirely satisfactory.
One view holds that long-term growth risks have been on the rise, raising the premium on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe, and raising precautionary saving in general.
(Of course, no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe, particularly from inflation and financial repression.)
Certainly, the 2008 financial crisis should have been a wakeup call to proponents of the “Great Moderation” view that long-term volatility has fallen.
Many studies suggest that it is becoming more difficult than ever to anchor expectations about long-term growth trends.
Witness, for example, the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating.
Shifting geopolitical power also breeds uncertainty.
Another class of academic theories follows Bernanke (and, even earlier, Michael Dooley, David Folkerts-Landau, and Peter Garber) in attributing low long-term interest rates to the growing importance of emerging economies, but with the major emphasis on private savings rather than public savings.
Because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets, their citizens seek safe haven in advanced-country government bonds.
A related theory is that emerging economies’ citizens find it difficult to diversify the huge risk inherent in their fast-growing but volatile environments, and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets.
So they save massively.
These explanations have some merit, but one should recognize that central banks and sovereign wealth funds, not private citizens, are the players most directly responsible for the big savings surpluses.
It is a strain to think that governments have the same motivations as private citizens.
Besides, on closer inspection, the emerging-market explanation, though convenient, is not quite as compelling as it might seem.
Emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries, which neoclassical growth models suggest should push global interest rates up, not down.
Similarly, the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor.
According to standard trade theory, a global labor glut ought to imply an increased rate of return on capital, which again pushes interest rates up, not down.
Surely, any explanation must include the global constriction of credit, especially for small and medium-size businesses.
Tighter regulation of lending standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand, putting downward pressure on interest rates.
My best guess is that when global uncertainty fades and global growth picks up, global interest rates will start to rise, too.
But predicting the timing of this transition is difficult.
The puzzle of the global savings glut may live on for several years to come.

Beyond Carbon Metrics
BERLIN – Over the last ten years, “climate change” has become almost synonymous with “carbon emissions.”
The reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, measured in tons of “carbon equivalents” (CO2e) has emerged as the paramount objective in the quest to preserve the planet.
But such a simplistic approach cannot possibly resolve the highly complex and interconnected ecological crises that we currently face.
Global environmental policy’s single-minded focus on “carbon metrics” reflects a broader obsession with measurement and accounting.
The world runs on abstractions – calories, miles, pounds, and now tons of CO2e – that are seemingly objective and reliable, especially when embedded in “expert” (often economic) language.
As a result, we tend to overlook the effects of each abstraction’s history, and the dynamics of power and politics that continue to shape it.
One key example of a powerful and somewhat illusory global abstraction is the gross domestic product (GDP), which was adopted as the main measure of a country’s economic development and performance after World War II, when world powers were building international financial institutions that were supposed to reflect relative economic power.
Today, however, GDP has become a source of widespread frustration, as it fails to reflect the realities of people’s lives.
Like a car’s high beams, abstractions can be very illuminating; but they can also render invisible what lies outside their light.
Nonetheless, GDP remains by far the dominant measure of economic prosperity, reflecting the obsession with universality that accompanied the spread of capitalism worldwide.
Complex, nuanced, and qualitative imaginings that reflect local specificities are simply not as appealing as linear, overarching, and quantitative explanations.
When it comes to climate change, this preference translates into single-minded support for solutions that marginally reduce “net” carbon emissions – solutions that may impede broad economic transformations or undermine communities’ capacity to define specific problems and develop appropriate solutions.
This approach can be traced back to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where climate policy embarked on a rocky and violent path of forgotten alternatives. In the course of the last quarter century, at least three critical mistakes were made.
First, governments introduced the CO2e unit of calculation to quantify in a consistent manner the effects of disparate greenhouse gases, such as CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide.
The variations among these gases – in terms of their warming potential, how long they remain in the atmosphere, where they appear, and how they interact with local ecosystems and economies – are profound.
A single unit of measure simplifies matters considerably, allowing policymakers to pursue one blanket solution aimed at meeting a specific overarching target.
Second, the UN climate change convention emphasized “end of pipe” techniques (methods aimed at removing contaminants from the atmosphere).
This enabled decision-makers to deflect attention away from the more politically challenging objective of limiting the activities producing those emissions in the first place.
Third, policymakers decided to focus on “net” emissions, considering biological processes involving land, plants, and animals together with those associated with the burning of fossil fuels.
Just like industrial facilities, paddy fields and cows were treated as emissions sources, and tropical forests, monoculture tree plantations and bogs as emission sinks.
Policymakers began to seek solutions that involved offsetting emissions abroad, rather than cutting them at home (or at the source).
By 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was introduced, “more flexibility” was the order of the day, and trading in emissions certificates (or permits to pollute) was the preferred policy option.
Nearly two decades later, the effort to offset emissions is not only entrenched in climate politics; it has also made its way into the broader environmental-policy debate.
New markets for so-called “ecosystem services” are emerging all over the world.
For example, “wetland mitigation banking” in the United States is one of the older such markets.
It entails the preservation, enhancement, or creation of, say, a wetland or stream that offsets the adverse impacts of a planned project on a similar ecosystem elsewhere.
This is done by issuing certificates that can be traded.
“Biodiversity offsetting” schemes work in much the same way: A company or individual can purchase “biodiversity credits” to offset their “ecological footprint.”
If these schemes sound a little too convenient, that is because they are.
In fact, they are based on the same faulty concept as emissions trading, and in some cases, they actually translate biodiversity and ecosystems into CO2e.
Instead of changing our economic system to make it fit within the planet’s natural limits, we are redefining nature so that it fits within our economic system – and, in the process, precluding other forms of knowledge and real alternatives.
Now, in the wake of last December’s climate summit in Paris, the world is on the verge of taking yet another wrong turn, by embracing the idea of “negative emissions,” which assumes that new technologies will be able to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.
Yet such technologies have yet to be invented, and even if they were, their implementation would be highly risky.
Rather than pursue proven solutions – leaving fossil fuels in the ground, moving away from industrial agriculture toward agro-ecology, creating no-waste economies, and restoring natural ecosystems – we are counting on some miraculous innovation to save us, deus ex machina, just in the nick of time.
The folly of this approach should be obvious.
If carbon metrics continue to shape climate policy, new generations will know only a carbon-constrained – and, if they are lucky, a low-carbon – world.
Instead of pursuing such a simplistic vision, we must pursue richer strategies aimed at transforming our economic systems to work within – and with – our natural environment.
For that, we will need a new way of thinking that spurs active engagement to reclaim and conserve the spaces where alternative approaches can grow and flourish.
It will not be easy, but it will be worth it.

New-Model Central Banks
BERKELEY – We are used to thinking about the remit of central banks as focusing narrowly on price stability, or at most as targeting inflation while ensuring the smooth operation of the payment system.
But with the global financial crisis of 2008 and now COVID-19, we have seen central banks intervening to support a growing range of markets and activities, using instruments that extend well beyond interest rates and open market operations.
An example is the US Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, under which the Fed provides liquidity to lenders who extend loans to small businesses in pandemic-related distress.
This, clearly, is not your mother’s central bank.
Now we hear calls to broaden this ambit still further.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Fed board member Lael Brainard have each urged central banks to tackle climate change.
Against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement, US Representative Maxine Waters of California has pushed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to do more about inequality, including specifically racial inequality.
Such calls horrify central-banking purists, who warn that charging central banks with these additional responsibilities risks diverting them and their policy instruments from their primary objective of inflation control.
They caution that monetary policy is a blunt instrument for tackling climate change and inequality, which can be more effectively addressed by taxing carbon emissions or strengthening equal housing laws.
Above all, the critics worry that pursuing these other objectives will jeopardize central banks’ independence.
Central banks enjoy operational independence in order to pursue a specific mandate, because there is a consensus that the mandated objectives are best taken out of elected officials’ hands.
But independence does not mean central bankers are unaccountable to politicians and public opinion.
They must justify their actions and explain how their policy decisions advance the mandated objectives.
Their success or failure can be judged by whether or not the central bank achieves its independently verifiable targets.
With a greatly expanded mandate, the relationship between policy instruments and targets would become more complex.
Justifications for policy decisions would be harder to communicate. Success or failure would be more difficult to judge.
Indeed, insofar as monetary policy has only limited influence over climate change or inequality, targeting such variables would be setting up the central bank to fail. And frustration over failure might lead politicians to rethink the central bank’s operational independence.
These arguments are not without merit.
At the same time, central bankers cannot snooze quietly in their bunks in the face of an all-hands-on-deck emergency.
Calls for central banks to address climate change and inequality reflect an awareness that these problems have risen to the level of existential crises.
If central bankers ignored them, or said, “These urgent problems are best addressed by someone else,” their response would be seen as a haughty and perilous display of indifference.
At that point, their independence would truly be at risk.
So, what to do?
Central banks as regulators have tools with which to address climate change, and their responsibility for ensuring the integrity and stability of the financial system gives policymakers the mandate to use them. They can require more extensive climate-related financial disclosures.
They can impose stricter capital and liquidity requirements on financial institutions whose asset portfolios expose them to climate risk. Such tools will discourage the financial system from underwriting brown investments.
The challenge of understanding the risks to financial stability from climate change is that climate events are irregular and nonlinear.
When modeling them, it will be important for central banks to avoid the mistakes they made in modeling COVID-19.
Those problems arose because economists and epidemiologists worked in their separate silos.
So, one might ask advocates like Lagarde and Brainard: How many climate scientists have central banks hired?
When will they start?
When it comes to inequality, some central banks already have the relevant mandate.
In the United States, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 tasks regulators, including the Fed, with ensuring that low- and moderate-income families have adequate access to credit.
The Fed has delegated this responsibility to its 12 regional reserve banks, each of which fulfills it in different ways.
Stronger guidance from the Federal Reserve Board on exactly how to ensure equal access to credit, with explicit attention to racial disparities, would reinforce existing efforts.
It would be a departure for other central banks, such as the ECB, to address the credit access of minority and underprivileged groups.
But the European Parliament can so instruct it.
And the ECB Board can work with the national institutions that make up the European System of Central Banks in meeting that call.
Monetary policy has implications for issues beyond inflation and payments, including climate change and inequality.
It would be disingenuous, even dangerous, for central bankers to deny those connections, or to insist that they are someone else’s problem.
The best way forward for central bankers is to use monetary policy to target inflation, while directing their regulatory powers at other pressing concerns.

All the Queen’s Children
NEW YORK – Does monarchy – constitutional monarchy, that is, not the despotic kind – have any redeeming features left?
The arguments against maintaining kings and queens are mostly quite rational.
It is unreasonable in this democratic age to pay special deference to people solely on the basis of their birth.
Are we really supposed to admire and love modern monarchies, such as the British House of Windsor, even more so today, just because some new princess has been plucked from the middle class?
Monarchy has an infantilizing effect.
Witness how otherwise sensible adults are reduced to nervously grinning sycophants when they are granted the privilege of touching an extended royal hand.
At great monarchical displays, such as the royal wedding in London, millions become enthralled by child-like dreams of a “fairy-tale” marriage. The mystique of immense wealth, noble birth, and great exclusivity is further sustained by the global mass media that promote these rituals.
Now, one might argue that the dignified pomp of Queen Elizabeth II is preferable to the tawdry grandiosity of Silvio Berlusconi, Madonna, or Cristiano Ronaldo.
In fact, the British monarchy, especially, has been reinventing itself by adopting many of the most vulgar features of modern showbiz or sports celebrity.
And the worlds of royalty and popular fame often overlap.
For example, David Beckham and his ex-pop-star wife Victoria, live out their own dream of royalty, aping some of its gaudiest aspects.
They also happened to be among the favored guests at the latest royal wedding.
Similarly, while Britain has many outstanding musicians, the favorite of the royal court is Elton John.
Infantile or not, there is a common human craving for taking vicarious pleasure in the lives of kings, queens, and other shining stars.
To call these people’s ostentatious displays of extravagance wasteful is to miss the point: a world of glittering dreams that must remain entirely beyond our grasp is precisely what many people want to see.
But there is another, darker side to this craving, which is the wish to see idols dragged through the mud in vicious gossip magazines, divorce courts, and so on. This is the vengeful side of our fawning, as though the humiliation of worshipping idols must be balanced by our delight in their downfall.
Indeed, to subject people who are born into royal families, or people who marry into them, to lives in a fishbowl, where they are on constant display, like actors and actresses in a continuous soap opera, where human relations are distorted and stunted by absurd rules of protocol, is a terrible form of cruelty.
The current Japanese empress and her daughter-in-law, both from non-aristocratic families, have had nervous breakdowns as a result.
Likewise, movie stars often fall victim to alcohol, drugs, and breakdowns, but at least they have chosen the lives they live.
Kings and queens, on the whole, have not.
Prince Charles might have been far happier as a gardener, but this was never an option.
One thing to be said for monarchs is that they provide people with a sense of continuity, which can be useful in times of crisis or radical change.
The King of Spain provided stability and continuity after the end of Franco’s dictatorship.
During World War II, European monarchs kept a sense of hope and unity alive among their subjects under Nazi occupation.
But there is something else, too.
Monarchies are often popular with minorities.
Jews were among the most loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor.
Franz Joseph I stood up for his Jewish subjects when they were threatened by German anti-Semites.
To him, Jews, Germans, Czechs, or Hungarians were all his subjects, wherever they lived, from the smallest Galician shtetl to the grand capitals of Budapest or Vienna.
This offered some protection to minorities at a time of rising ethnic nationalism.
In this sense, monarchy is a little like Islam, or the Catholic Church: all believers are supposed to be equal in the eyes of God, or the Pope, or the Emperor – hence the appeal to the poor and the marginalized.
This might explain some right-wing populists’ animus against monarchy.
The Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders, for example, has denounced Queen Beatrix on several occasions as a leftist, elitist, and multiculturalist.
Like the new wave of populists worldwide, Wilders promises to take his country back for his followers, to stop immigration (especially of Muslims), and to make the Netherlands Dutch again, whatever that means.
Beatrix, like Franz Joseph, refuses to make ethnic or religious distinctions between her subjects.
That is what she means when she preaches tolerance and mutual understanding.
To Wilders and his supporters, this is a sign of her molly-coddling of aliens, of appeasing Muslims.
To them, the queen seems almost anti-Dutch.
To be sure, like all European royal families, the origins of the Dutch royal family are decidedly mixed.
The emergence of kings and queens as specifically national figureheads is a relatively recent historical development.
Empires contained many nations, after all.
Queen Victoria, mostly of German blood, did not regard herself as a monarch of Britons alone, but of Indians, Malays, and many other peoples, too.
This aristocratic tradition of standing above the narrow strains of ethnic nationalism may be the best argument to hang on to royalty a little longer.
Now that many European nations have become increasingly mixed in terms of ethnicity and culture, the only way forward is to learn to live together.
If monarchs can teach their subjects to do so, then let us give at least one cheer for the remaining kings and queens.

The Islamic Case for Religious Liberty
ANKARA – Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of the Orthodox Church recently said on American TV that he feels “crucified” in Turkey, upsetting many Turks. Sadly, his Holiness is right. Yet his complaint is not with Islam but with the secular Turkish Republic.
The Turkish state has kept the Halki Seminary, the only institution able to train Orthodox priests, closed since 1971.
Even the Patriarch’s title “ecumenical” is lashed out at by some Turkish authorities and their nationalist supporters.
Every year, international reports on religious freedom point to such pressures on the Patriarchate with concern, and they are right to do so. But why does Turkey do all this?
What is the source of the problem?
Things were better long ago.
The first Turkish ruler to reign over the Ecumenical Patriarchate was Mehmed II, the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453.
In line with the Islamic tradition of accepting the “People of the Book,” the young sultan granted amnesty to the patriarchate.
He also gave the institution many privileges and authorities, no less than that which existed under the Byzantine emperors.
Armenians and Jews later enjoyed the same autonomies.
In the 19th century, the non-Muslim peoples of the empire also achieved the rights of equal citizenship with Muslims.
That’s why the late Ottoman bureaucracy and the Ottoman Parliament included a great number of Greeks, Armenians and Jews — something you never see in republican Turkey.
The Halki Seminary, opened in 1844, is a relic from that bygone age of pluralism.
Nationalism is what destroyed this Pax Ottomana.
It affected the peoples of the empire one by one, including, towards the end, the Turks.
Many conflicts took place between the latter and the rest, and the great empire’s colossal collapse left a bitter taste in the mouths of all.
The Armenians, who suffered the worst tragedy in 1915, never forgot nor forgave.
What the Turks remember, however, was the perceived “treason” of the other components of the empire, especially that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The latter had cheered the Greek armies when they invaded western Anatolia in 1919.
From that point on, the Patriarchate, in the eyes of many Turks, became a “fifth column.”
When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic in 1923, he defined the Patriarchate as “a center of perfidy.”
As an alternative, he promoted a rival “Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate,” which became a bastion of ultra-nationalist ideology.
(Some members of this artificial "Patriarchate" are currently on trial in the so-called Ergenekon case, a covert network of officers and civilians accused at conspiring to stage a military coup against the current Turkish government.)
Over the years, Atatürk’s ideas evolved into an official ideology called “Kemalism,” which had two main pillars: A self-styled secularism that bans anything but “the secular way of life,” and a fierce nationalism that defies anything it deems “non-Turkish.”
The Ecumenical Patriarchate, as both a religious and “non-Turkish” institution, fits in neither category.
Hence, throughout the Republican regime, and especially at times of military dominance, it faced official pressure and confiscation of property, as did all other non-Muslim and Muslim religious institutions.
So part of the problem is the curse of history.
But you can either trap yourself inside history or take lessons from it and move on.
To date, unfortunately, Turkey’s nationalists, within both state and society, have opted for the former option.
If one cause of the repression of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is nationalism, though, the other one is the other pillar of the Kemalist ideology: secularism.
Turkey’ draconian laws on “national education” ban any sort of religious education unless it is strictly controlled by the state.
The real motive behind this is the regime’s distaste for Islam.
The Ecumenical Patriarchate, as a foreign observer observes, only receives “collateral damage.”
A telling manifestation of this was seen recently in a live discussion on CNNTurk, the Turkish counterpart of the international news channel.
A deputy from the CHP, the staunchly Kemalist People’s Republican Party, Muharrem İnce, who opposed the reopening of the Halki Seminary became angry. “Do you know who most wants to open the seminary in this country,” he loudly asked.
“The Islamists!
They want this, because they want to open Islamic schools as well.”
Yes, this is indeed the position increasingly adopted by Turkey’s Islamic opinion leaders — who are striving not for jihad or an “Islamic state,” but just a modest preservation of tradition.
They realize that religious freedom must be championed for all.
And they have a good frame of reference in the pluralism of the Ottomans.
This more liberal approach to non-Muslims can be observed in today’s AKP (Justice and Development Party) government, in power since 2002.
Although labeled as “Islamist” by its opponents, the AKP has been much more willing to liberalize Turkey than its secular counterparts, most of which are zealously nationalist. The Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom makes this point nicely:
“In November 2006, the [AKP dominated] Turkish parliament, as part of the reforms related to possible EU accession, passed a new law governing Lausanne religious minority foundations, easing procedures to establish foundations and allowing non-Turkish citizens in Turkey to open them… Then President Ahmet Necdet Sezer [a staunch Kemalist], however, vetoed the legislation.
In February 2008, the parliament passed a similar law on the return of property confiscated from non-Muslim minorities...
President Gül signed the legislation, which was also supported by Prime Minister Erdogan, but was vehemently opposed by Turkish nationalists on the grounds that the law granted too many rights to minority communities.”
The Ecumenical Patriarch himself acknowledged in a recent interview that the AKP has shown goodwill on this issue.
His All Holiness also said that the real obstacle is probably “the deep state” — a reference to Turkey’s Kemalist state establishment that considers itself above any elected government and democratic law.

The Iran Nuclear Deal Is Bad – and Necessary
TEL AVIV – US President Donald Trump has refused to certify the nuclear agreement with Iran, launching a process by which the US Congress could re-impose sanctions on the country.
Fortunately, it seems likely that Congress, rather than pulling the plug on the deal, will seek some alternative that allows Trump to save face with his supporters, to whom he has long promised US withdrawal from the Iran deal.
Nonetheless, decertification is a serious mistake.
Like many Israelis, I agree with Trump that the international agreement reached with Iran in 2015 is fundamentally a bad deal.
But it is also a done deal.
Even if the United States does decide to withdraw from it completely, none of the other parties – not China or Russia or even the Europeans (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) – will follow suit.
Iran would continue to reap the agreement’s benefits.
At the same time, however, Iran could view the US decision to renege on the deal as justification for reviving its halted nuclear program.
After all, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act authorizes the US president to decertify the deal if Iran violates its terms. And, at least technically, Iran has done no such thing.
Of course, Iran’s behavior – developing powerful ballistic missiles, helping to spread terror across the Middle East, and running intensive cyber warfare campaigns – is deeply troubling, and measures should be taken to apply pressure on Iran to address these issues.
But none of them was part of the nuclear deal.
In this context, if Trump does decertify the Iran deal right now, it will undermine America’s credibility when it comes to reining in another nuclear threat: North Korea.
If the US can default on its international commitments for no reason, why would Kim Jong-un bother to engage in negotiations?
Kim might be an extremist of the first order, but his motivations are easy to discern.
He views nuclear weapons as the ultimate insurance against a steep and ignominious fall, like those of Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein.
Moreover, however mighty the US military is, it cannot destroy North Korea’s nuclear arsenal without provoking a counterattack inflicting untold destruction on South Korea and perhaps also Japan – both close US allies.
That gives Kim substantial leverage.
The only possible way to deter Kim is through coercive diplomacy that compels him to freeze his nuclear program at something like its current level.
And it was just this sort of coercive diplomacy, backed by sanctions and a united position among major international actors, that compelled Iran to sign its own deal.
If such diplomacy loses its credibility, Kim will inevitably continue to expand his nuclear-weapons program, and global risks will rise exponentially – not least because neighbors like South Korea and Japan will be increasingly eager to develop their own nuclear weapons.
With that, the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament – a goal that the US has pursued for almost 70 years – will be all but dead.
The most immediate threat would be a decision by Iran to relaunch its own nuclear-weapon program.
Should that happen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey would be virtually certain to pursue nuclear breakout.
In fact, any third-rate dictator in the world watching these developments might decide to pursue nuclear weapons.
The entire global order would be fundamentally changed.
North Korea is the proverbial horse that has broken the stable door and bolted.
But, thanks to the current agreement, the Iranian horse remains in the barn.
The US should be attempting to corral North Korea, not giving Iran reason to bolt, too.
This does not mean that the US needs to be passive.
In fact, the US should be preparing for a potential future Iranian nuclear breakout – a distinct possibility, even if the current deal is upheld.
Iran would be unlikely to pursue nuclear breakout immediately, because the deal still affords it substantial benefits.
A few years from now, however, those benefits would be largely secured, giving Iran less reason to stick to its promises.
Given this, rather than parting ways with the other parties that helped to negotiate the agreement, the US should be seeking a consensus on what would constitute an Iranian breakout, in order to help guide the inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The US should also coordinate with the agreement’s other signatories regarding the sanctions and other punishments that would be meted out if Iran actually did breach the deal.
For any of this to work, however, the “big American stick” must be present.
The US must be prepared, in terms of intelligence, weapons, and political will, to intervene – unilaterally, if needed – to stop Iran, should it try to follow in North Korea’s footsteps.
Deal or no deal, Iran represents a serious threat – to Israel, of course, but also to the stability of the Middle East and, in a sense, of the whole world.
But, as of now, that threat is not existential.
Preventing it from becoming so should be a top priority today.
We in Israel who have been thinking seriously about this challenge for some time – not to mention working hard to prepare ourselves for various contingencies – recognize that, for now, our security is best served by maintaining the current deal.
Over the last 25 years, six countries have tried to turn themselves into nuclear states.
Two of them – Libya and South Africa – gave up.
Another two – Syria and Iraq – were stopped.
And two – Pakistan and North Korea – succeeded, in defiance of the international community.
We must ensure that Iran is not allowed to join their ranks.
And, so long as Iran remains compliant, the nuclear deal, however bad it is, remains our best chance to do just that.

Dying to Live
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE – I was a young medical officer working at the Emergency Unit of the Ola During Children’s Hospital in Sierra Leone when I advised the mother of a child with severe malaria to tell a blatant lie.
Her daughter Mariama needed a life-saving blood transfusion.
But her mother had no money to pay for the screening tests and to compensate the blood donor.
I had seen many children die while their parents frantically sought the necessary funds.
Determined to save Mariama’s life, I told her mother to go home and announce the death of her daughter.
I knew this would provoke the sympathy of her relatives, and they would scrape together their meager resources to ensure a proper funeral.
The mother agreed, and when she returned six hours later, she threw enough money on the table to cover all of Mariama’s care: a blood transfusion and treatment for malaria and worm infestation.
A few days later, I discharged the still weak but recovering four-year-old from the hospital.
Though Mariama’s illness did not move her relatives to action, her death did.
The same thing happened, on a much larger scale, during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
It is believed that the epidemic first took hold in the forested regions of Guinea in December 2013, then gradually spread into Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The international community watched as the disease ravaged the three countries, decimating villages, wiping out entire families, and bringing economies to a standstill.
But, at the start, it attracted little attention.
The international community was content to ignore the truth, until the epidemic had become so widespread that they no longer could.
By then, however, it was too late to avert a major catastrophe.
We are still learning the full extent of the Ebola disaster in West Africa.
For fear of catching the disease, schools were closed, with students and teachers staying at home.
Indeed, many workers stayed home as well, causing restaurants, bars, and hotels to cease functioning and the economy to grind to a halt.
Half of all private-sector jobs were lost.
Farmers’ self-isolation led to a 30% drop in agricultural output.
People’s social lives stalled as well. A curfew was imposed in many districts, and long-distance travel was discouraged.
In several towns, accepting a visitor into your home meant the risk of a heavy fine.
Nonetheless, the disease spread into urban areas and, like a wildfire, engulfed the three countries and spilled into others.
To date, more than 8,500 infections and 3,500 deaths have been reported just in Sierra Leone.
The health sector has perhaps been the hardest hit.
The death of more than 220 health-care workers left only 3.4 skilled health personnel for every 10,000 citizens.
As fear of Ebola mounted, many citizens stopped using health services, reflected in a 23% drop in births in hospitals or clinics, a 21% drop in children receiving basic immunization, and a 39% drop in children treated for malaria.
As a result, these countries experienced a resurgence in vaccine-preventable diseases, malaria, maternal and child deaths, and acute malnutrition.
In this sense, the worst may be yet to come.
But Sierra Leone is picking up the pieces, and has embarked on a two-year recovery plan.
The first priority is to get the number of Ebola cases to zero and keep it there.
This means changing the conditions that allowed it to spread so rapidly in the first place.
The first step is to rebuild the health-care system.
The plan demands the restoration of health-care services in 40 hospitals and 1,300 primary health-care facilities across the country, so that children and mothers can receive free essential care, vaccinations, and treatment for diseases like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria.
Moreover, in order to bolster safety – and restore confidence – in the health-care system, the plan calls for better infection-control practices and training for a new cadre of skilled workers.
And it includes closer cooperation with community groups, which should be engaged in disease surveillance and response.
The post-Ebola recovery will not be quick, easy, or cheap.
In Sierra Leone alone, it is expected to cost $1.3 billion – $896.2 million of which has yet to be procured.
To close that gap, we need help from our African partners and the broader international community.
Many years ago, without the help of a lie, Mariama would have died.
Today, we do not need lies.
We need genuine engagement, open communication, and mutual accountability, at the local, national, regional, and global levels.
We have already seen how a lack of essential health-care services can devastate a country, taking thousands of lives and shattering many more.
We came together as a country to beat Ebola, and we are committed to prevent future epidemics.
With ongoing international support, we will do just that.

The Tabloid Syndrome
The world is a complex and intricate place.
So how are we to understand even just a piece of it, say, the United States government and its economic policies? It is a big problem, for the standard sources that I was taught as a child to rely upon – newspapers and television news – are breaking down.
For example, in early February 2004, the then Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, N. Gregory Mankiw, spent some time trying to explain the issues surrounding “outsourcing” to America’s elite political news reporters.
Mankiw’s standard description of outsourcing is very much like mine – indeed, like that of all neoclassical and neoliberal economists – and goes something like this:
As with any change in technology that increases the volume of international trade in goods and services, the outsourcing of service-sector jobs creates winners and losers – but almost surely more and bigger winners than losers.
Big winners are workers in poor countries who get better jobs working for firms that can now export services to rich countries.
The major losers are those who previously held the now-outsourced service-sector jobs; they must now find new and different jobs and almost surely find that their skills are worth less.
But even in the US, losers’ losses are outweighed by winners’ gains.
Workers in certain industries find their skills in higher demand as foreigners spend their increased dollar earnings, consumers benefit from lower prices, and shareholders and managers see their companies’ profits increase.
However much we may worry about the distributional consequences of outsourcing, we should never overlook the fact that it increases the total size of the economic pie.
Mankiw made that argument, but he failed to be understood.
Indeed, on February 10, 2004, he woke up to an unpleasant news story in the Washington Post: ”President Bush’s top economist yesterday said the outsourcing of US service jobs to workers overseas is good for the nation’s economy....
Mankiw’s comments come as the president struggles to shore up support in manufacturing states that have lost millions of jobs....Mankiw’s conclusions may prove discordant during an election year...”
It happened again on February 11: “Democrats...lit into President Bush’s chief economist yesterday for his laudatory statements on the movement of U.S. jobs abroad....
Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.) called for the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw...”
Of course, the Washington Post’s journalists know, on some level, that they were being unfair to Mankiw.
They didn’t claim that what he said was inaccurate, or shortsighted, or analytically unsound.
The descriptive terms they used – “discordant,” “embarrassing,” “political liability” – suggest that they knew they were giving Mankiw a raw deal.
But was there any sign of the standard economic analysis of outsourcing in their stories?
Not one.
Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its “2004 Economic Report of the President.”
But the last thing the reporters wanted to do was to convey a thumbnail summary of Mankiw’s analysis of outsourcing.
That’s simply not the business they saw themselves as being in.
The problem is not that the Washington Post and papers like it hire people who are unintelligent or lazy. The problem is that conveying accurate information about the economy is far down the list of priorities for normal news reporters.
Making a splash matters.
So does keeping track of who is up politically and who is down. So does pleasing your editors so that they’ll give your stories better placement, and pleasing your sources so that they’ll keep talking to you.
Compared to these imperatives, there is little to be gained from informing the public about how the economy really functions and about the dilemmas of economic policy.
Indeed, the economy is vastly inferior to Hollywood as a source of glitterati gossip, but much economic reporting makes the coverage of the birth of Brad Pitt’s and Angelina Jolie’s baby look profoundly serious.
Likewise, government is vastly inferior to the World Cup as a sporting spectacle, but much political reporting focuses on who played well and who played badly.
What can we do about this?
The answer is simple, and it is a matter of demand, not supply.
After all, few people go into journalism to deliberately mislead the public.
If we demand better economic and political journalism the way we demand excellent coverage of the World Cup, we’ll get it.

Kenya’s Somali Contradiction
NAIROBI – The attack that killed more than 70 people at Nairobi’s Westgate shopping mall last week was, according to al-Shabaab, the Somali Islamist militant group that carried it out, retribution for Kenya’s intervention in Somalia.
That raises a simple question: What is Kenya doing in Somalia, and is it worth the price?
Since Kenya’s army invaded its northeastern neighbor two years ago, the government has told Kenyans that they were going to war against al-Shabaab.
But, as with most official pronouncements in Kenya, that story was only partly true.
On the night of October 15, 2011, I lay awake listening to the Kenyan military convoys passing through the border town of Dadaab on their way to Somalia to launch the first foreign military campaign in Kenya’s history.
The proximate cause was the abduction of two Spanish aid workers from the vast refugee camps that encircle Dadaab.
For the Kenyan authorities, it was the final straw after a series of abductions of Westerners by al-Shabaab; to stop the incursions, they launched what military leaders believed would be a quick campaign.
Over the last two years, some progress has ostensibly been made.
The two Spanish aid workers were released last July, and al-Shabaab has attempted only one abduction since.
Moreover, the rebels have been dislodged from the southern Somali port of Kismayo, which was once their main base.
But al-Shabaab retains control of the majority of Somalia and remains capable of striking Mogadishu, the capital, as well as Nairobi.
Given this, if the Kenyan government’s aim was, as it claimed, to destroy al-Shabaab, the intervention has been a spectacular failure.
But there is much more to the story.
In fact, retaliation against the militant group was little more than a convenient excuse to launch the so-called Jubaland Initiative, a plan to protect Kenya’s security and economic interests by carving out a semi-autonomous client state in southern Somalia.
While knowledge of the plan was initially confined largely to Kenyan government officials, it was not long before its contours began to be revealed.
Kenya has installed a client regime in Kismayo, and has supported the new government in its quest to make Jubaland a semi-autonomous region, along the lines of Puntland, Somaliland, and the many other self-declared proto-states that have emerged as Somalia has unraveled.
Beyond preventing Somalia’s violence from spilling over into Kenya and undermining its security and its tourist-driven economy, such a buffer state could be forced to absorb the half-million Somali refugees who now live in Dadaab’s refugee camps.
In this sense, the Jubaland Initiative is a policy of stunning racial profiling – and a gift to al-Shabaab recruiters in Kenya.
Furthermore, contrary to claims that securing Kismayo put al-Shabaab at a disadvantage, the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea reported in July that the Kenyan Defense Forces have actually gone into business with al-Shabaab.
The group’s profits from illicit charcoal (and possibly ivory) exported from Kismayo have grown since Kenya took control.
This highlights a fundamental problem: the Kenyan state’s endemic corruption constantly undermines its policymakers’ goals.
Indeed, in Kismayo, Kenyan officials have reverted to their default occupation – the pursuit of private profit.
Instead of working to achieve the diplomatic objective of defeating al-Shabaab, Kenya’s military, politicians, and well-connected businessmen have been lining their own pockets.
Moreover, Kenya’s desire to carve out a buffer state conflicts with the Somali government’s goal of uniting the country.
Indeed, the last thing the government in Mogadishu wants is another semi-autonomous region challenging its authority – or another country annexing southern Somalia for its own purposes.
The United States and the European Union – which are bankrolling the African Union’s intervention in Somalia to support the Mogadishu-based government – have attempted to paper over the disagreement with Kenya over the Jubaland Initiative, despite its potential to fuel further conflict.
In fact, Kenya-backed Jubaland forces clashed with Somali government troops in Kismayo earlier this year.
The Westgate attack should spur Kenya’s leaders to re-think their approach toward Somalia.
A more coherent strategy would involve cutting off al-Shabaab’s funding and addressing the grievances – such as human-rights abuses against Somalis, discrimination against Muslims, foreign meddling in Somalia, and corruption – that motivate its recruits.
In a bizarre twist, al-Shabaab even called on Kenyans to prosecute their leaders for post-election bloodletting in 2007-2008.
Given these intractable grievances – and, more important, the weakness and corruption of the Kenyan state – the cycle of violence will be very difficult to break. That is why the attack on the Westgate mall is unlikely to be the last such tragedy.

Bolivia’s Crisis, Latin America’s Failure
Bolivia is not a typical Latin American country by any definition.
But for Haiti, it is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, and it is even less stable, with a history of more than two hundred coups since independence.
In a region with a strong indigenous past but a scattered and isolated present, Bolivia is, alongside Guatemala, perhaps the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples make up a majority of the population.
Its topography and ethnic distribution are generating autonomist and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in more menacing ways than anywhere else.
And, of course, it is, with Paraguay, the only land-locked nation on the sub-continent.
So it would be highly imprudent to extrapolate Bolivia’s current crisis to the rest of Latin America.
It is far too simple to generalize: institutions elsewhere are much stronger, poverty – and particularly extreme poverty – have been diminishing, and the battle over natural resources has been largely settled.
Even in places like Venezuela, with both huge oil reserves and a traditional-minded nationalist government, the status quo allowing for foreign investment in energy resources has survived nearly eight years of President Hugo Chavez.
While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from Chiapas to “Araucania,” from Amazonia to Ayacucho, nowhere in Latin America have they posed a genuine threat to national integrity.
So Bolivia is not a premonitory crisis; nor does the hoary old “domino theory,” to which both Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara subscribed in the case of Bolivia, seem valid or even half-way reasonable.
Yet Bolivia’s current crisis does point to the “democratic deficit” that plagues Latin America today.
Elected leaders have fallen for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Haiti.
Democracy is either defective or missing in Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua, and it is threatened by one cause or another in Venezuela and Colombia.
None of these cases are identical to the others; they include varying degrees of danger, harm, or reconciliation.
The question is what can be done about this state of affairs, which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed just a few years back.
At the last Organization of American States assembly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the United States delegation took a good idea from others and, by its support, essentially sank it.
The story began a couple of years ago, when former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and the United Nations Development Program were charged with drafting the Latin American Democracy Report.
They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate action before matters got out of control, as in Bolivia today.
Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues.
He did, but the initiative did not get very far.
In fact, The UNDP/Latin America Democracy Report, published in 2004, barely mentioned it.
The US and the new Chilean Secretary General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, resurrected the plan during the OAS meeting in Florida, but it was shot down by Latin Americans’ reasonable fears that the idea was directed against Venezuela, mingled with Latin Americans’ anachronistic fears of violating the sacrosanct principle of non-intervention.
Despite the continent’s failure to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves attention.
Today there may be little that the hemispheric community can do about the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is fraught with danger for everyone.
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers, may be an honest, if misguided, democratic leader, but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires?
Hugo Chavez may not be financing Morales and Bolivia’s other dissidents, but are Venezuela and Cuba really not tempted to meddle in the country where Che Guevara died leading a guerrilla war nearly 40 years ago?
Bolivia’s Santa Cruz business community may not carry out its threat to secede, but will they prefer to share their region’s oil and gas reserves with the indigenous highland peoples rather than with Brazilian industrialists from São Paulo?
Before events reached these extremes, it might have been a good idea for the OAS (not the US) to get involved.
The region continues to need that involvement – on time, on message, and on a proper democratic platform, one that is distinct from both traditional US intervention and Latin America’s traditional indifference.

Where the Water Is
HAMILTON, CANADA – In many parts of the world, there are simply no more conventional freshwater resources available to meet growing demand.
Beyond limiting economic development, the lack of sufficient freshwater resources threatens the wellbeing of billions of people by causing conflict, social unrest, and migration.
The only way to address this challenge is by radically rethinking water-resource planning and management in a way that emphasizes the creative exploitation of unconventional water sources.
There is a large and growing number of unconventional sources of fresh water with massive potential, beginning with desalinated seawater or highly brackish groundwater.
Already, there are 18,000 desalination facilities in more than 100 countries producing roughly 32 billion cubic meters (8.45 trillion gallons) of fresh water – about one-third of the volume passing over Niagara Falls annually.
Some 44% of global desalinated-water production is taking place in the Middle East and North Africa, and new facilities are being built across Asia, the United States, and Latin America.
Annual desalination capacity worldwide is increasing by 7-9%, on average.
Recent studies show that, though the cost of irrigation with desalinated water remains higher than with conventional fresh water, it is declining.
A couple of decades ago, desalinated water cost more than $5 per cubic meter (264 gallons); today, it costs less than $0.50.
A second promising alternative source of fresh water is fog: a vertical mesh can be used to capture moisture from the air, with the droplets accumulating in a tank or distribution system.
Given that fog is very common even in dry areas, fog-harvesting systems amount to a practical, cost-effective way to deliver fresh water directly to rural communities.
Some countries are already taking advantage of this technology.
In Cape Verde, a square meter of a collection system yields up to 12 liters (3.2 gallons) of fresh water daily in peak season.
In Eritrea, a 1,600-square-meter net harvests up to 12,000 liters per day.
The world’s largest fog collection and distribution system was built in 2015 in the mountains of Morocco – an area with low water availability but abundant fog six months out of the year.
Fog harvesting today costs $1-3 per cubic meter of water.
Costs are expected to decrease further as the market for equipment grows and as more village populations take charge of operations and maintenance.
Given their simplicity, fog-harvesting systems have minimal running costs and are easily managed by unskilled teams.
Similarly, “micro-catchment rainwater harvesting” – which uses particular slopes and contours to increase runoff from rain and concentrate it in a planting basin where it is effectively “stored” in the soil – is useful for dryland ecosystems where most precipitation is lost.
Several projects in the Middle East and North Africa demonstrate the potential of this approach to sustain vegetation growth in very dry areas.
Yet another unconventional source of freshwater is used greywater and wastewater from urban areas.
Mechanisms for safely collecting, treating, and reusing such water have been demonstrated and documented, with stringent effluent-discharge regulations in North America, Northern Europe, and Japan setting an example for the world.
Groundwater confined in deep geological formations and in offshore aquifers may also be tapped.
A final – and particularly surprising – potential option, which the United Arab Emirates is now exploring, is iceberg towage.
While Canada’s oil and gas industry regularly tows icebergs to avoid damage to offshore platforms, for the UAE, keeping ice intact over a 10,000-kilometer (6,200-mile) southward journey, which can take up to a year, is no easy feat.
But, given how much water is locked in an average-size iceberg, it is worth consideration.
Despite the demonstrated promise of unconventional water sources, not to mention the urgency of the water challenge in many countries, the potential of these solutions remains woefully underexplored.
While most water-scarce countries regulate the use of desalinated water, decision-makers need to update their investment strategies, water-management policies, and public budgets to integrate the full range of water resources.
To this end, governments must abandon their outdated assumption that tapping unconventional water sources would be technically impractical or excessively costly.
Efforts should be made to analyze the potential benefits of such investment, taking into account the economic, social, environmental, and health trade-offs of water scarcity.
Governments must also clarify the responsibilities of national water agencies and improve the capacity of water-related institutions at all levels to institute large-scale unconventional-water programs.
Best practices should be clarified, innovations identified and tested, and knowledge and experience shared.
The private sector also has a role to play in the shift toward unconventional water resources – a role that must extend beyond current efforts to tap desalinated water and urban greywater and wastewater.
Finally, local institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and local communities must be mobilized – for example, through public campaigns showcasing the benefits of harnessing the potential of unconventional water resources.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 calls for universal access to clean water and sanitation.
If governments do not embrace unconventional water resources, achieving that goal will be as difficult as getting water from a stone – and the consequences for water-scarce regions will be dire.

Is Goodness Natural?
It is hard to imagine that anyone thinks of goodness as a problem, but Charles Darwin did.
The little worker bees that sacrificed themselves to protect their hives – the ultimate example of animal goodness – kept Darwin up at night.
Given Darwin’s ideas about evolution natural selection were correct (and, of course, they were and are), then this sort of altruism should be extraordinarily rare in nature.
If increased reproduction is the ultimate end all and be all of evolution by natural selection, then altruists should disappear – and fast.
But they don’t disappear, and Darwin was so puzzled by this that he spoke of altruism as a problem that could prove fatal to his whole theory of evolution.
Then a solution to this nasty conundrum hit Darwin like a ton of bricks.
Worker bees weren’t helping just any old bunch of bees; they were protecting their hive. And their hive contained special individuals: blood relatives.
Blood relatives are, by definition, very similar to one another.
So even though the little worker bees may have been giving up their lives, by doing so they were potentially saving hundreds of blood relatives.
In modern parlance, we’d say that the worker bees were helping blood kin, because blood kin are genetically related.
By helping your blood relatives, you are indirectly promoting the reproduction of copies of your own genes - copies that just happen to reside inside your kin.
Darwin wasn’t the only scientist who was fascinated with the question of the evolution of goodness.
In fact, his good friend and colleague, Thomas Henry Huxley, was as well.
Huxley, in fact, got himself into quite a heated argument over whether blood kinship could or could not explain altruism.
Huxley’s opponent was Prince Peter Kropotkin, ex-page to the Czar of Russia, naturalist, and arguably the most famous anarchist of the nineteenth century. Huxley argued that all goodness could be traced to blood kinship, while Kropotkin argued that goodness and blood kinship were completely divorced from one another - one had nothing to do with the each other.
Of course, neither was right, but it would take almost a hundred years before a shy, reserved, and brilliant British biologist named William D. Hamilton would settle all the arguments about blood kinship and altruism by coming up with a simple, but elegant mathematical equation.
Instead of asking if blood kinship explains everything or nothing about altruism, Hamilton approached the question differently.
He began by defining three terms: the genetic relatedness between individuals (labeled r), the cost of an act of goodness (c), and the benefit that a recipient obtained when someone was nice to him or her (b).
Using some beautiful mathematics, in the early 1960’s Hamilton discovered that altruism and blood kinship are not linked by an all- or- nothing relationship.
Instead, what is now known as “Hamilton’s Rule” states that altruism evolves whenever r times b is greater than c. In other words, if enough relatives receive benefits from altruism to outweigh the cost of altruism, then altruism spreads; otherwise, it does not.
Phrased in the cold language of natural selection, blood relatives are worth helping in direct proportion to their genetic (blood) relatedness, weighted by how great a benefit they received.
Literally thousands of experiments with both nonhumans and humans show the power of Hamilton’s Rule.
This little equation is evolutionary biology’s version of e = mc2.
Over and over, we see that an analysis of the costs and benefits of altruism, along with the genetic relatedness of interactants, allows us to predict the presence or absence of altruism.
Hamilton’s Rule, of course, does not explain all altruism.
Another large chunk of goodness falls under the category of “reciprocity.”
Individuals are sometimes willing to be altruistic to someone now in the expectation that they will, in turn, be helped when we they need it.
Evolutionary biologists have been almost as interested in this type of altruism, as they have been in kinship-based altruism.
Amazingly enough, it was Bill Hamilton, along with the political scientist Robert Axelrod and the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers, who formalized the models behind the evolution of reciprocity.
Following up on work done by Trivers in the early 1970’s, in 1981, Axelrod and Hamilton used the mathematics of game theory to predict when so-called “reciprocal altruism” should evolve.
Again, scores of empirical studies have followed up the model.
Reciprocity can be complex, but an evolutionary perspective has cleared the path to understanding, just the same way it did in the case of blood kinship and altruism.
If goodness is a problem, then the answer – or at the least part of the answer – can be found in evolutionary biology.

America’s Strategy Vacuum
NEW HAVEN – Apparently, policymakers at the Federal Reserve are having second thoughts about the wisdom of open-ended quantitative easing (QE).
They should.
Not only has this untested policy experiment failed to deliver an acceptable economic recovery; it has also heightened the risk of another crisis.
The minutes of the January 29-30 meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) speak to a simmering discontent: “[M]any participants…expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases.”
The concerns range from worries about the destabilizing ramifications of an exit strategy from QE to apprehension about capital losses on the Fed’s rapidly ballooning portfolio of securities (currently $3 trillion, and on its way to $4 trillion by the end of this year).
As serious as these concerns may be, they overlook what could well be the greatest flaw in the Fed’s unprecedented gambit: an emphasis on short-term tactics over longer-term strategy.
Blindsided by the crisis of 2007-2008, the Fed has compounded its original misdiagnosis of the problem by repeatedly doubling down on tactical responses, with two rounds of QE preceding the current, open-ended iteration.
The FOMC, drawing a false sense of comfort from the success of QE1 – a massive liquidity injection in the depths of a horrific crisis – mistakenly came to believe that it had found the right template for subsequent policy actions.
That approach might have worked had the US economy been afflicted by a cyclical disease – a temporary shortfall of aggregate demand.
In that case, countercyclical policies – both fiscal and monetary – could eventually be expected to plug the demand hole and get the economy going again, just as Keynesians argue.
But the US is not suffering from a temporary, cyclical malady.
It is afflicted by a very different disease: a protracted balance-sheet recession that continues to hobble American households, whose consumption accounts for roughly 70% of GDP.
Two bubbles – property and credit – against which American families borrowed freely, have long since burst.
But the aftershocks linger: Household-debt loads were still at 113% of disposable personal income in 2012 (versus 75% in the final three decades of the twentieth century), and the personal-saving rate averaged just 3.9% last year (compared to 7.9% from 1970 to 1999).
Understandably fixated on balance-sheet repair, US consumers have not taken the bait from their monetary and fiscal authorities. Instead, they have cut back on spending.
Gains in inflation-adjusted personal-consumption expenditure have averaged a mere 0.8% over the past five years – the most severe and protracted slowdown in consumer demand growth in the post-World War II era.
The brute force of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus rings hollow as a cyclical remedy to this problem.
Another approach is needed.
The focus, instead, should be on accelerating the process of balance-sheet repair, while at the same time returning monetary and fiscal policy levers to more normal settings.
Forgiveness of “underwater” mortgages (where the outstanding loan exceeds the home’s current market value), as well as reducing the foreclosure overhang of some 1.5 million homes, must be part of that solution.
How else can the crisis-battered housing market finally clear for the remainder of US homeowners?
The same can be said for enhanced saving incentives, which would contribute to longer-term financial security for American households, most of which suffered massive wealth losses in the Great Recession.
Expanded individual retirement accounts and 401K pension schemes, special incentives for low-income households (most of which have no retirement plans), and an end to the financial repression that the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy imposes on savers must also be part of the solution.
Yes, these are controversial policies.
Debt forgiveness raises thorny ethical concerns about condoning reckless and irresponsible behavior.
But converting underwater “non-recourse” mortgage loans, where only the house is at risk, into so-called “recourse liabilities,” for which nonpayment would have consequences for all of a borrower’s assets, could address this concern, while simultaneously tempering America’s culture of leverage with a much greater sense of responsibility.
Timing is also an issue, especially with respect to saving incentives.
To avoid the shortfall in aggregate demand that might arise from an abrupt surge in saving, these measures should be phased in over a period of 3-5 years.
The main benefit of these proposals is that they are more strategic than tactical – better aligned with the balance-sheet problems that are actually afflicting the economy.
As the quintessential laissez-faire system, the US has outsourced strategy to the invisible hand of the market for far too long. That has left the government locked into a reactive and often misguided approach to unexpected problems.
Thus, the Fed is focused on cleaning up after a crisis rather than on how to avoid another one.
The same is true of US fiscal policy, with an event-driven debate that now has ever-shorter time horizons: the fiscal cliff on January 1, sequestration of expenditures on March 1, expiration of the continuing budget resolution on March 27, and the new May 18 debt-ceiling limit.
A compliant bond market, which may well be the next bubble, is mistakenly viewed as the ultimate validation of this myopic approach.
The dangers of America’s strategy vacuum and the related penchant for short-termism have been mounting for some time.
Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously raised this concern in a 1996 article in the Harvard Business Review.
His focus was on corporate decision-making and misaligned incentives leading to a worrisome dichotomy between the short-term tactics of “operational effectiveness” (cost cutting, outsourcing, and reengineering) and the long-term visionary bets that frame successful strategies.
While Porter’s critique was directed at business managers, it bears critically on the current US policy debate. A successful long-term strategy cannot be seen as a succession of short-term fixes.
The internal debate in the FOMC represents a healthy and long-overdue recognition that the central bank may be digging itself into an ever-deeper hole by committing to misguided policies aimed at the wrong problem.
A comparable debate is raging over fiscal policy.
Can America finally face up to the perils of its strategy vacuum?

Libya’s Shadow on Sovereign Wealth Funds
NEW YORK – As Libya’s citizens rebuild their lives and economy, undoing the corruption in the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the sovereign wealth fund in which Muammar el-Qaddafi’s regime allegedly stashed and misused Libya’s oil wealth, is becoming a priority.
The National Transitional Council is debating who should take over Libya’s Central Bank and the LIA’s assets – an especially important decision, given that oil production is not expected to return to pre-war levels for several years.
Regardless of how the Libyan government eventually handles the LIA, all sovereign wealth funds – and their advisers and fundraisers – can learn several important lessons.
Of course, no one should infer from the Libyan case that other SWFs across the board are riddled with corruption and conflicts of interest.
The LIA has always been exceptional; indeed, several indices that rank SWFs on transparency, accountability, and governance issues have traditionally given only Iran a lower ranking.
Yet, while hard cases tend to make bad law and it is too early to judge, the LIA should be a wake-up call for corporations and funds both in the Middle East and around the globe.
First, governments should better clarify the sources of funding behind each particular investment.
Private funding that turns out to be public funding tied to the ruling family or government ministers presents different political and financial risks and should therefore be valued differently.
Second, the Libyan crisis has crystallized the problem of corporate shares owned by sovereign governments.
When the United States and the European Union decided to impose sanctions on the Libyan regime, including freezing shares owned by the LIA in European and American companies, many executives at these companies were surprised by how dramatically their firms were affected by the ownership structure.
Clearly, the liquidity of the shares and the perception of a lack of diligence on the part of corporate managers matters mightily.
Third, the LIA saga highlights SWFs’ potential cumulative effect on the stability of global markets.
All SWFs can respond to global political events by quickly withdrawing funds invested abroad.
As one of the WikiLeaks documents revealed, American diplomats lobbied the Libyan government during the financial crisis to keep funds in US banks, and to invest directly in a troubled US financial institution.
In this case, the Libyans did not respond by withdrawing a large amount of funds, but that could happen in the future.
Some argue that SWFs’ home governments and host countries have too many mutual interests – including the stability of the financial system and maintaining the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency – to threaten global markets.
That is true, on average and in normal times, but what happens if many SWFs, responding to sudden uncertainty and volatility, pull back at the same time for diplomatic or commercial reasons?
Individually rational behavior is often collectively suicidal.
Finally, the Libyan case and the Dubai debt crisis of 2009 might increase suspicion in the developed world and lead to protectionism against SWFs, especially those from North Africa and the Gulf.
The free flow of capital from these regions’ SWFs to corporations in the advanced countries is crucial in order to balance the global economy and provide liquidity to financial markets, especially given the prospect of another recession in the West.
Both home and host states will have to make sure that the current conflict over the LIA will not impede this important process.
But are we being fair by comparing the various regions’ SWFs and expecting them to adhere to Western standards?
The current efforts to restructure Libya’s Central Bank and LIA will affect markets’ perceptions of other sovereign players in the region.
Bahrain and Dubai come to mind.
Although recent reports of the International Working Group of sovereign funds have indicated the difficulties in applying uniform governance standards, several measures are needed in order to bring Libya back to global capital markets.
Despite the unique status of Libya’s economy and political system today, scrutinizing the process of investment in foreign companies, as well as defining the nature of the relationships between the Libyan regime and fund management, is necessary to ensure healthy commercial relations between sovereigns and their portfolio investments.
Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.
Both governments and corporations should internalize the message and learn from the Libyan example.
The alternative may be too expensive for shareholders and citizens alike.

A New Model for New Europe
WARSAW – Five years ago, Central and Eastern Europe was home to one of the world’s most impressive growth stories.
Annual GDP growth was close to 5%, just behind China and India.
Foreign direct investment poured into Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia at a rate of more than $40 billion per year.
One in six cars sold in greater Europe was being exported from factories in the region.
Productivity and per capita GDP were rising briskly, narrowing the gap with Western Europe.
But the region has struggled to regain momentum since the global financial crisis and subsequent recession.
Economic-growth rates have fallen to less than a third of their pre-crisis levels.
Foreign direct investment, which plunged 75% from 2008 to 2009, has only partly recovered.
Indeed, the region appears to have dropped off the radar of global businesses and investors.
Yet our new research finds that the attributes that had made the region so attractive remain intact.
Growth and FDI inflows are still depressed, but, overall, the region has weathered the crisis in relatively good shape.
In most countries, public debt as a share of GDP has not exceeded 60% since 2004 – in stark contrast to many of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union prior to that year.
And it remains the case that these countries collectively boast a highly educated labor force and wage levels that are 75% lower, on average, than in the EU-15 economies.
At the same time, the region shared in some of the same excesses – notably in the property market – that helped to bring about the crisis.
In Romania, real-estate prices rose 23% annually from 2004 to 2007.
And, despite substantial improvement in the business environment throughout the region, these economies rank behind their EU-15 neighbors on corruption (though they are doing better than other emerging economies, including China, India, Brazil, and Russia).
More important, the crisis exposed significant weaknesses in the region’s economic model: over-reliance on exports to Western Europe and a high level of consumption relative to other developing regions, fueled by borrowing and heavy reliance on FDI to fund capital investment.
But Central and Eastern Europe can fashion a new model that we believe would enable a return to GDP growth rates of 4-5%.
This model has three major components: expanding and upgrading exports; raising productivity in sectors where it is weak; and reviving FDI while developing ways for the region’s economies to fund more of their own growth through higher domestic saving.
The region has a major opportunity to raise the value of its exports of goods and services.
For example, it is well-positioned to become a regional food-processing hub for greater Europe and beyond.
The region’s wage rates are still sufficiently low that sausages made in Poland and sold in Berlin cost about 40% less than those made in Hamburg.
The region is already a net exporter of “knowledge-intensive” goods such as automobiles and aerospace products.
It could move into even more sophisticated areas with additional investment in education and further development of industry clusters such as Dolina Lotnicza (Aviation Valley) in southeastern Poland.
One promising opportunity lies in knowledge-intensive services.
Led by Poland, the region is an increasingly important location for outsourcing and offshoring work.
Its outsourcing industry is growing twice as fast as India’s.
But there could be even greater scope for growth, given two trends in Asia: rising wage costs and increasing concern among Western outsourcing customers about persistent cultural and language issues.
Central and Eastern Europe is well placed to benefit from these trends, given its strong language skills and cultural familiarity with European and North American clients.
The region is also many time zones closer to European and US clients than firms in Asia.
Several sectors are also ripe for productivity improvement.
In construction, which is a highly informal sector, productivity is 31% below EU-15 levels.
Productivity is also low in agriculture, owing to the predominance of small farms that are not highly mechanized.
Opening up the agricultural sector to foreign investment would help to scale up average farm sizes and introduce more modern methods.
“Network” industries, such as electric utilities and rail systems, have been partly privatized in most of the region.
Opening them more fully to competition and market incentives would help to raise productivity in these industries.
To reduce reliance on borrowing for consumption and the vagaries of FDI inflows, the region’s domestic saving rates must be raised once demand picks up.
Pension reform and further development of financial markets would help.
Implementing the components of this growth model for Central and Eastern Europe will require further reforms aimed at making it easier to do business and strengthening protections for investors.
The region’s economies should also invest significantly more in infrastructure and address the effects of aging, which could clip 0.7% from annual growth rates in the coming decade.
Getting more women into the work force would be one way to raise labor-force participation to EU-15 levels and avoid soaring dependency ratios.
Central and Eastern Europe will inevitably be in the global spotlight this year.
The 25th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain and the 10th anniversary of the accession to the EU of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia provide an opportunity for the region to showcase how far it has come in the last quarter-century.
But realizing the region’s considerable potential for further success will require a fresh approach to growth.

Europe Moves East
PARIS – Madrid and Warsaw recently looked very similar: both were the sites of massive demonstrations.
But the crowds gathered at Europe’s western and eastern extremities had very different agendas in mind.
In Spain, citizens were united by economic and social despair.
They took to the streets to express their rejection of a European Union-imposed austerity policy that they believe is leading them into an abyss.
They want jobs and the dignity and salaries that go with them.
The indignation of some had a clear anti-capitalist and anti-globalization tone.
In the Polish capital, Catholic and conservative parties, together with the “Solidarity” Trade Union, inspired by a reactionary Christian radio network, “Radio Maria,” gathered for political and cultural, rather than economic, reasons.
In the name of the defense of media freedom, they were denouncing a government that they found too “centrist” and insufficiently “Polish.”
Ten years ago, then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously distinguished between “Old” and “New” Europe on the basis of their attitudes toward the United States and the war in Iraq.
New Europe (at least its governments), understanding the need to exercise power, was from Mars, whereas Old Europe (with the main exception of Great Britain), having decayed into a culture of weakness, was from Venus.
The differences between the demonstrations in Madrid and Warsaw suggest that the distinction between Old and New Europe remains valid, though not in the way that Rumsfeld meant.
Of course, it would be inaccurate to oppose a thriving Poland to a collapsing Spain.
Given the overall European crisis, even Poland’s economy is no longer booming.
Unemployment is around 10% (still less than half the Spanish rate), and annual GDP growth is around 1% (Spain’s growth rate is negative).
But the moods in the two countries, as well as their perceptions of Europe and their role in it, contrast starkly.
Poland, which is not yet part of the eurozone, sees no alternative to the EU.
The country has fully reconciled itself with America’s strategic shift away from the European continent, even though Poles are as obsessively fearful of Russia as ever.
And can one blame them, given that Russia seems more nostalgic for its imperial tradition than ever?
But, given the political evolution of Ukraine, not to mention Belarus, Poland can no longer dream of an Eastern future.
Poland’s only way is West – but the European West more than the American one.
Poland is benefiting from economic growth and prosperity in Germany, its immediate western neighbor and closest ally.
Reconciliation between the two countries has been one of their greatest achievements, and Poland may, for the first time in its history, be in the right place – close to Berlin – at the right time.
By contrast, Spain seems to be moving south, figuratively if not literally (witness the desertification affecting some parts of Andalusia).
But Spain adamantly – and legitimately – refuses to be compared with Greece.
Consider its modern infrastructure, the dynamism of its young entrepreneurs, and the internationally recognized quality of its cultural goods. The Spaniards are right.
But Spain increasingly regards Europe more as a problem than as a solution.
It is not so much that its people want to leave the eurozone (or, for that matter, that many want their regions to leave Spain); rather, the country wants to remain itself – that is, to maintain a lifestyle that is largely the product of climate.
For Poles, the EU is still a tool for modernization, whereas Spaniards increasingly consider it synonymous with an attack on their dignity, if not on their essence.
How can one unite member countries with such different emotional calendars?
And how can Europe move ahead with such vivid pecking orders?
Spaniards are offended when they are compared to Greeks, Poles are shocked when they are compared with Spaniards, the French refuse to be compared to Italians, and so on, in an infernal spiral.
Yet not long ago – after the fall of Franco – Poles looked with envy at Spain.
Here I am reminded of a conversation with the Polish historian, statesman, and politician Bronisław Geremek in 1978, when we shared an office in Washington, DC.
For him, Poland and Spain had long had a somewhat parallel history.
Both were unable to integrate modernity into their institutions, and both had fallen into decline after a brilliant historical period between the late fifteenth and early eighteenth centuries.
Poland had even disappeared from the map of Europe – the victim of its immediate neighbors’ virulent greed.
Democracy returned to Spain in 1975, and the country soon recovered its place within Europe, just when Poland seemed trapped in its tragic history.
But, 11 years after my conversation with Geremek, communism collapsed in Poland, and in 2004 the country’s “return” to Europe was complete.
Today’s Poles do not believe that Europe has cheated them.
Nearly everywhere, you can see tangible signs of the EU’s support: a bridge here, a school there.
In Spain, by contrast, disillusion with the Union has replaced the early enthusiasm of the “movida” period.
Whether that remains true will most likely determine the future of Europe.

State of the Art, or Art of the State?
September is traditionally the time when opera companies and orchestras return to their home cities from Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood, and countless other summer festivals.
This rentrée is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of worries about how classical music is financed.
American symphonic life is Euro-centric in almost every respect except for its funding.
Whereas Americans depend upon tax-deductible private donations and box office receipts to finance live classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support for the arts.
Ironically, while arts advocates in the United States have long argued for adoption of the “European model” – which has produced a rich and varied artistic life for Europeans –Europe is being forced to change its system of support to one that depends more on private money and the box office.
Unfortunately, Europe’s system of direct government financial support is falling victim to Europe’s slow economic growth and budget deficits.
Particularly for those countries that have adopted the euro, government spending on the arts will be constrained for some time by the requirement that fiscal deficits be kept to 3% of GDP.
The resulting pressure on Europe’s performing arts institutions is causing concern at various different levels.
Traditionally, Europe’s social democracies have preferred allocating scarce goods and services like concerts and operas by queues (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by willingness to pay.
Now, this will change.
Performing arts advocates in Europe point to the US where, among other things, music directors of even major orchestras are now expected to fully participate in fundraising activities and be active in the local community on the orchestras behalf.
The same thing, they fear, will happen in Europe.
Some conductors, not wanting to carry a tin cup as they wave their batons, have rejected important posts in the US for this reason, feeling that it would interfere with their art. Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him.
But US experience shows that getting artistic leaders like orchestra music directors to participate in fundraising need not be bad for the artistic side of the job.
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined effective fundraising and artistic leadership to propel the San Francisco Symphony to the top rank of US orchestras.
It also should be reassuring to Europeans who are concerned that greater reliance on private money necessarily means conservative programming that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most adventuresome repertoires in the US.
If the audience has progressive tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible.
A corollary is that public money makes it possible for adventuresome programming even if audience tastes run to the conservative side.
This is one reason performing artists in Europe like public money – it liberates them from a diet of only Beethoven and Mozart.
Moreover, the audience may come to appreciate an adventuresome repertoire the more it becomes exposed to it.
Of course, with reduced public spending on the performing arts, not only will there be greater reliance on private money, but ticket prices will have to rise as well.
Some argue that this is a bad thing, because they prefer queuing to the price system and fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding young people.
But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth.
First, youth may not take advantage of cheap tickets to the extent that they are not interested in going to hear live classical music at any price.
Second, even if they do want to go, they may not be able to get seats, which often are not available because subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year.
What good are cheap prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there are no seats?
If a taste for classical music is to be subsidized, some more targeted subsidies should be preferred to cheap prices.
The best way to bring youth to the performing arts is through education.
Because American orchestras can’t count on schools or government to provide the basic music education necessary to ensure a continuing audience for classical music, some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money.
In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony runs a $23 million privately funded project – called Keeping Score – that includes a national public television series, radio shows, interactive music learning, and school music programs.
This type of innovative program is relevant for European as well as American orchestras.
The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.
So does poor music education in state schools.
If orchestras don’t look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after.

Emerging Economies’ Misinsurance Problem
LONDON – Over the last decade, America’s expansionary monetary policy and China’s rapid growth have been the two key drivers of global financial flows.
Now, both dynamics are being reversed, generating new risks for the global economy – particularly for emerging countries.
Whether they can cope with these changes will depend on whether they have taken out enough insurance against the right risks.
Following the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990’s, emerging economies began to accumulate massive foreign-exchange reserves to protect themselves against the risks of external over-indebtedness.
In fact, they amassed far more than they needed – $6.5 trillion, at last count – effectively becoming over-insured against external balance-of-payments shocks.
But they remained underinsured against domestic credit risks ­– the leading threat to emerging economies today.
After the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, interest rates plummeted, fueling private-sector credit booms in many of the largest emerging markets, including Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey.
Although these booms were initially financed by domestic capital, they soon became dependent on foreign capital, which flowed into their economies as advanced-country central banks pumped huge amounts of liquidity into financial markets.
Now, just as the US Federal Reserve contemplates an exit from its unconventional monetary policies, emerging economies’ current-account positions are weakening, making their reliance on capital inflows increasingly apparent – and increasingly dangerous.
Ironically, today’s pain stems from one of the great successes that emerging economies have achieved: the reduction of foreign-currency funding in favor of local-currency debt.
As emerging-market central banks leaned against heavy capital inflows in order to mitigate exchange-rate appreciation, their currencies became less volatile.
The resulting perception that currency risk was declining bolstered capital inflows further.
This virtuous feedback loop has now turned vicious, with capital inflows amounting to only a fraction of outflows.
Given this, the likely upshot of monetary tightening in the advanced economies will be a long depreciation of emerging-market currencies and, in turn, a significant interest-rate hike – a trend that puts emerging economies at risk for the kinds of credit crises that have bedeviled developed economies over the last six years.
The higher interest rates rise to stabilize emerging markets’ currencies, the more severe their crises will be.
Ultimately, even if emerging economies manage to diversify their funding away from foreign currencies, they will remain hostages to US monetary-policy cycles.
Had emerging economies resisted the temptation of excessive private-sector credit growth, raising interest rates in order to stabilize currencies would not pose a severe threat to economic performance.
But, unsurprisingly, they did not; rather, they succumbed to the notion that unprecedentedly high rates of GDP growth were the new normal.
Nowhere was this more apparent than in China, where double-digit annual output gains long obscured the flaws in a state-led, credit-fueled growth model that favors state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and selected industries, like the real-estate sector, to the detriment of private savers.
Since 2008, banking-sector credit growth in China has been among the fastest in the world, far outpacing GDP growth, and China’s total debt has risen from 130% of GDP to 220% of GDP.
As of this year, ¥1 of GDP growth is consistent with more than ¥3.5 of credit growth.
China’s financial sector is now increasingly feeling the strain of this rapid credit growth, which has led to overcapacity in favored sectors and mounting debt problems for local governments, SOEs, and banks.
Meanwhile, China’s shadow-banking system has expanded at an unprecedented rate.
But here, too, mounting risks have been largely ignored, owing partly to the collateralization of real property, which is believed to retain its value permanently, and partly to the system of implicit government guarantees that backs loans to local governments and SOEs.
At the very least, the combination of higher interest rates in the shadow-banking sector and weaker nominal GDP growth undermines borrowers’ debt-repayment capacity.
In a worst-case scenario, falling property prices or diminishing faith in implicit government guarantees would compound the risks generated by the shadow-banking system, severely undermining China’s financial stability.
In that sense, although China, with its $3.5 trillion stock of foreign-exchange reserves, may seem to exemplify emerging economies’ tendency to be over-insured against external risks, it actually faces the same credit risks as its counterparts.
The difference is that China has implemented structural – and thus longer-lasting – credit-based policies, while other emerging economies have been drawn into a cyclical lending binge.
Indeed, China’s slowness to implement an alternative to the investment-led, debt-financed growth model that has prevailed for the last two decades means that its domestic credit risks are the most significant threat to the global economy today.
While China may have the financial resources to cover its debt overhang, it risks being left with a low-to-middle-income economy, high debt levels, and nominal growth rates roughly two-thirds lower than the 17% average annual rate achieved in 2004-2011.
This is bad news for other emerging economies, which have depended heavily on China’s growth for their own.
Unless emerging-market governments take advantage of the limited space provided by their foreign-exchange reserves and floating currencies to enact vital structural reforms, the onus of adjustment will fall on interest rates, compounding the effects of slowing growth and the risks associated with bad debt.
Whether this becomes a systemic issue affecting the entire global economy will hinge on China.

Banking on African Infrastructure
JOHANNESBURG – As the US Federal Reserve embarks on the “great unwinding” of the stimulus program it began nearly a decade ago, emerging economies are growing anxious that a stronger dollar will adversely affect their ability to service dollar-denominated debt.
This is a particular concern for Africa, where, since the Seychelles issued its debut Eurobond in 2006, the total value of outstanding Eurobonds has grown to nearly $35 billion.
But if the Fed’s ongoing withdrawal of stimulus has frayed African nerves, it has also spurred recognition that there are smarter ways to finance development than borrowing in dollars.
Of the available options, one specific asset class stands out: infrastructure.
Africa, which by 2050 will be home to an estimated 2.6 billion people, is in dire need of funds to build and maintain roads, ports, power grids, and so on.
According to the World Bank, Africa must spend a staggering $93 billion annually to upgrade its current infrastructure; the vast majority of these funds – some 87% – are needed for improvements to basic services like energy, water, sanitation, and transportation.
Yet, if the recent past is any guide, the capital needed will be difficult to secure.
Between 2004 and 2013, African states closed just 158 financing deals for infrastructure or industrial projects, valued at $59 billion – just 5% of the total needed.
Given this track record, how will Africa fund even a fraction of the World Bank’s projected requirements?
The obvious source is institutional and foreign investment.
But, to date, many factors, including poor profit projections and political uncertainty, have limited such financing for infrastructure projects on the continent.
Investment in African infrastructure is perceived as simply being too risky.
Fortunately, with work, this perception can be overcome, as some investors – such as the African Development Bank, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and the Trade & Development Bank – have already demonstrated.
Companies from the private sector are also profitably financing projects on the continent.
For example, Black Rhino, a fund set up by Blackstone, one of the world’s largest multinational private equity firms, focuses on the development and acquisition of energy projects, such as fuel storage, pipelines, and transmission networks.
But these are the exceptions, not the rule.
Fully funding Africa’s infrastructure shortfall will require attracting many more investors – and swiftly.
To succeed, Africa must develop a more coherent and coordinated approach to courting capital, while at the same time working to mitigate investors’ risk exposure.
Public-private sector collaborations are one possibility.
For example, in the energy sector, independent power producers are working with governments to provide electricity to 620 million Africans living off the grid.
Privately funded but government regulated, these producers operate through power purchase agreements, whereby public utilities and regulators agree to purchase electricity at a predetermined price.
There are approximately 130 such producers in Sub-Saharan Africa, valued at more than $8 billion.
In South Africa alone, 47 projects are underway, accounting for 7,000 megawatts of additional power production.
Similar private-public partnerships are emerging in other sectors, too, such as transportation.
Among the most promising are toll roads built with private money, a model that began in South Africa.
Not only are these projects, which are slowly appearing elsewhere on the continent, more profitable than most financial market investments; they are also literally paving the way for future growth.
Clearly, Africa needs more of these ventures to overcome its infrastructure challenges.
That is why I, along with other African business leaders and policymakers, have called on Africa’s institutional investors to commit 5% of their funds to local infrastructure.
We believe that with the right incentives, infrastructure can be an innovative and attractive asset class for those with long-term liabilities.
One sector that could lead the way on this commitment is the continent’s pension funds, which, together, possess a balance sheet of about $3 trillion.
The 5% Agenda campaign, launched in New York last month, underscores the belief that only a collaborative public-private approach can redress Africa’s infrastructure shortfall.
For years, a lack of bankable projects deterred international financing.
But in 2012, the African Union adopted the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa, which kick-started more than 400 energy, transportation, water, and communications projects.
It was a solid start – one that the 5% Agenda seeks to build upon.
But some key reforms will be needed.
A high priority of the 5% Agenda is to assist in updating the national and regional regulatory frameworks that guide institutional investment in Africa.
Similarly, new financial products must be developed to give asset owners the ability to allocate capital directly to infrastructure projects.
Unlocking new pools of capital will help create jobs, encourage regional integration, and ensure that Africa has the facilities to accommodate the needs of future generations.
But all of this depends on persuading investors to put their money into African projects.
As business leaders and policymakers, we must ensure that the conditions for profitability and social impact are not mutually exclusive.
When development goals and profits align, everyone wins.

General Marshall on the Aegean
BERKELEY – It should now be clear to even the most blinkered observer that the Greek economy is in desperate need of help.
Unemployment is 16% and rising.
Even after a year of excruciating spending cuts, the budget deficit still exceeds 10% of GDP.
Residents don’t pay taxes.
The system of property registration is a mess.
There is little confidence in the banks, and even less in the government and its policies.
Since the economy needs help, here’s a novel idea: provide some.
Now is the time for the European Union to come forward with a Marshall Plan for Greece.
Rather than piling more loans onto the country’s already unsustainable debt burden, the EU should offer a multi-year program of foreign aid.
The Greek government and donors would decide together the projects that it financed.
These could range from building new solar and wind power-generating facilities, in order to turn Greece into a major energy exporter, to updating its ports to help make it a commercial hub for the eastern Mediterranean.
Foreign aid and expertise could be used to modernize the property-registration and tax-collection systems.
Funds could be used for recapitalizing the banks and retiring some debt.
They could help finance government support for the unemployed, indigent, and elderly, who are among the principal victims of the financial crisis.
The EU should contemplate this option, because, for starters, it bears more than a little responsibility for Greece’s plight.
It offered membership to a country with deep structural problems.
It then accepted Greece into its monetary union with full knowledge that its fiscal accounts were not worth the paper they were written on.
And it looked the other way when French and German banks recklessly enabled the Greek government’s profligacy.
Second, the current strategy, which amounts to trying to extract blood from a stone, is not working.
There are limits to how quickly a country can reform.
A society can bear only so much pain and suffering before it loses faith in its political system.
EU leaders need to acknowledge this reality before it’s too late.
And, finally, history suggests that a Marshall Plan for Greece might actually work.
Recall the plight of the European countries that received aid from the United States after World War II.
They had massive debts.
Their budgets were deep in deficit.
They exported little.
Property rights were uncertain.
Support for governments grappling with these problems was extremely fragile.
The Marshall Plan, by financing strategic investments, helped the recipients to ramp up their exports.
Aid-financed reconstruction turned Rotterdam into a commercial hub for Northern Europe.
US aid underwrote the imports of coal and investments in hydroelectric power needed to get industry running again.
And, in some cases, like France, US funds were used to extinguish part of the public debt.
Importantly, these projects were neither dictated by the donor nor chosen by the recipient, but decided in collaboration.
The recipient, moreover, had to put up matching (“counterpart”) funds for each and every project.
A further condition for receiving aid was that the government had to follow through with macroeconomic stabilization.
But this was now politically feasible, because aid topped up the public coffers, reducing the depth of the necessary cuts and the associated pain and suffering.
Support for the centrist governments undertaking these reforms was correspondingly stronger.
Indeed, solidifying political support for policies of stabilization and reform was probably the Marshall Plan’s single most important contribution.
With that support in place, the recipient countries could do the rest.
Europe could get back on its feet.
The cynics among us – that is to say, economists – will worry about the precedent set by a Marshall Plan for Greece.
They will warn that other EU countries like Portugal will refuse to undertake more reform, retrenchment, and repayment unless they receive similar largesse.
Economists are trained to worry about this problem, known as moral hazard.
But the kind of social chaos and international disrepute that Greece has suffered are a considerable disincentive to go down this path. And while there is moral-hazard risk, there is also meltdown risk.
There is the danger of a complete economic, social, and political meltdown in Greece.
If that meltdown is not averted, it could take down the rest of Europe.
A Marshall Plan for Greece would require European leaders to do the unprecedented: they would have to lead.
That, of course, is what the US did after World War II with the Marshall Plan.
Europeans might usefully look back 60 years, to a time when their own countries, perched on the brink of a similar collapse, received the help that they needed to recover – help that has put them in a position to do something similar for Greece today.

Fulfilling the Genomic Promise
VIENNA – For most people, a promise is a reason to expect something, a well-founded hope without hype.
And it is a promise in this sense that connects science to society: the public trusts that scientific and technological advancement are the keys to navigating the uncertain road to a better world, in which future generations can live longer, healthier, and happier lives.
This promise originated almost 400 years ago, with the institutionalization of modern science.
After discovering that mathematics could be applied to understanding the physical world, a small group of natural philosophers turned toward experimental empiricism with practical objectives.
Spearheaded by this minority, the scientific revolution swept through Europe and, later, spread to the rest of the world.
In his Instauratio Magna, Francis Bacon, one of modern science’s most articulate proponents, conveyed a vision of a new world, transformed through the systematic inquiry of natural phenomena.
By imitating and twisting nature, he declared, its secrets would be revealed – and could be manipulated to improve humans’ lives.
Bacon’s pragmatic objective of using a scientific understanding of natural causes to “effect all things possible” – what is now called innovation – was science’s original promise to society, and formed the core of the Age of Enlightenment.
While many of science’s promises have been fulfilled – notably, the dramatic extension of the human lifespan and of leisure time – many others have been only partly achieved, or not at all.
And yet society’s trust in science has not wavered.
While specific objectives have changed, the overarching belief that scientific knowledge transforms people’s lives – as cultural, educational, and institutional factors converge with technological and industrial dynamics – has remained strong.
Today, genetics is the leading source of scientific promise.
Since James D. Watson and Francis Crick uncovered DNA’s structure in 1953, a massive amount of available genetic data has been identified, and novel forms of scientific organization and modes of working have emerged.
As a result, genetics has brought science to the brink of a new era of enlightenment, in which individuals are understood in terms of the relationships among their unique genomic data.
This movement – the latest incarnation of the endless quest for human advancement – poses new challenges to the relationship between science and society.
As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition: “The genomic revolution is here – are you ready?”
For example, this revolution will undoubtedly lead to the engineering of life through synthetic biology, a prospect that remains controversial.
Likewise, epigenetics (the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without altering the DNA sequence) has reshaped the old nature-versus-nurture debate by highlighting the multi-dimensional character of the relationship between biological and social development.
The growing understanding of transgenerational epigenetic modifications, whether nutritional or neurological, has opened new perspectives on the plasticity of the phenotype (an organism’s observable characteristics), and the factors that might affect it.
As a result, it is now clear that people’s lifestyles do not concern only themselves.
These developments – and the questions that they raise – underscore the need to redraw the map of the sciences.
A more integrated research agenda that includes the social sciences is crucial to ensuring that the promise of genetic research benefits all.
In fact, such research is integral to improving upon the factors that contribute most to a society’s wealth: health, education, and ethics.
Indeed, more encompassing knowledge of personal genomics can engender a new sense of commonality.
With a better understanding of people’s relationships to each other – from the impact that one’s lifestyle could have on the health of future generations to the corrosive effects of existing inequalities and the concomitant risk of a new genetic divide – a healthier, more equal society could be created.
But realizing this vision requires accounting for the different choices that people make within a pluralistic society.
To this end, the collaboration of social and scientific institutions would help to break down language and cultural barriers, ensuring that the genomic revolution aids, rather than alienates, the public, and thereby passes the true test of any scientific advancement: relevance to everyday experience.
In a world characterized by multiple, overlapping crises, people need to see, understand, and identify with what genetics has to offer.
When asked what should keep us awake at night, the economist Amartya Sen answered, “The tragedies that we can prevent, the injustice that we can repair.” Applying scientific advances to the prevention of tragedy and the redress of injustice fulfills science’s core promise.
Strengthening the real-world role of genetics is an essential step in that direction.

Barroso Overboard?
BRUSSELS – It is time for José Manuel Barroso to start selling himself.
His chances of being re-appointed as President of the European Commission depend on the case he makes.
Until the global financial crisis broke, Barroso looked fairly certain to get a second five-year term.
Now, it is becoming increasingly hard to find diplomats or policymakers who support him.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is said to have been disappointed by Barroso’s performance during last autumn's financial meltdown, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also seems to have fallen silent on the matter of his future.
No one doubts that Barroso is in an awkward position.
The European Commission has few powers of its own with which to confront the recession as it spreads throughout the European Union; most powers belong to the European Central Bank.
But the Commission does have a voice with which to rally people, and it is for their silence that Barroso and his fellow commissioners are being rebuked.
The perceived lack of leadership from the Commission at this time of deepening economic gloom is just the tip of the iceberg.
The events of recent months have crystallized more deep-seated concerns.
When Barroso, the former Portuguese prime minister, was awarded the EU post by his fellow heads of government, he appeared to be a dynamic new broom who would sweep away the cobwebs left by his predecessor, Italy’s Romano Prodi.
But, with the passage of time, the Barroso-led Commission has also come under fire for being unadventurous and lacklustre.
Even before the clouds of recession began to gather, Euroskepticism was on the rise, with the Commission blamed, rightly or wrongly, for the EU’s failure “to reach out to the citizen.”
The job of Commission President is arguably among the most difficult in the world.
The institution has been in near-imperceptible decline for almost 20 years, thanks to the rise of the European Parliament and the way EU member governments have whittled away its authority while consolidating their own powers as the EU’s true legislators.
Yet the head of the Commission is called upon to be the dynamic public face of Europe.
The Commission’s own internal culture of cautiousness and red tape is a constraint that nobody in Brussels much likes to talk about.
It is not a structure that is conducive to political coups de theâtre , and most of the Commission’s work is the relentless grind of EU regulation and re-regulation.
But the bottom line is that at a time when everyone is asking, “What is Europe doing?”, the Commission’s responses have seemed inadequate.
For reasons that are now obscure, there is an unwritten rule that Commission presidents must be drawn from the ranks of past or current prime ministers.
This has in large part accounted for Barroso’s high hopes of getting a second term.
There was, it appeared, no other credible candidate to challenge him.
For his part, Barroso is widely seen as having avoided controversy throughout 2008 in order not to risk offending any governments that might have been inclined to block his reappointment.
That seeming passivity is now his greatest problem.
France’s presidency of the EU during the second half of 2008 showed that dynamic leadership is a quality widely appreciated by the European public.
With his sense of showmanship, Sarkozy almost effortlessly eclipsed Barroso when handling the Russia-Georgia crisis in August, followed by the EU’s responses to the autumn crisis of cascading bank collapses.
The Commission was left on the sidelines.
What is to be done?
France’s successful presidency has intensified doubts about the effectiveness of the Commission and its president, so much so that even in Paris concerns are being voiced that the Brussels executive must somehow be strengthened if it is not to become a mere secretariat.
EU governments have wanted a pliable Commission, but now the cost could be the death of the “community method” that protects the EU against national frictions.
Barroso needs to respond to all these doubts.
If he is to reassure EU national leaders that they should re-appoint him, then he needs to signal that his second term can hold out fresh promise.
He is good at giving upbeat speeches, but this will not be enough.
Some sort of plan is needed.
When he arrived in Brussels in 2004, Barroso was repeatedly asked whether he had a “big idea” for Europe’s future.
Back then, he did not need one to be appointed. This time, he must produce one if he is to save his skin.

The Geopolitical Conquest of Economics
PARIS – From the Huawei affair to the AUKUS spat and beyond, a new reality is shaking up the global economy: the takeover, usually hostile, of international economics by geopolitics.
This process is probably only just beginning, and the challenge now is learning how to live with it.
Of course, economics and geopolitics have never been completely separate domains.
The post-World War II liberal economic order was designed by economists, but on the basis of a master plan conceived by foreign-policy strategists.
Postwar US policymakers knew what they wanted: what a 1950 National Security Council report called a “world environment in which the American system can survive and flourish.”
From their perspective, the free world’s prosperity was the (ultimately successful) conduit to containing and possibly defeating Soviet communism, and the liberal order was the conduit to that prosperity.
But although the ultimate objective was geopolitical, international economic relations were shaped for 70 years by their own rules.
On occasion, concrete decisions were skewed by geopolitics: for the United States, providing International Monetary Fund financial assistance to Mexico was never equivalent to providing it to Indonesia.
The principles governing trade or exchange-rate policy, however, were strictly economic.
The end of the Cold War temporarily put economists on top.
For three decades afterward, finance ministers and central bankers thought they were running the world.
As Jake Sullivan (now the national security adviser to US President Joe Biden) and Jennifer Harris pointed out in 2020, management of globalization had been deferred to “a small community of experts.”
Again, there was an underlying geopolitical aim: in the same way that economic openness had contributed to the Soviet Union’s collapse, it was expected to bring about China’s convergence toward the Western model.
But for the rest, interference remained limited.
The rise of China and its growing rivalry with the US brought this era to an end.
With the failure of convergence through economic integration, geopolitics has returned to the fore.
Biden’s focus on the Chinese challenge and his decision not to dismantle the trade restrictions put in place by his predecessor, Donald Trump, confirm that the US has entered a new era in which foreign policy has taken over from economics.
In China, there was no need for such a takeover.
Although the country’s leaders routinely pay lip service to multilateralism, both its historical tradition and governance philosophy emphasize political control of domestic and especially foreign economic relations.
The transnational Belt and Road Initiative embodies this model: as Georgetown University’s Anna Gelpern and co-authors recently documented, Chinese loan contracts to finance infrastructure projects in developing countries are opaque, involve political conditionality, and explicitly rule out debt restructuring through multilateral procedures.
Even in Europe, where belief in the primacy of economics was most entrenched, things have begun to change.
“The beating heart of the globalist project is in Brussels,” US populist agitateur Steve Bannon declared contemptuously in 2018.
This was in fact true: the primacy of common rules over state discretion is part of Europe’s DNA.
But the European Union, too, is now waking up to the new reality.
Already in 2019, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of leading a “geopolitical commission.”
The question is what this renewed geopolitical focus actually implies.
Most foreign-policy experts envision international relations as a power game.
Their implicit models often assume that one country’s gain is another’s loss.
Economists, on the other hand, are more interested in promoting the gains that cross-border transactions or joint action yield to all parties.
Their benchmark concept of international economic relations envisions independent actors voluntarily entering into mutually beneficial arrangements.
In a 2019 article, Sullivan and Kurt Campbell (who now directs Asia policy at Biden’s National Security Council) outlined a plan for “competition without catastrophe” between the US and China.
Their scheme combined across-the-board trade reciprocity with China, the formation of a club of deeply integrated market democracies (access to which would be conditional on economic alignment), and a policy sequencing in which competition with China would be the default option, with cooperation conditional on China’s good behavior.
They also rejected any linkage between US concessions and cooperation in the management of global commons such as climate.
This would be a clear strategy, but the Biden administration has not yet indicated whether it intends to pursue it.
US middle-class economic woes and the resulting enduring domestic reluctance to open up trade contradict geopolitical aims and make America’s intentions hard to read.
Foreign-policy types may have prevailed over economists, but domestic politics reigns supreme, and clear-mindedness is not what is guiding action.
China, meanwhile, has flatly refused to carve out climate cooperation from the wider US-Chinese discussion, and recently wrong-footed the US by applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade pact that President Barack Obama designed to isolate China but that Trump chose to quit.
Instead of being isolated, China is trying to outmaneuver the US.
Paradoxically, Europe is getting closer to defining its stance.
It still believes in global rules, and gives priority to persuading partners to negotiate and enforce them, but it stands ready to act on its own.
“Open strategic autonomy” – its new buzzword – seemed to be an oxymoron.
But the EU now seems to know what it means: in the words of senior EU trade official Sabine Weyand, “work with others wherever we can, and work autonomously wherever we must.”
In a more geopolitical world, this may well become Europe’s credo.

Will We Save the International Financial System?
The World Bank and IMF have completed their annual meetings, which were greeted by street demonstrations and a paucity of innovative ideas.
Here George Soros suggests a bold new tack to restructure the world's financial system.
The international financial system is broken down in the sense that it fails to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and qualify for it.
Global financial markets suck most of the world's savings to the center, but they fail to pump money back out to the periphery.
Indeed, since 1997, there has been a reverse flow of capital from countries on the poor periphery of the world economy to those in the wealthy center.
The facts speak for themselves.
America runs a chronic current account deficit approaching an astonishing 5% of GDP; $242 billion in the first half of this year.
At the same time, Brazil - which has followed sound economic policies and has healthy budget and trade surpluses - cannot refinance its debt at acceptable rates.
The prevailing belief that market discipline corrects such imbalances is false, for two reasons.
First, financial markets are inherently unstable.
Second, the international financial system is biased in favor of the wealthy center.
Instability arises because financial markets try to discount a future that depends on their own behavior.
It is now recognized that this can lead to what economists call "multiple equilibria," but we continue to deny the clear implication that financial markets cannot be left to their own devices.
In practice, of course, international financial markets never have been left to their own devices.
Rich countries, led by the US, are in charge.
Their primary task is protecting their own interests.
When these countries get into trouble, their authorities intervene forcefully.
Countries that cannot borrow in international markets in their own currency lack that power.
They must turn to the IMF, and the IMF is more concerned with international financial stability than with enabling developing countries to pursue the countercyclical policies needed to avoid recession.
Until recently, IMF rescue programs were designed to enable debtor countries to meet their obligations.
Taxpayers in debtor countries, such as Mexico, picked up the tab.
This may have been unfair, but at least it kept money flowing to the periphery.
The emerging market crisis of 1997-1998 changed all this.
That crisis was attributed not to instability in the financial markets and the lopsidedness of the system, but to the "moral hazard" introduced by IMF bail-outs.
This lead to a U-turn: from bail-outs to "bail-ins," and to private sector burden sharing.
Moral hazard has been curtailed but the risks of investing in emerging markets increased.
Those risks are now reflected in market prices, which is the source of today's problem.
What can prevent the situation from deteriorating further and perhaps culminating in a systemic crisis?
In the broadest terms, we must create a more level playing field.
There is nothing wrong with imposing market discipline on countries that follow unsound policies, but the risk-reward ratio for lending and investing has shifted too far against the periphery.
Countries that qualify ought to have access to a lender of last resort and be empowered to pursue countercyclical policies.
Brazil, for example, confronts an unambiguous case of market failure.
Although the maximum sustainable real interest rate is about 10%, Brazil's dollar-denominated debt yields 24.5%.
A one-year Real note pays 27%.
At these rates, Brazil is heading for bankruptcy.
If no lender of last resort ensures that credit is available at or below 10%, Brazil cannot be expected to meet its obligations - dealing a terrible blow both to Brazil and the international financial system.
Where there is a political will, there is a way.
For instance, the central banks of the US, Europe, Japan, and Britain could accept Brazilian paper at their discount windows.
The IMF could guarantee the central banks against market risk at current prices.
This would provide a tremendous boost to the market and drastically reduce interest rates.
Naturally, all guarantees would be conditional on Brazil abiding by the IMF agreement.
If successful, the IMF guarantee would never be invoked.
What I propose is novel: it would leverage the IMF's $30 billion loan to Brazil tenfold (and set a useful precedent).
Unfortunately, such a scheme exceeds the imagination and political will of the IMF's shareholders.
But let's be clear: failure to address the problem could have disastrous consequences.
After all, how would a Brazilian default affect Mexico?
Addressing the broader, system-wide problem, we must find ways to stimulate domestic-led growth in the periphery countries.
Countries that follow sound macroeconomic policies do not derive sufficient economic benefits from doing so.
This generates political discontent that could have adverse consequences beyond the economic sphere.
At present, the US serves as the motor of the global economy.
But a chronic current account deficit is unsound, unfair, and unsustainable in the long run.
More urgently, the US motor is sputtering.
It would be benefit all parties to start another motor.
To this end, I proposed an annual issue of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) that rich countries would donate for international assistance.
This is a proposal whose time has come because the world economy is hovering on the brink of deflation.
Until recently, globalization unfolded against the background of a global boom; now we are experiencing a global bear market.
I am afraid globalization may not survive unless we find new ways to stimulate the global economy.
The SDR donation scheme would activate resources that are currently idle, benefiting donors and recipients.
It would also reduce the increasing inequality between rich and poor countries.

The Politics of Polio Eradication
CAMBRIDGE – A few years ago, the global campaign to eradicate polio seemed to have stalled.
After decades of eradication efforts, the virus remained stubbornly endemic in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.
Then, in 2013 and 2014, it was found to have returned to seven previously polio-free countries in Africa and the Middle East, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the disease’s resurgence a “public-health emergency of international concern.”
Despite this recidivism, the world today is closer than ever to eradicating polio.
In 2015, there were just 74 new cases of the disease – 80% fewer than the previous year and the lowest annual total ever.
And all of the cases were concentrated in just two countries, 54 in Pakistan and 20 in Afghanistan.
Moreover, it has been eighteen months since the virus was last detected in Africa.
The reasons behind this remarkable turnaround are instructive, illustrating the challenges facing public-health workers and the best ways to overcome them.
The barriers to polio eradication are no longer medical; the disease does not occur where vaccination programs operate unhindered.
During the past five years, polio cases have occurred almost exclusively in five conflict-affected countries: Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Syria.
Because immunization programs are led by national governments and the WHO, which, as a specialized agency of the United Nations, works closely with incumbent regimes, it can be difficult to carry out vaccinations in areas where militants wage war against the state.
The fall in the number of polio cases largely resulted from improved access to such areas.
In Nigeria and Pakistan, vaccination programs were able to proceed after troops asserted the state’s control over conflict-affected territory.
Most polio cases occurred in northern and eastern Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram had killed and kidnapped immunization workers, disrupting vaccination programs and leaving more than a million children unprotected.
After a regional military force pushed the group into sparsely populated mountains and forests, immunization workers were provided access to previously rebel-controlled areas.
In Pakistan, polio is concentrated in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the northwest of the country, where the Taliban are strongest.
In 2012, militant leaders in the region banned immunization programs over concerns that they were being used to gather intelligence for drone attacks by the United States.
Consequently 1-3.5 million Pakistani children were not vaccinated.
That changed in the summer of 2014, when the Pakistan military brought large areas of the region under government control.
In the space of a single year, the number of polio cases fell from 306 to 54.
Using troops to assert control over conflict-affected areas is not the only way to improve access for polio workers, and in some cases it may not be the most effective.
In Afghanistan, Somalia, and Syria, the government was either unable or unwilling to assert authority over rebel-controlled territory.
Instead, immunization workers adapted to the political reality and worked with militants to gain access to areas under their control.
The Afghan Taliban have cooperated with polio vaccination programs since the 1990s.
In most cases, local-level leaders have welcomed immunization workers, seeing vaccination programs as a form of patronage that reinforces their authority.
The few polio cases that have been detected have been either cross-border transmissions from Pakistan or have occurred in areas where intense conflict between the Taliban and the Afghan government has temporarily disrupted polio campaigns.
By contrast, in Somalia, the terrorist group al-Shabaab has historically forbidden polio workers from operating in areas under their control, viewing vaccination campaigns as part of a foreign campaign to impose a centralized government.
One million children were unvaccinated between 2010 and 2013, when a polio outbreak occurred.
Since then, immunization campaigns have improved their access to rebel-controlled areas by employing locally recruited staff to work within their own clans and negotiate access with local-level militant leaders.
In Syria, after the start of the uprising in 2011, the government prevented the WHO from operating in areas outside its control.
Over three million children were not vaccinated for polio, leading to an outbreak in rebel-controlled regions in 2013.
In response, an ad hoc coalition, including moderate opposition groups, Turkish authorities, and local NGOs carried out a series of vaccination campaigns and contained the outbreak.
The coalition negotiated access with local rebel leaders, allowing them to choose volunteer vaccinators.
Militant groups – even the so-called Islamic State – permitted immunization campaigns to operate in areas under their control.
The lesson is clear.
Successful immunization campaigns must secure the support of de facto political leaders – whether of an internationally recognized state or of a vilified militant organization.
As objectionable as working with groups like the Islamic State might be, it is important to remember that the main objective of efforts like the campaign to eradicate polio is to improve the health of people wherever they may live.

Waking from the Middle East Nightmare
MADRID – The Middle East is caught in a seemingly endless spiral of instability.
The possibility of military intervention in Syria, together with the deteriorating situation in Egypt since the army’s coup, has placed the region on a razor’s edge.
Moreover, despite the changes in Iran since its presidential election in June, international negotiations over its nuclear ambitions remain a dead letter.
Paradoxes abound, as the United States’s traditional Middle East allies (Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, and the Gulf states) have taken opposing – and sometimes seemingly contradictory – positions on the region’s key conflicts.
And, in all of today’s hotspots, the assertion of interests by neighboring or nearby countries has complicated matters further.
Saudi Arabia, fearing severe domestic consequences from the Muslim Brotherhood’s empowerment in Egypt, does not want to see an Islamist movement legitimized democratically.
So it has taken a consistently harsh position against the Brotherhood, despite the latter being more moderate than the Saudis’ own brand of Islam.
Israel, for its part, is exerting pressure in two ways.
First, it is supporting the Egyptian coup and international recognition of the military regime, thereby ensuring – it hopes – greater stability along the Sinai border.
Second, it is making progress in its negotiations with the Palestinians dependent on events in Egypt and elsewhere in the region, such as Iran.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has invested considerable political capital in the revival of peace negotiations, and Israel can use that to its advantage as well.
The civil war in Syria, meanwhile, has inflamed the Sunni-Shia fault line that traverses the entire region, and that defines, for example, the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
In fact, while Saudi Arabia opposes elected Islamists in Egypt, it supports insurgent Islamists in Syria, owing entirely to Iran’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
The Egyptian coup has already proved to have been a mistake.
The military seems to be reverting to the governing methods – and even the feared security institutions – of former President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule. Even Mubarak himself has now been released from prison.
The army’s repression of the Muslim Brotherhood is more a question of competition for power than of religion.
As the only organized force in the country that could seriously challenge the military, the Brotherhood is the greatest threat that the Army faces, as demonstrated by Mohamed Morsi’s victory in the election that made him president a year before he was overthrown.
And, on top of it all, the problem posed by Iran’s nuclear program remains unresolved.
That may not be surprising, given the violence and turmoil elsewhere in the region.
But, since Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, took office at the beginning of August, the West, to put it bluntly, has not demonstrated sufficient will to explore possible openings.
That is a grave mistake, because progress in the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would create a more propitious climate for resolving the region’s other problems.
Moreover, the negotiations will now be under the jurisdiction of Iran’s presidential administration, which gives Rouhani greater room for maneuver.
The new foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, is well known and respected by the leaders of all of the countries participating in the negotiations, and he will assume important responsibilities in any talks that take place.
While caution is certainly in order, the importance of Rouhani’s election must be recognized.
If a window of opportunity has opened, the West should do everything possible to take advantage of it.
Rouhani, it should be remembered, won a surprising victory in an election with roughly 75% voter turnout, despite expectations of widespread apathy.
Rouhani mobilized Iranians by offering a clear program for economic renewal, which hinges on Iran’s engagement with the international community – and thus on progress in nuclear negotiations.
Since taking office, Rouhani has responded quickly to the Iranian public’s demands.
His cabinet, in terms of its members’ positions on economic reform and international relations, is one that few observers believed he would be capable of assembling.
Thus, two important steps have been taken: one by the people of Iran, who have shown that they understand the challenges they face, and the other by their new president, who has assembled the best team available to undertake an enormously difficult program.
There is an expression in Iran that applies to the international community: “You can wake only someone who is sleeping, not someone who is pretending to be asleep.”
Whether Iran’s international interlocutors act on the importance of Rouhani’s election is a matter of choice, not of ignorance.
In a Middle East so full of uncertainty, a more predictable Iran – one that behaves like a regionally important state, not a destabilizing Shia movement whose ambitions exceed what international law permits – would be in everyone’s interest.
There can be no path from the Middle East’s agony without the participation, commitment, and determination of all parties.

What’s Hollowing Out the US Workforce?
WASHNGTON, DC – America’s labor market is booming.
Over the past six months, the economy added an average of 465,000 net jobs per month – recovering all the jobs lost during the pandemic, as of July – and the unemployment rate fell by three-tenths of a percentage point.
At 3.5%, it is as low as it was in the tight labor market of early 2020.
Unfortunately, the workforce participation rate tells a different story.
At 62.1%, it is 1.3 percentage points below its level in February 2020, the month before the pandemic began pummeling the US economy.
Although the labor-force participation rate has recovered nearly two percentage points from its low in April 2020, it has been stagnant over the course of this year.
True, much of the decline is being driven by relatively older workers.
Early retirements and the aging of the population have reduced the workforce participation rate for people over 55 to 38.7% –1.6 percentage points lower than its February 2020 level.
Worse, economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that population aging could continue to reduce the participation rate by 0.2 percentage points per year.
But unfavorable demographics do not explain the entire drop.
People in their early twenties are 3% less likely to be in the workforce now than they were when the pandemic began.
And for people in their “prime working years” – ages 25 to 54, when they are generally too old to be in school but too young to be retired – the rate is 0.7 percentage points lower than it was in February 2020.
Moreover, merely returning to pre-pandemic workforce participation rates sets the bar for success too low.
Prior to the pandemic, average wages were growing at around 3% per year; but they have recently been growing substantially faster, at an annualized rate of around 5%.
And in sectors such as leisure and hospitality, transportation and warehousing, and education and health services, the underlying rate of wage growth has tripled.
Higher and faster-growing wages should make employment more attractive, so it is reasonable to expect workforce participation rates – particularly for prime-age workers – to be higher than they were before the pandemic.
So, why aren’t they?
The pandemic could still be part of the reason.
According to my calculations using data from the US Census Bureau, 7.3 million people say they are not working because they are caring for someone with COVID-19 symptoms; concerned about getting the disease; or laid off, furloughed, or subject to temporary workplace closures due to COVID-19.
Moreover, owing to various stimulus laws passed earlier in the pandemic, US households still have more than $2 trillion in excess savings on their balance sheets, which could be keeping some people on the sidelines.
And because some childcare centers still have rather draconian rules that require children to quarantine after any COVID-19 exposure, some parents may be unable to get back to work.
But as the months continue to tick off the calendar, these explanations are becoming less persuasive, and the post-pandemic decline in workforce participation is starting to look more like part of a longer-term trend toward joblessness.
In July 1952, around 97% of men between the ages of 25 and 54 were participating in the US workforce.
Last month, that share had fallen to around 88%.
The drop has been steady over time, with the participation rate recovering somewhat during expansions, but seldom returning to its previous peak.
Over most of this period, prime-age women have been increasing their participation in the workforce, which peaked at 77.3% in 2000 before falling back to 76.4% last month. This aligns with the trend for the overall participation rate, which peaked in the late 1990s and now sits more than two percentage points below its high mark.
For my part, I had expected both headline employment and prime-age participation to recover fully from the pandemic.
But if the participation rate doesn’t fully recover, this will indicate that the constellation of forces that has been pushing it down over the past several decades is even more powerful than I had previously thought.
The long-term increase in joblessness is one of the most important economic and social challenges facing the United States.
Joblessness represents a serious potential headwind for economic growth and is well-known to be associated with higher rates of crime and other social ills.
For many, paid employment is a source of dignity and fulfillment – a way to contribute to society and to earn success.
Ever-lower rates of workforce participation are a slow-burning catastrophe.
Whether or not the share of adults participating in the workforce fully recovers from the pandemic, reversing the longer-term decline should be a top priority for policymakers in both political parties.
So far, it hasn’t been.
But with Republicans’ newfound rhetorical commitment to being a “working-class party,” and with much of President Joe Biden’s social-policy agenda still on the shelf, the table at least is set for this issue to be considered.
Will policymakers rise to the challenge?
I wouldn’t bet on it.
But for the sake of the country’s long-term economic outlook – and of the millions of additional Americans who could be contributing their talents and efforts through paid employment – I hope to be surprised.

The Re-Birth of Japanese Democracy
NEW YORK – Moods and fashions in Japan often arrive like tsunamis, typhoons, or landslides.
After more than 50 years of almost uninterrupted power, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been buried in a general election.
Once before, in 1993, change came when a coalition of opposition parties briefly took power, but the LDP still held on to a majority in the Diet’s powerful lower house.
This time, even that last bastion has fallen.
The center-left Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took more than 300 of 480 seats in the lower house.
The LDP rules no more.
The world, fixated on China’s rise, was slow to pay attention to this seismic shift in the politics of the globe’s second largest economy.
Japanese politics has a dull image in the world’s press.
Most editors, when they cover Japan at all, prefer stories about the zaniness of its popular youth culture, or the wilder shores of Japanese sex.
The main reason for this is, of course, that Japanese politics was dull, at least since the mid-1950s, when the LDP consolidated its monopoly on power.
Only real aficionados of arcane moves inside the ruling party could be bothered to follow the ups and downs of factional bosses, many of whom were from established political families, and most of whom relied on shady financing.
Corruption scandals erupted from time to time, but these, too, were usually part of intra-party maneuvers to rein in politicians who got too big for their britches, or who tried to grab power before their time.
The system worked in a fashion: LDP faction bosses took turns as prime minister, palms were greased by various business interests, more or less capable bureaucrats decided on domestic economic policies, and the United States took care of Japan’s security (and much of its foreign policy, too).
Some thought this system would last forever.
Indeed, it has often been said, by Japanese as well as foreign commentators, that a de facto one-party state suits the Japanese.
Stability, based on soft authoritarianism, is the Asian way, now followed by China.
Asians don’t like the messy contentiousness of parliamentary democracy.
Look what happens when Asians are foolish enough to import such a system, as in South Korea or Taiwan.
Instead of civilized debate, they have filibusters and fisticuffs.
But, notwithstanding the occasional bust-ups, Korean and Taiwanese democracies seem remarkably robust.
And the argument that Japanese, or other Asians, are culturally averse to political competition is not historically true.
In fact, Japanese history is full of strife and rebellion, and Japan was the first independent Asian country with a multi-party system.
Its early postwar democracy was so unruly, with mass demonstrations, militant trade unions, and vigorous left-wing parties, that a deliberate attempt was made to squeeze politics out of the system and impose the boredom of a one-party state.
This happened in the mid-1950’s, not for cultural, but for entirely political reasons.
Like Italy (perhaps the closest European parallel to Japan), Japan was a front-line state in the Cold War.
Domestic conservatives, as well as the US government, worried about the possibility of a left-wing, even Communist takeover.
So a large conservative coalition party (much like the Italian Christian Democrats), funded to some degree by the US, was put in place to marginalize all left-wing opposition.
This involved some strong-arm tactics, especially against the unions, but it worked mostly because the middle class settled for an informal deal: increased material prosperity in exchange for political acquiescence.
The “LDP state” was based on the promise, given by Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato in 1960, that family incomes would soon be doubled.
Increasingly marginalized, the opposition dwindled into an impotent force, mere window-dressing to a one-party state.
But one-party rule breeds complacency, corruption, and political sclerosis.
In the last decade or so, the LDP – as well as the once-almighty bureaucracy that ran the system – began to look incompetent.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi gave the LDP a last breath of life by promising to reform it in 2001.
Whatever he did was not enough.
The patience of Japan’s middle-class, rocked by economic crisis, finally cracked.
The victorious DPJ may not immediately set off any political fireworks.
Its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, is an uncharismatic scion of yet another established dynasty – his grandfather, Hatoyama Ichiro, took over as prime minister in 1954 from Yoshida Shigeru, who was the grandfather of the last LDP Prime Minister Taro Aso.
The DPJ’s aims are excellent: more authority to elected politicians, less bureaucratic meddling, more independence from the US, better relations with Asian neighbors, more power to voters and less to big business, and so on. Whether Hatoyama and his colleagues have the wherewithal to achieve these aims remains an open question.
But it would be wrong to belittle the importance of what has happened.
Even if the DPJ fails to implement most of its reforms in short order, the fact that Japanese voters opted for change will invigorate their country’s democracy.
Even if the system were to become something like Japan’s democracy in the 1920’s, with two more or less conservative parties competing for power, this would still be preferable to a one-party state.
Any opposition is better than none. It keeps the government on its toes.
A firm rejection of the one-party state will also reverberate far beyond Japan’s borders.
It shows clearly that the desire for political choice is not confined to a few fortunate countries, mostly in the Western world.
This is a vital lesson, especially at a time when China’s economic success is convincing too many leaders that citizens, especially but not only in Asia, want to be treated like children.

In the Shadow of Tamarlane

The Skills Deficit
BRUSSELS – Two years after the world economy suffered a nervous breakdown in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, global financial markets remain unsettled, and the recovery that started so vigorously in 2009 seems to be stalling.
The slowdown has predictably led to calls for further fiscal and monetary stimulus.
The argument seems simple: only a massive dose of government spending and massive central-bank support for the financial system prevented a slide into a second Great Depression, so more of the same medicine is now needed to prevent a slide back into recession.
This argument seems particularly strong in the United States, which during the long boom years grew accustomed to unemployment rates of around 5% and steady growth in consumption.
But, in assessing the outlook for the US economy, one should not compare low quarterly growth rates (the data for April-June are particularly disappointing) and the current unemployment rate of almost 10% to the “goldilocks” bubble period.
A longer-term view is required, because the US is facing a structural-adjustment challenge that will be accompanied by high unemployment.
Like Southern Europe, the US economy must move away from the consumption/housing-led growth model of the last decade.
President Barack Obama has encapsulated this challenge by setting the goal of doubling US exports over the next decade.
But this is easier said than done.
The structural shift towards exports will be difficult and time-consuming mainly because producing the high-tech goods that the US should be exporting requires a skilled workforce, which has largely been lost and cannot be re-created overnight.
During the ten years preceding the peak of the bubble in 2007, about four million jobs were lost in the US manufacturing sector, whose share in total employment fell from more than 17% to 12%.
Unemployment remained low because the booming domestic economy created enough jobs in services and construction.
Reversing this shift quickly seems impossible.
Most construction workers are rather low-skilled and thus cannot be re-deployed to modern high-tech manufacturing.
The same applies to real-estate agents, social workers, and managers of credit-card accounts.
During the bubble years, the situation was exactly the opposite: most of the workers released by a rapidly shrinking manufacturing sector could be employed easily in construction and social services, which require only low skills (likewise, real-estate services demand only rather general skills).
The key point is not that manufacturing jobs are somehow better, but rather that we must consider the asymmetry in the structural-adjustment process.
It is relatively easy to manage a structural shift out of manufacturing during a real-estate boom, but it is much more difficult to re-establish a competitive manufacturing sector once it has been lost.
Post-bubble economies thus face a fundamental mismatch between the skills available in the existing work force and the requirements of a modern export-oriented manufacturing sector.
Unfortunately, there is very little that economic policy can do to create a strong exporting sector in the short run, except alleviate the social pain.
Labor-market flexibility is always touted as a panacea, but even the highest degree of it cannot transform unemployed realtors or construction workers into skilled manufacturing specialists.
Experience has also shown that retraining programs have only limited success.
Ironically, Germany might provide the most useful template for the problems facing US policymakers.
Germany experienced a consumption and construction boom after unification, with full employment and a current-account deficit.
After the boom peaked in 1995, one million construction workers were laid off and could not find jobs elsewhere.
The German economy faced a decade of high unemployment and slow growth.
Exports initially did not constitute a path to recovery because the deutsche mark was overvalued, and some manufacturing capacity had been lost during the unification boom. “International competitiveness” became the mantra of German economic policymaking.
But it still took more than ten years for Germany to become the export powerhouse of today.
It is unlikely that the adjustment process will be much faster in the US, where the manufacturing base has shrunk much more sharply.
Moreover, with the introduction of the euro, Germany had the advantage of pegging its currency to Southern Europe, which was experiencing a housing boom even more extreme than in the US, thus providing German exporters with growing markets and little competition.
By contrast, the US dollar is tied to the renminbi, whose issuer – China – has the world’s largest and fastest-growing export sector.
How long will the US adjustment take?
Since the peak of the bubble, the US economy has not even been moving in the right direction.
The contraction in manufacturing output and employment has actually accelerated – and faster than output and employment have fallen in the sectors on which the economy remains dependent for much of its growth: domestic services, such as health care, and finance, insurance, and real-estate services (the sector responsible for the crisis).
So long as this trend continues, only high and continuing doses of fiscal and monetary expansion will be able to sustain domestic demand.
And, given that many goods are no longer produced in the US, stimulus measures would suck in more imports, further undermining the trade balance.
A self-sustaining recovery is, of course, possible, but it presupposes a massive structural adjustment aimed at restoring US competitiveness in global markets.

France’s Broken Dream
CAMBRIDGE – The crisis in the eurozone is the result of France’s persistent pursuit of the “European project,” the goal of political unification that began after World War II when two leading French politicians, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, proposed the creation of a United States of Europe.
Monnet and Schuman argued that a political union similar to America’s would prevent the types of conflict that had caused three major European wars – an appealing idea, but one that overlooked America’s horrific Civil War.
A European political union could also make Europe a power comparable to the United States, and thereby give France, with its sophisticated foreign service, an important role in European and world affairs.
The Monnet-Schuman dream led to the 1956 Treaty of Rome, which established a small free-trade area that was later expanded to form the European Economic Community.
Establishing the EEC had favorable economic effects, but, like the North American Free Trade Area, it did not reduce national identification or create a sense of political unity.
That was the purpose of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union.
The influential report “One market, one money,” issued in 1990 under the leadership of the former French Finance Minister Jacques Delors, called for the creation of a single currency, relying on the specious argument that the single market could not function well otherwise.
More realistically, advocates of a single currency reasoned that it would cause people to identify as Europeans, and that the shift to a single European Central Bank would herald a shift of power away from national governments.
Germany resisted the euro, arguing that full political union should come first.
Since there was no chance that the other countries would accept political union, Germany’s position seemed like a technical maneuver to prevent the establishment of the single currency.
Germany was reluctant to give up the Deutsche Mark, a symbol of its economic power and commitment to price stability.
Germany eventually agreed to the creation of the euro only when French President François Mitterrand made it a condition of France’s support for German reunification.
Moreover, under pressure from France, the Maastricht Treaty’s requirement that countries could introduce the euro only if their national debt was less than 60% of GDP was relaxed in order to admit countries that were seen to be “evolving” toward that goal.
That modification allowed Greece, Spain, and Italy to be admitted.
The pro-euro politicians ignored economists’ warnings that imposing a single currency on a dozen heterogeneous countries was bound to create serious economic problems.
They regarded the economic risks as unimportant relative to their agenda of political unification.
But the creation of the euro caused a sharp fall in interest rates in the peripheral countries, leading to debt-financed housing bubbles and encouraging their governments to borrow to finance increased government spending.
Amazingly, global financial markets ignored the credit risks of this sovereign debt, requiring only very small differences between interest rates on German bonds and those of Greece and other peripheral countries.
That ended in 2010, after Greece admitted that it had lied about its budget deficits and debt.
Financial markets responded by demanding much higher rates on the bonds of countries with high government debt ratios and banking systems weakened by excessive mortgage debt.
Three small countries (Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) have been forced to accept help from the International Monetary Fund, and to enact painful contractionary fiscal cuts.
The conditions in Greece are now hopeless, and are likely to lead to further defaults and a withdrawal from the eurozone.
Spain, too, is in serious trouble, owing to the budget deficits of its traditionally independent regional governments, the weakness of its banks, and its need to roll over large sovereign-debt balances each year.
It is already clear that the EU’s recently agreed “fiscal compact” will not constrain budget deficits or reduce national debts.
Spain was the first to insist that it could not meet the conditions to which it had just agreed, and other countries will soon follow.
French President François Hollande has proposed balancing deficit limits with growth initiatives, just as France had earlier forced the EU’s Stability Pact to become the Stability and Growth Pact.
The fiscal compact is an empty gesture that may be the last attempt to pretend that EU members are moving toward political unification.
The European project has clearly failed to achieve what French political leaders have wanted from the beginning.
Instead of the amity and sense of purpose of which Monnet and Schuman dreamed, there is conflict and disarray.
Europe’s international role is shrinking, with the old G-5 having evolved into the G-20.
And, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel setting conditions for the eurozone, France’s ambition to dominate European policy has been thwarted.
Even if most eurozone countries retain the single currency, it will be because abandoning the euro would be financially painful.
Now that its weaknesses are clear, the euro will remain a source of trouble rather than a path to political power.

How Climate Targets Can Help Economic Recovery
SANTIAGO – With the world gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers have turned their attention to economic stimulus and financial support of households and firms.
As a result, many countries have been delaying the preparation and submission of their new emissions-reduction targets under the Paris climate agreement.
These updated targets, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, were originally due earlier this year, ahead of the COP26 climate-change conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November. But that, too, has been postponed.
The switch from summits to stimulus is understandable. But we should not lose sight of the important role that NDCs can play in economic recovery efforts.
NDCs are among the best vehicles for governments to articulate their vision of future economic growth and technological transformation, both of which have clear links to job creation.
Moreover, setting the targets provides a golden opportunity for countries to identify shovel-ready projects and activities that can deliver both climate and economic benefits.
Chile is a good example.
The government announced an updated climate pledge in April, together with a new climate bill that is currently before the National Congress.
The updated NDC links climate action to sustainable development and a just energy transition.
At its core is a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it is easy to see how the government’s pandemic response can help to achieve this goal by accelerating the necessary transitions in the energy and transportation sectors.
But Chile’s new NDC also shows another front where countries’ economic recovery plans can receive a significant boost: nature-based solutions.
The NDC demonstrates an understanding of the role nature can play in achieving carbon neutrality, as well as in adapting to the effects of climate change and recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining natural carbon sinks.
For starters, Chile’s climate plan links ocean and climate health, while acknowledging the economic value of coastal ecosystems.
We don’t need to look far for an example of how healthy marine ecosystems support local economies.
In Mexico, in the Gulf of California and the Baja California Peninsula alone, marine ecosystems generate $518 million in annual tourism revenues and directly account for at least 3,575 jobs.
Given Chile’s extensive coastline, the possibilities are much likely orders of magnitude higher.
The NDC does not disappoint in this regard: It includes a commitment to turn 25% of its exclusive economic zone into a protected area.
If properly implemented, this pledge would create new economic opportunities for the country.
The new NDC also significantly strengthens Chile’s commitments regarding forests.
The government has doubled its target for sustainable forests management and restoration from 100,000 hectares to 200,000 hectares by 2030.
Likewise, it will plant 200,000 hectares of new forests (up from 100,000 hectares), of which at least 100,000 hectares will comprise permanent forest cover and at least 70,000 hectares will be native species.
Finally, Chile has said it will cut emissions from deforestation and land degradation by 25% by 2030.
The link to economic growth (albeit understudied and underappreciated) is clear here as well.
Pursuing these targets will enable governments to create a variety of jobs, including foresters, botanists, machinery operators, and laborers.
And restored landscapes offer additional benefits.
A 2016 study by the World Resources Institute found that in Latin America, reviving degraded lands would yield $23 billion in net benefits over a period of 50 years.
On average, farmers who restore their land can earn an extra $1,140 per hectare in net economic value.
Let’s be clear: Chile still has some way to go to achieve the targets in its original climate pledge.
The government’s response to COVID-19 has thus far been a mixed bag, and it has yet to demonstrate any serious commitment to advancing climate action since releasing the plan months ago.
But, at the very least, Chile’s NDC gives us a good example of what an NDC can and should be: not a legally binding policy document, but a political signal to ministries, private-sector actors, and development-finance institutions to identify and pursue opportunities to link a government’s climate plans to economic recovery.
Each updated NDC creates greater political momentum and builds the international trust we need to combat climate change.
Instead of delaying work on the NDCs while the pandemic continues, governments should consider how these targets could be used to leverage the economic contribution of nature-based solutions.
In short, climate action, as expressed through an NDC, can go hand in hand with economic recovery plans.
When nature is protected, it has much to offer in return.

The Politics of Young and Old
PARIS – If one considers some of today’s main challenges – including climate change, pensions, public debt, and the labor market – an obvious conclusion emerges: It is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quarter-century ago. Yet in most countries, the generational dimension is remarkably absent from the political debate.
Start with climate change. Its containment requires changing habits and investing in emission reductions so that future generations will have a habitable planet.
The alarm bell was first rung in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; but over the last generation, little was done to contain emissions.
And progress following the landmark agreement achieved in Paris in December is unlikely to be fast, because the accord is premised on postponing major efforts.
Universal assent was made possible only by further delaying.
Given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect, the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter-century, and major consequences will follow only in 50 years.
Anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios.
But the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected.
In due course, the respite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones.
Now consider debt. Since 1990, public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of GDP in the European Union and the United States (and much more in Japan).
Given near-zero interest rates, the corresponding drag on income is currently low; but, because inflation is virtually inexistent and growth is anemic, the debt ratios have only stabilized.
So debt reduction will take longer than expected in the aftermath of the global crisis, which will deprive the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the containment of security threats.
Future pensions represent another form of debt.
The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems in place in many countries are giant intergenerational transfer schemes.
True, everyone is expected to contribute while they work, before becoming a recipient in retirement.
In an ideal steady state, pension regimes would not redistribute income across cohorts born at different points in time. As specialists say, they would be generationally neutral.
But the baby boomers (those born from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s) paid little into the PAYG schemes because economic growth, population size, and their parents’ low life expectancy made financing pensions easy.
All these factors have now gone into reverse: Growth has slowed, the baby boomers are a demographic bulge weighing on their children, and they are expected to live long.
Countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resulting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair.
But countries where reforms were delayed have allowed that balance to place the young at a disadvantage.
Over the last decade, conditions for new entrants have worsened markedly in many countries. The number of young people categorized as NEET (neither in employment nor in education or training) currently stands at 10.2 million in the US and 14 million in the EU.
Furthermore, many of those who have recently entered the labor market have suffered from job insecurity and repeated spells of unemployment. In continental Europe, especially, young workers are the first to suffer from economic downturns.
On all of these issues – climate, debt, pensions, and jobs – the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quarter-century.
A telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly.
This ought to be a major political issue, with significant implications for public finances, social protection, tax policy, and labor market regulation.
And it reinforces the imperative of reviving growth through productivity-boosting policies.
Yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect.
It hardly arises in electoral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements.
Instead, the generational divide shows up in electoral participation.
In the latest US mid-term elections, the turnout rate among younger citizens was less than 20%, compared to more than 50% for senior voters. Similar trends are observable in other countries.
Despite the increased uncertainty they face, younger citizens are much more disengaged from electoral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age.
This generational gap in electoral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young.
But in aging societies, the more the young abstain from voting, the more decisions by parliaments and governments will be biased against their interests.
True, parents are generally not selfish. They help their children through private transfers and grants.
But only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support. The result of neglecting young people collectively while supporting them privately is social inequality on a massive scale.
How to redress generational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies.
Solutions do exist: mandatory voting, term limits for elected officials, and youth parliaments or special bodies to examine intergenerational issues, for example.
But such measures are either difficult to implement or only moderately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges.
Current trends are clearly unsustainable politically and socially.
What is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard.

Turkey's Final Act?
CAMBRIDGE: Turkey has been escaping trouble seemingly forever.
As an escape artist, indeed, it even beats Brazil!
But the bill for this bravura performance keeps growing: high and rising debt, high and rising deficits, very high inflation.
All are symptoms of Turkey's perverted politics.
Dodgy politics usually means four things: first, cover up and avoid government transparency like the pest that it is for wayward politicians. Second, procrastinate on all but inevitable adjustments, because reform, restructuring and cleaning up financial messes never attracts new cronies.
Third, keep spending and paying off anyone who risks upsetting the process. Lastly, don't take too dogmatic a view of corruption and or the looting of the public coffers; they are part of the system.
An IMF program in 2000 was meant to offer a framework for Turkey to work its way out of its troubles.
But as is the way with exchange rate-based programs, interest rates were indeed brought down and imports made cheap, creating a boom that undermined the viability of the disinflation strategy.
What politician, after all, says no to a boom?
Act I started last December, with a financial crisis to blow Turkey's cozily corrupt system wide open.
In haste, the IMF arrived on the scene, waving $10 billion at the problem.
It soon seemed to have restored some normality. Not quite, because interest rates remained high and creditors remained alarmed.
The precariousness of the situation called for early and dramatic declines in interest rates driven by an early restoration in confidence.
In February, however, the opposite happened: political support for the IMF program broke down when President and Prime Minister had a shouting match.
Act II began with a renewed speculative attack and a deep collapse of the currency.
Turkey has imported an economics minister from the World Bank - Kemal Dervis, an able man, though not someone very familiar with the speculative financiers preying on the country.
When Brazil hit the ropes, it imported Arminio Fraga, a senior trader for the financier George Soros, who quickly imposed himself and accomplished miracles.
The same may happen in Turkey but its politics are harder and public finances far more troublesome.
Hence the skepticism, hence the expectation that Act III may open soon.
Turkey entered its crisis with a woeful budget and a very high public debt.
It has since added formidably to its debt liabilities.
Estimates suggest that cleaning up the banking system would eat up some 25% of GDP in extra public debt (about $40 billion), over and above the 60% already in place.
Why an increase in public debt?
Because who else will pay for cleaning up Turkey's banks?
If postponed, moreover, costs will rise.
At this point two complications come together.
First, in order to stem the inflationary impact of a currency collapse, the central bank imposes extremely high real interest rates.
Of course, that makes the budget deficit larger and keeps debt growing fast.
It also means that private debts quickly become unpayable, more so because a recession is coming.
In turn, that means the bank clean up will cost more and more and that public debts will grow more and more.
What happens in the end?
Another blow up.
Turkey's public debt is simply unpayable.
Neither the G7, the IMF nor the World Bank will pay it off.
There are two ways Turkey's debt can go.
First, it can be inflated away - a currency collapse fed by money creation until the debt disappears in a whirl of inflation.
Historically, this is what happens in countries weighed down by large debts.
Of course, the social consequences are deeply traumatic; witness Europe in the 1920s.
The alternative is for government to write down public debt and bank deposits, giving creditors and depositors "hair cuts."
Politically that is more deliberate and therefore very unlikely.
So how is the Turkish government dealing with the inevitable?
By not dealing with it!
Avoiding reality is always a short term option.
But stalling only assures that debts will grow, economic normalization is postponed and the final explosion at the end of ACT III even bigger.
There is no EMU-trick, such as that which benefited Italy a few years ago, that will defuse the situation.
There is no volunteer like Germany or the US Treasury willing to dip into its deep pockets.
Turkey is on a path to a dramatic financial crash that risks throwing the country out of its precarious political situation and into the unknown.
Historically very nasty answers emerge in such situations.
Turkey is already formidably divided, so look for a strong man to ride in, probably on a tank.
What could avoid this?
Immediate debt restructuring on a grand scale, biting the bullet and accepting a few painful years of retrenchment.
That, however, is not the kind of message elected Prime Ministers want to hear.

Egypt’s Dead Men Walking
CAIRO – Mass death sentences are usually associated with regimes like those of Adolf Hitler’s Nazis or Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge.
But Egypt’s military rulers have now joined the ranks of such regimes, staging circus-like trials in which the outcome is foreordained.
One such trial, in March 2014, produced 529 death sentences; another, in April, yielded 683 death sentences.
And the trend shows no signs of slowing.
Last month, 107 people – including Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first freely elected president – were handed death sentences for their alleged role in a mass “prison break” during the January 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak.
Morsi was also accused of “colluding with foreign militants” – that is, Hezbollah and Hamas – in order to free political prisoners in Egypt.
Soon after, the six defendants in the so-called “Arab Sharkas” case – who were handed death sentences in October 2014 for allegedly attacking security posts – were executed, despite a local and international outcry against the flawed trial.
According to Ahmed Helmi, a lawyer for four of the six men, the government wanted to “send a message following Morsi’s verdict” that it would carry out such sentences.
His clients and the others, he concluded, were just “scapegoats.”
Overall, civilian courts have handed down more than 1,000 death sentences since Egypt’s military overthrew Morsi in July 2013.
The profiles of the “convicts” raise eyebrows: Emad Shahin, for example, is a world-renowned academic who has taught at Harvard and the American University in Cairo; Sondos Asem is a promising young scholar and political activist.
Making matters worse, extra-judicial killings by the security services and elements in the military are rampant.
The most dramatic of these episodes accompanied the coup in July 2013, when Egyptian police and army opened fire on crowds protesting Morsi’s ouster in Cairo’s Rab’a Square, killing more than 1,000 protesters in less than ten hours.
More recently, Islam Atito, an engineering student at Cairo’s Ain Shams University who supported the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was found dead in the desert on the outskirts of Cairo.
Egypt’s interior ministry claimed that Atito had been involved in the “assassination” of a police officer and was killed in a firefight with security forces during a raid on his “hideout.”
But according to the student union of the university’s engineering faculty – whose members collectively resigned in protest against the killing – Atito was arrested during a final exam on the university campus.
The government, it is claimed, had Atito abducted and murdered in response to his activism.
As a human-rights lawyer monitoring the case notes, this is just one of several such cases – none of which is being seriously investigated.
These judicial and extra-judicial killings reflect the depth of Egypt’s current crisis.
The “hawks” who control the security and military establishments seem intent on restoring a Mubarak-style regime, but with one key difference: they believe that Mubarak did too little to repress the opposition.
For Egypt’s current leadership, the brutal tactics employed by the likes of Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad are more likely to work in the Egyptian context than in those countries.
After all, the probability of international intervention (as in Libya) is nil, and the likelihood of a full-fledged armed revolution (as in Syria) is extremely limited.
But relying on force to subdue dissent in a country where 70% of the population is under the age of 30 will be a major challenge, if not resulting in a bloodbath.
The brutal policies of Egypt’s hawks have also transformed the opposition.
At a 2013 sit-in protesting Morsi’s ouster, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Supreme Guide, Mohamed Badie, declared, in what became a rallying cry for the movement, “Our peacefulness is stronger than their bullets.” But, with Badie having since been sentenced to death in multiple cases (including one related to attacks on police stations in the southern province of Minya), the phrase has become the subject of bitter mockery among young political activists, including Brotherhood members.
Rassd, a Brotherhood-affiliated news website, recently published a letter (link in Arabic) by the group’s former secretary-general, Mahmoud Ghozlan, asserting that the “revolution” will continue to be non-violent.
But it also published harsh criticism of Ghozlan’s position by young Brotherhood activists – a notable development for an organization in which dissent is rarely publicized.
In fact, anger among younger members has become so acute that the Brotherhood has allegedly changed some 65% of its leadership, according to Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, the head of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Administrative Office Abroad (a new body that organizes the thousands of Brotherhood members now in exile).
The organization has also adopted a harsher line, having publicly stated that the “reformist” approach that its government took after winning parliamentary and presidential elections in 2011 and 2012 was “wrong”, and that excluding non-Islamist revolutionary youth groups was a “major mistake.”
Given Egypt’s mass death sentences, extrajudicial violence, and the dominance of hawks in the security and the military establishments, together with the rhetorical, behavioral, and organizational changes within the Muslim Brotherhood, the chances of reconciliation are fading by the day.
In an environment in which “compromise” is regarded as a dirty word, Egypt’s future appears to be far from bright.

Europe's House Divided
Travelling from Berlin to Riga, Latvia's capital, is an eye-opener, because you get to see much of what is going wrong in European integration nowadays, just months before a further 10 states join the European Union, bringing it up to 25 from the original 6.
In Berlin before I left, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had just welcomed his French and British colleagues for an exchange of views on the state and future of the Union.
They were, the chiefs of the three largest members of the EU declared, only advancing proposals; nothing could be further from their minds than to form a steering group to run the affairs of the enlarged Union, even if henceforth they would meet again at more or less regular intervals.
If they really hoped to be believed, they should have listened to my interlocutors in the old city of Riga over the next few days.
The three Baltic countries - Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania - will be among the smallest members when they join the Union on May 1, 2004, their total of 6 million people representing just 1.5% of the then EU's population.
Yet in marked contrast to the smaller nations that half a century earlier had joined France, Italy and Germany in launching the Union's fore-runner, the European Economic Community, the new arrivals are digging in their heels, demanding equal rights.
Although as small countries they have learnt that the big ones usually get their way, they deeply resented the Berlin meeting because they see in it an attempt to limit their rights in the club they are about to join.
The attitudes of the EU's big and small countries suggests that European integration's basic bargain is no longer regarded as fair.
Under that bargain, the bigger states accepted restraints on their power in order to increase the weight of the Union as a whole while the smaller ones realized that being part of the club gave them a chance they would not have otherwise, namely to participate in the shaping of common policies.
Europe, once the continent of power clashes and balances, became a community of law where big and small follow common rules to reach common decisions.
Now, as Berlin and Riga suggest, power is returning as the trump card.
The authority of the big countries derives not from their European credentials but from their power ranking; the resentment of the smaller countries flows not from a different notion of integration but from their fear of losing out.
What used to succeed as a win-win arrangement for big and small alike, now appears as a zero-sum game to many of them.
There are explanations for this.
In a Union of soon 25 members, it will be increasingly difficult to let everyone have a say and to generate consensus.
On issues of foreign and security policy, moreover, agreement among the heavy-weights of the Union is essential for common action.
Unless France, Britain and Germany agree, there is little chance the Union can act effectively on the international stage.
At the same time, giving up sovereignty for the sake of integration is tough for the new members from Eastern Europe that only a decade ago wrested the right to govern themselves from Soviet control.
Yet big and small alike must realize that their current disposition implies the slow suffocation of Europe's most exciting and successful experiment in bringing peace and prosperity to the old continent.
To save it, the bigger ones will indeed have to take the lead.
But instead of offering ready solutions for the rest to endorse, leadership will have to consist of working with the other members, patiently and discretely, so that all or at last most feel they are involved in formulating common positions.
Only then will the smaller members feel adequately respected.
Only then will all members again concentrate on getting things done for all instead of each of them on getting the most out of it for himself.
There are many who believe that this kind of patient leadership is incompatible with a Union of 25.
France and Germany, acting together, were able for many years to provide this sort of leadership, and this should be recalled.
Whenever they came out with a proposal, the others gave them credit that it was in the interest of the Union as a whole; whenever there was a deadlock, the others looked for leadership from Paris and Bonn/Berlin to overcome it.
In the past, German governments rightly took pride in being seen by the smaller members as their best partner, essential for the Franco-German leadership to work.
Today, Germany has joined France in neglecting the smaller members for the sake of being recognized as one of the big boys.
So the Franco-German couple has lost the credit it once enjoyed.
Bringing in Britain is an admission of that fact.
But because Britain remains lukewarm on European integration, the threesome can never serve as the motor for moving Europe forward.
Even in an enlarged Union, only France and Germany can do that job, provided they make a determined effort to regain the trust of the other, mostly smaller members, old and new.
While these expect little from an often indifferent France, they still, as the discussions in Riga suggest, would be disposed to putting their trust in Germany -- if only German governments once again show they care.

François Hollande Meets the World
PARIS – When François Hollande, fresh from his election as France’s next president, was asked by a journalist which language he would use when he meets US President Barack Obama for the first time, his answer was revealing. “I speak English more fluently than the former president,” the Socialist leader insisted, referring to the outgoing Nicolas Sarkozy.
In proclaiming his mastery of the lingua franca of global affairs, Hollande was asserting himself as a modern statesman, while also suggesting that France will remain as influential as possible on the international scene.
Indeed, he was proclaiming his commitment to internationalism and multilateralism.
In order to remain a country that punches above its weight diplomatically, it is in France’s interest to operate through international organizations rather than to rely on bilateral relationships.
Hollande is also aware that, for historical and cultural reasons, France’s international role must be different from that of other countries.
In his book Changer de destin (Changing Destiny), published in February, he affirms that France’s message will continue to be a universal one – a stance reminiscent of the birth in 1789 of the French Republic, which, like the United States, was originally conceived as the triumph of liberty and democracy.
Unlike in France, however, the word “socialist” is an epithet for most Americans.
But this could be a source of strength for Hollande, who, as a new leader with no foreign-policy experience, will have to prove his ability through action.
And here, Obama, in particular, will soon understand that Hollande has no intention of bringing sweeping change.
On the contrary, his intention will be to appear as a reliable and unsurprising partner.
Hollande is unlikely to be less friendly with America than was Sarkozy, regarded by many as France’s most pro-US president.
Hollande supported the military intervention in Libya in 2011, and has joined the condemnation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
One of his close political allies recently declared that should the United Nations Security Council approve military intervention in Syria, France “could envision” participating in that effort.
Hollande also supports a tough line on Iran and, regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, his book indicates that he subscribes to the “Clinton parameters” – two states with secure borders and a status for Jerusalem that is acceptable to both sides.
With regard to relations between France and the Arab world, one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech.
Last but not least, Hollande is not likely to call into question Sarkozy’s decision in 2009 to reintegrate France into NATO’s military command.
That decision remains controversial in France, including among Socialists, but Hollande is well aware of the weaknesses of a European defense policy that simply cannot compete with NATO.
Nevertheless, at the NATO Summit in Chicago at the end of May, Hollande will confirm his pledge to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, two years ahead of the NATO timetable (though he recognizes the need to negotiate the practical details).
This will be an important test of Hollande’s ability to deal effectively with allies.
The second test of his ability to negotiate with other leaders will be within Europe.
One of the highest-flying proposals of his electoral platform was a call for renegotiation of the European Union’s new “fiscal pact,” endorsed by all member states with the exception of the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic.
Inspired by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, approval of the pact was a precondition for Germany’s participation in the financial rescue plan for Greece and the other distressed eurozone countries.
Hollande’s proposal was initially regarded as lèse-majesté against Germany.
Now all European leaders – from Mario Monti in Italy to Mariano Rajoy in Spain and Elio Di Rupo in Belgium – agree on the need to revive the European economy.
So do Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy, and, indeed, Merkel herself.
Merkel and Hollande will discuss the main question – how to spur economic growth without increasing public debt – on May 15 in Berlin.
While Merkel opposes Hollande’s proposal to create Eurobonds with a view to financing industrial projects, they cannot afford to waste time in reassuring jittery markets with a message of cohesion.
Merkel has already welcomed Hollande’s ideas for a growth plan for Europe.
Hollande, too, will have to make concessions.
For the French, as for all Europeans, the EU is not a foreign entity, and its decisions are an integral part of domestic policies.
In this regard, Hollande has a chance to succeed on the international scene as a truly pro-European leader.
Only a stronger Europe will ensure fair trade with emerging countries, especially China.
Only a stronger Europe will at last implement the principle of reciprocity in order to protect European businesses and prevent them from relocating, which has been the main cause of unemployment.
In a recent interview, Hollande declared that, “France is not just any European country, and its president is not just any world leader.”
The French are happy to hear that.
But that affirmation also represents Hollande’s main challenge: ensuring that this remains true in the context of twenty-first-century globalization.

Ending the Syrian War
NEW YORK – Syria is currently the world’s greatest humanitarian catastrophe and most dangerous geopolitical hotspot.
The Syrian people are caught in a bloodbath, with more than 400,000 dead and ten million displaced.
Violent jihadist groups backed by outside patrons mercilessly ravage the country and prey on the population.
All parties to the conflict – President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, the anti-Assad forces supported by the United States and its allies, and the Islamic State – have committed, and continue to commit, serious war crimes.
It is time for a solution.
But such a solution must be based on a transparent and realistic account of what caused the war in the first place.
The chronology is as follows.
In February 2011, peaceful protests were staged in Syria’s major cities, amid the region-wide phenomenon dubbed the “Arab Spring.”
The Assad regime reacted with a shifting mix of violent repression (shooting at demonstrators) and offers of reform.
Soon, the violence escalated.
Assad’s opponents accused the regime of using force against civilians without restraint, while the government pointed to the deaths of soldiers and policeman as evidence of violent jihadists among the protestors.
It seems likely that as early as March or April 2011, Sunni anti-regime fighters and arms started to enter Syria from neighboring countries.
Many eyewitness accounts tell of foreign jihadists engaging in violent attacks on policemen.
(Such accounts are, however, hard to confirm, especially after almost five years.)
The US and its regional allies tried to nudge Assad from power in the spring of 2011, thinking that he would fall quickly like Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Many observers assert that Qatar funded an increase in anti-regime activity within Syria and used the Doha-based broadcaster Al Jazeera to boost anti-Assad sentiment worldwide, though such claims are hard to pin down definitively.
The US imposed a tightening noose of trade and financial sanctions on the regime.
The Brookings Institution, a bellwether of US official policy, called for Assad’s ouster, and anti-Assad propaganda in the US media soared. (Until then, Assad was considered in the US media to be a relatively benign, albeit authoritarian, ruler, and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noted as late as March 2011 that many in the US Congress regarded Assad as a reformer.)
The launch of the war can be dated to August 18, 2011, when President Barack Obama and Clinton declared that “Assad must go.”
Up to that point, the violence was still containable.
Total deaths, including both civilians and combatants, ran perhaps to around 2,900 (according to one tally by regime opponents).
After August, the death rate soared.
It is sometimes claimed that the US did not act vigorously at this point.
Obama’s political foes generally attack him for having taken too little action, not too much.
But the US did in fact act to topple Assad, albeit mostly covertly and through allies, especially Saudi Arabia and Turkey (though neither country needed much prodding to intervene).
The CIA and Saudi Arabia covertly coordinated their actions.
Of course, the chronology of the war does not explain it.
For that, we need to examine the motivations of the key actors.
First and foremost, the war in Syria is a proxy war, involving mainly the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran.
The US and its allies, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, started the war in 2011 in order to overthrow Assad’s regime.
The US alliance was met with escalating counterforce by Russia and Iran, whose Lebanese proxy army Hezbollah is fighting alongside Assad’s government.
The US interest in overthrowing Assad’s regime was precisely its reliance on Iranian and Russian backing.
Removing Assad, US security officials believed, would weaken Iran, undermine Hezbollah, and roll back Russia’s geopolitical reach.
America’s allies, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, were interested in replacing Assad’s Alawite regime in Syria with a Sunni-led regime (Alawites are a branch of Shia Islam).
This, they believed, would also weaken their regional competitor, Iran, and curtail Shia influence in the Middle East more generally.
In believing that Assad would be easily overthrown, the US – not for the first time – was relying on its own propaganda.
The regime faced deep opposition, but also had considerable internal support.
More important, the regime had powerful allies, notably Iran and Russia.
It was naive to believe that neither would respond.
The public should appreciate the dirty nature of the CIA-led fight.
The US and its allies flooded Syria with Sunni jihadists, just as the US had flooded Afghanistan in the 1980s with Sunni jihadists (the Mujahideen) that later became Al Qaeda.
Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and the US have regularly backed some of the most violent jihadist groups in a cynical miscalculation that these proxies would do their dirty work and then somehow be pushed aside.
According to the US and European mainstream media, Russia’s military intervention in Syria is treacherous and expansionist.
The truth is different.
The US is not allowed under the UN Charter to organize an alliance, fund mercenaries, and smuggle heavy weapons to overthrow another country’s government.
Russia in this case is reacting, not acting.
It is responding to US provocations against its ally.
Ending the war requires adherence to six principles.
First, the US should cease both overt and covert operations to overthrow Syria’s government.
Second, the UN Security Council should implement the ceasefire now under negotiation, calling on all countries, including the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and Iran, to stop arming and funding military forces within Syria.
Third, all paramilitary activities should cease, including those of so-called “moderates” backed by the US.
Fourth, the US and Russia – and, indeed, the UN Security Council – should hold Syria’s government strictly responsible to desist from punitive actions against regime opponents. Fifth, the political transition should take place gradually and with confidence building on all sides, rather than through an arbitrary, destabilizing rush to “free elections.”
Finally, the Gulf States, Turkey, and Iran should be pressed to negotiate face to face on a regional framework that can ensure lasting peace.
Arabs, Turks, and Iranians have all lived with each other for millennia.
They, not the outside powers, should lead the way to a stable order in the region.

Why We Need “Game of Thrones”
PARIS – Today’s popular television programs have become the equivalent of the feuilletons that began appearing in newspapers in the nineteenth century.
Series like “Game of Thrones” and “Downton Abbey,” like Balzac and Dickens before them, serve as a source of entertainment and fodder for debate.
In this sense, our television screenplays have emerged as key tools of social and political analysis.
Such tools can be used to comprehend, for example, the difference between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama.
Netanyahu is still stuck in the third season of “Homeland” – that is, obsessed with Iran – whereas Obama, having begun to include the renewed Russian threat in his strategic calculus, has already moved into the third season of “House of Cards.”
Of course, the availability of such comparisons is rooted in what often drives a TV series’ popularity: its ability to hold up a mirror to a society – to reflect its anxieties and longings – and create a window through which outsiders can peer in.
Consider “Downton Abbey,” a British period drama that follows the lives of the Crawley family and its servants in the family’s classic country house, from 1912 to the mid-1920s.
Why are millions of people worldwide – from Europe to the United States to Asia – so attracted to these characters?
Are they nostalgic for a time long past, which the show reconstitutes with exacting verisimilitude?
Or are they fascinated by the social dynamics that the show explores?
For Julian Fellowes, who created the series, the explanation lies elsewhere – in our search for order in a chaotic world.
People feel so disoriented nowadays, he believes, that they are drawn to “Downton Abbey’s” tidy realm, in which the setting, clearly delineated in space and time, is governed by strict rules.
Just as the Crawley house serves as a kind of refuge for its characters, it may give its viewers a safe, predictable outlet by which to escape the tumultuous present – and avoid the unknown future.
Similarly, the American political drama “House of Cards” reflects a kind of disillusionment – this time, with US politics.
Whereas “The West Wing,” a popular political drama that ran from 1999 to 2006, portrays the US presidency – held by a sophisticated, cultivated, and humanistic leader – with a kind of longing, “House of Cards” immerses the viewer in a murky milieu of humanity’s worst impulses.
In “House of Cards,” the world is not as viewers believe it should be, but as they fear it is.
This is the opposite of the approach taken by the Danish political drama “Borgen,” which presents an idealized prime minister, Birgitte Nyborg.
But the effect is similar. One often hears people saying that the true problem facing Denmark – and, in particular, its political class – is that Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lacks Nyborg’s strengths.
By exposing the fundamental challenges and anxieties facing a society, a TV series can, at times, almost prefigure the future.
In France, “Engrenages” – sold in English under the title “Spiral” – explores the deep malaise of French society.
In retrospect, the series seems to have foreshadowed the tragedies that beset the country in January.
In particular, the fifth season, which aired in France in late 2014, offered a clinical description of how young people in the Paris suburbs went astray, while portraying the relationship between the police and their political superiors as cynical and even combative.
The show’s dialogue could have come straight out of a real-life Parisian “power lunch.”
The TV show that has emerged as the most hotly debated of our time is, without a doubt, “Game of Thrones,” a medieval fantasy epic based (increasingly loosely) on George R.R. Martin’s best-selling book series A Song of Ice and Fire.
The series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling, but also for its sustained choreography of brutal violence.
Students of international politics, especially in Canada and the US, wonder whether the show, by stressing the role of sheer brutality, encourages a“realist” vision of the world.
Could the savagery featured on “Games of Thrones” – including abundant beheadings, rape, and sexual torture – have helped to encourage the tactics of, say, Boko Haram and the Islamic State?
Or could the series – in which violence often begets more violence, but does not necessarily get the characters what they want – actually be highlighting the limits of force?
On a more philosophical level, the show’s universe – a combination of ancient mythology and the Middle Ages – seems to capture the mixture of fascination and fear that many people nowadays feel.
It is a fantastic, unpredictable, and devastatingly painful world – one that is so complex that even the show’s most loyal viewers often are confused.
In this sense, it is much like the world in which we live.
Though the West has no monopoly on the production of TV series, it undoubtedly dominates the field – and thus the worldview that such shows reflect.
Given this, one might wonder whether Chinese or Russian leaders are making time in their busy schedules to watch series such as “House of Cards” or “Games of Thrones,” in order to understand their rivals’ mentality.
Leading government advisers, at least, seem to recognize the value of tuning in.
A Chinese friend recently told me that “House of Cards” was very popular among China’s political elite.
They relish the reminder that politics is just as ruthless in the US as it is at home.

The COVID Shock to the Dollar
NEW HAVEN – Pandemic time runs at warp speed.
That’s true of the COVID-19 infection rate, as well as the unprecedented scientific efforts under way to find a vaccine.
It is also true of transformational developments currently playing out in pandemic-affected economies.
Just as a lockdown-induced recession brought global economic activity to a virtual standstill in a mere two months, hopes for a V-shaped recovery are premised on an equally quick reopening of shuttered economies.
It may not be so simple.
A sudden stop – long associated with capital flight out of emerging markets – often exposes deep-rooted structural problems that can impair economic recovery.
It can also spark abrupt asset-price movements in response to the unmasking of long-simmering imbalances.
Such is the case for the pandemic-stricken US economy.
The aggressive fiscal response to the COVID-19 shock is not without major consequences.
Contrary to the widespread belief that budget deficits don’t matter because near-zero interest rates temper any increases in debt-servicing costs, in the end there is no “magic money” or free lunch.
Domestic saving, already depressed, is headed deep into negative territory.
This is likely to lead to a record current-account deficit and an outsize plunge in the value of the dollar.
No country can afford to squander its saving potential – ultimately, the seed-corn of long-term economic growth.
That’s true even of the United States, where the laws of economics have often been ignored under the guise of “American exceptionalism.”
Alas, nothing is forever.
The COVID-19 crisis is an especially tough blow for a country that has long been operating on a razor-thin margin of subpar saving.
Heading into the pandemic, America’s net domestic saving rate – the combined depreciation-adjusted saving of households, businesses, and the government sector – stood at just 1.4% of national income, falling back to the post-crisis low of late 2011.
No need to worry, goes the conventional excuse – America never saves.
Think again.
The net national saving rate averaged 7% over the 45-year period from 1960 to 2005.
And during the 1960s, long recognized as the strongest period of productivity-led US economic growth in the post-World War II era, the net saving rate actually averaged 11.5%.
Expressing these calculations in net terms is no trivial adjustment.
Although gross domestic saving in the first quarter of 2020, at 17.8% of national income, was also well below its 45-year norm of 21% from 1960 to 2005, the shortfall was not as severe as that captured by the net measure.
That reflects another worrisome development: America’s rapidly aging and increasingly obsolete stock of productive capital.
That’s where the current account and the dollar come into play.
Lacking in saving and wanting to invest and grow, the US typically borrows surplus saving from abroad, and runs chronic current-account deficits in order to attract the foreign capital.
Thanks to the US dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” as the world’s dominant reserve currency, this borrowing is normally funded on extremely attractive terms, largely absent any interest-rate or exchange-rate concessions that might otherwise be needed to compensate foreign investors for risk.
That was then.
In COVID time, there is no conventional wisdom.
The US Congress has moved with uncharacteristic speed to provide relief amid a record-setting economic free-fall.
The Congressional Budget Office expects unprecedented federal budget deficits averaging 14% of GDP over 2020-21.
And, notwithstanding contentious political debate, additional fiscal measures are quite likely.
As a result, the net domestic saving rate should be pushed deep into negative territory.
This has happened only once before: during and immediately after the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when net national saving averaged -1.8% of national income from the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2010, while federal budget deficits averaged 10% of GDP.
In the COVID-19 era, the net national saving rate could well plunge as low as -5% to -10% over the next 2-3 years.
That means today’s saving-short US economy could well be headed for a significant partial liquidation of net saving.
With unprecedented pressure on domestic saving likely to magnify America’s need for surplus foreign capital, the current-account deficit should widen sharply.
Since 1982, this broad measure of the external balance has recorded deficits averaging 2.7% of GDP; looking ahead, the previous record deficit of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 could be eclipsed.
This raises one of the biggest questions of all: Will foreign investors demand concessions to provide the massive increment of foreign capital that America’s saving-short economy is about to require?
The answer depends critically on whether the US deserves to retain its exorbitant privilege.
That is not a new debate.
What is new is the COVID time warp: the verdict may be rendered sooner rather than later.
America is leading the charge into protectionism, deglobalization, and decoupling.
Its share of world foreign-exchange reserves has fallen from a little over 70% in 2000 to a little less than 60% today.
Its COVID-19 containment has been an abysmal failure.
And its history of systemic racism and police violence has sparked a transformative wave of civil unrest.
Against this background, especially when compared with other major economies, it seems reasonable to conclude that hyperextended saving and current-account imbalances will finally have actionable consequences for the dollar and/or US interest rates.
To the extent that the inflation response lags, and the Federal Reserve maintains its extraordinarily accommodative monetary-policy stance, the bulk of the concession should occur through the currency rather than interest rates.
Hence, I foresee a 35% drop in the broad dollar index over the next 2-3 years.
Shocking as that sounds, such a seemingly outsize drop in the dollar is not without historical precedent.
The dollar’s real effective exchange rate fell by 33% between 1970 and 1978, by 33% from 1985 to 1988, and by 28% over the 2002-11 interval.
COVID-19 may have spread from China, but the COVID currency shock looks like it will be made in America.

Exposing Climate Change Obstruction
STANFORD – Twenty-five years after the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on May 9, 1992, the world has yet to implement a treaty that effectively addresses global warming.
Now, following President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement, it is time to investigate more deeply the forces driving delay.
Throughout the 1990s, the American Petroleum Institute (API) – the largest oil and gas trade association and lobbying group in the US – repeatedly relied on economic models created by two economists, Paul Bernstein and W. David Montgomery, to argue that pro-climate policies would be devastatingly expensive.
API successfully lobbied for delaying measures to address climate change solutions, using Bernstein and Montgomery’s projections to claim that job losses and economic costs would outweigh environmental benefits.
These arguments were used in 1991, to torpedo the idea of carbon dioxide controls; in 1993, against the Clinton administration’s proposed BTU tax (an energy surcharge that would have taxed sources based on their heat and carbon content); in 1996, against the goals of the UN Conference of Parties in Geneva (COP2); in 1997, against the goals of the UN Conference of Parties in Kyoto (COP3); and in 1998, against the Kyoto Protocol’s implementation.
The API’s lobbying plan was repetitive.
It also worked.
The oil and gas industry portrayed the reports it commissioned from Bernstein, who once worked at the Hawaiian Electric Company, and Montgomery, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the US Department of Energy, as factual, independent, and products of genuine economic debate.
In the run-up to the 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, for example, the oil company Mobil claimed in an advertisement placed in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times that “the cost of limiting emissions could range from $200 to $580 per ton of carbon,” based on “a study just issued by Charles River Associates.” Mobil didn’t name who wrote the CRA report (Bernstein and Montgomery were the first two authors) or who funded it (API).
Mobil’s message was misleading, but was the analysis that Bernstein and Montgomery authored truly flawed?
Consider this: they ignored the negative costs of climate change, and suggested that clean energy would never be price competitive with fossil fuels, which is simply not true.
They assumed the result that they claimed to show.
The oil and gas industry was richly rewarded for abusing the public trust.
Americans eventually elected a president, George W. Bush, who bought the industry’s claims and pulled the US out of the Kyoto Protocol.
Sixteen years later, Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced, with equal sophistry, that the Paris climate agreement would devastate the US economy and cost America some 2.7 million jobs, mostly in the construction industry, by 2025.
That accounting, Trump said last month, was “according to the National Economic Research Associates.”
In case you’re wondering, the first two authors of the report Trump cited – just published in March – are Bernstein and Montgomery.
This time, they were hired by the American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington, DC-based think tank and lobbying group with a history of commissioning deeply flawed work used to challenge climate policy.
Throughout the 1990s, the oil and gas industry and its allies perfected the art of blocking America’s support for key global climate-change initiatives.
The maestros, it appears, are back, and their repertoire hasn’t changed.
It never had to.
In addition to commissioning studies claiming that climate policies would hurt the US economy, the industry also consistently claimed that efforts to address global warming would be uniquely harmful to the US, would not reduce the risks of climate change, and would prevent poverty alleviation.
All three of these additional arguments also appear in Trump’s announcement on the Paris accord.
When a tortoise is sitting on a post, you know it didn’t get there by itself.
The reappearance of the same four arguments developed a quarter-century ago by an industry that benefits from delaying climate policies – arguments used with great success precisely because their origin and true purpose were hidden from the public – looks a lot like the tortoise’s four wiggling feet.
If history rhymes, here’s what we may expect in the months ahead: industry-sponsored economic “studies,” flashy online content, think tank reports, and polished front groups posing as grassroots organizations.
These are time-tested components of the strategy used by the fossil fuel industry and others to block, obstruct, and control climate policy.
We must not let the industry continue to obstruct climate policy.
That means following the money that funds the pseudo-science of delay, and exposing the co-opted scholars who feed false images of debate to the public.
The same arguments – and people – used by the fossil fuel industry to block climate policies decades ago are back.
For the sake of humanity, we must not let them succeed again.

The Rise of Chinese “Sea Power”
In an age of missiles and terrorist threats, many people think that “sea power” is a word and concept from the past.
Not in China. Indeed, China is increasingly emphasizing its naval and maritime interests: economic development, territorial management, energy and food security as well as trade.
A navy sufficient to promote such activities is being rapidly developed and purchased from abroad (mostly from Russia, the EU when possible).
Many of China’s neighbors are alarmed.
The United States Defense Department views China’s goal as being to build a series of military and diplomatic strategic bases – a so-called “string of pearls” – along the major sea lanes from the South China Sea to the oil rich Middle East.
China seeks not only to secure its energy supplies, but to achieve broader security goals.
For example, the Gwadar military port, which China is constructing in southwest Pakistan, is strategically placed to guard the throat of the Persian Gulf, with electronic eavesdropping posts to monitor ships -- including war ships -- moving through the Strait of Hormuz and the Arabian Sea.
Similarly, China is building container port facilities at Chittagong in Bangladesh for its naval and merchant fleets, as well as more naval bases and electronic intelligence gathering facilities on islands owned by Myanmar in the Gulf of Bengal.
Indeed, China’s ties with Myanmar’s military dictators look set to turn into a de facto military alliance.
In nearby Thailand, China has invested $20 billion in a plan to build a canal across the Kra Isthmus to connect the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Siam, thereby providing an alternate oil import route that avoids the Strait of Malacca.
In the South China Sea, China is developing systems to allow large-scale deployment of naval and air force units by fortifying bases on Hai Nan Island and the southern Chinese coastal area.
On the Spratley and Paracel islands -- seized from Vietnam and the Philippines respectively -- China is building port facilities to moor large surface ships and runways large enough to handle long-range bombers.
In effect, China is in the process of building a group of literally unsinkable aircraft carriers in the middle of the South China Sea.
Why is China, usually considered a “continental power,” engaging in this maritime expansion?
China dominated Asia in terms of “sea power” until the seventeenth century. Indeed, during the Ming Dynasty (1368—1644), Admiral Zheng He’s “Great Navy” was the world’s most powerful.
But for the last three centuries, China has had no global maritime strategy, nor has it possessed – or sought to possess – naval forces capable of supporting such a strategy.
Ironically, China’s current maritime strategy has its roots in the US, the nation that China appears to perceive as its key strategic rival, namely in the “sea power” theory developed by Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan at the end of the nineteenth century.
In The Influence of Sea Power upon History, published in 1890, Mahan argued that maritime power and economic development were deeply intertwined. Only the ability to protect trade and project power by sea could assure the vitality of this nexus.
Mahan identified the conditions that determine “sea power”:
· geographical position and environment;
· territorial capacity, specifically coastline
· population;
· character of people attuned to maritime expeditions;
· character of government eager to ebrace “sea power”.
These conditions applied to the US of Mahan’s time, and they surely apply to China today.
China is already the world’s third largest trading nation and rapidly developing its port capacities to manage an ever-increasing volume of trade.
Its ship tonnage (excluding fleets that sail under flags of convenience) is the fourth largest in the world.
Rapid expansion of ship tonnage is part of China’s current Five-Year, and by 2010 its shipbuilding capabilities will likely rival those of Japan and Korea.
However, unlike the US and Britain in the past, China today must turn to overseas bases rather than colonization to enhance its “sea power” – hence its “string of pearls.”
Still, China is transforming its coastal navy into an ocean-going navy at a pace far quicker than most experts reckoned possible.
By 2010, China is expected to have 70 of the most modern surface vessels, several modern strategic nuclear submarines, and several tens of modernized attack submarines, exceeding the modern forces of both Taiwan’s navy and even Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force, at least in quantitative terms.
Moreover, China plans to improve and expand its capabilities for assault landing and joint logistical support, both of which used to be weak points.
This will provide China with necessary capabilities to invade, should China’s rulers wish, Japan’s most remote islands, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, as well as Taiwan.
If China’s naval growth continues at its current pace, it may have the world’s largest naval force by 2020.
All of Asia must wake up to the arrival of Chinese-style aggressive “sea power.”
Japan, in particular, must reformulate its national maritime strategy with this in mind.
Japan, America and other traditional maritime countries must also once again treat “sea power” in Asia as a key component of their ability to defend their own national interests.

Germany’s Five Election Unknowns
On September 18, Germany will hold an election that contains at least five unknowns.
If it were an equation, it would be impossible to solve.
Fortunately, politics is not mathematics – though, unfortunately, this means that there are no clear solutions.
Indeed, even in the opaque terms of contemporary politics, the German case is particularly vexing.
The first unknown is why the election is taking place at all.
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had another fifteen months to go before the end of the electoral term, and it seemed that he had no difficulty mobilizing his admittedly slender majority in parliament.
To be sure, the big issues that the Federal President listed when he dissolved the Bundestag are real.
The fiscal position is, by German standards, unacceptable, and public debt at current levels is contrary to the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact and a burden on future generations.
Demographic developments alone require major reforms of social policy.
Moreover, the institutions of the federal system do not permit decisions to be made either expeditiously or clearly.
None of this is new, nor will it be changed by an election.
So it is not obvious to many people why they are voting.
The second unknown concerns what, exactly, separates the major parties in this contest.
The Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (CDU) are both committed to the “social market economy,” to the essentials of corporatist economic management, to maintaining the entitlements of the welfare state, and to the EU and NATO.
True, the campaign has brought out nuances that may turn out to be important.
Schröder’s SPD uses the word “social” a little more emphatically than it did in the last seven years.
The opposition CDU leader, Angela Merkel, has linked its program to the ambitious ideas of an outsider, former Constitutional Court judge Paul Kirchhof, seeking a dramatic simplification of the tax system.
In international affairs, Merkel is more skeptical about European enlargement, notably to include Turkey, than Schröder.
Merkel, an East German by background, is also more cautious in her approach to Russia.
But these are nuances, not fundamental differences.
The third unknown is the performance of the Left Party, a new formation positioned to the left of the SPD and built on East Germany’s ex-communist PDS, with the addition of a significant number of dissident Social Democrats in the West who proclaim themselves to be defenders of the welfare state.
The Left Party is led by two talk show politicians, Gregor Gysi, the former PDS leader, and Oskar Lafontaine, the ex-leader of the SPD, who do not have much more in common than a record of political failure and a talent for populist speeches.
But this clearly appeals to those who feel that they have been neglected and forgotten.
The popular vote for this party – which could be 10% – may well determine what kind of coalition is formed after the election.
The fourth unknown is therefore what the next government will actually do.
It will clearly be a government without the new Left Party.
It will also be a government without the Greens, who continue to have a devoted, if limited, clientele, but are now regarded by many as a luxury that Germany can no longer afford.
This leaves two possibilities: a coalition between the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the liberal Free Democrats, or a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU.
The latter is what most Germans want; the former is what they are most likely to get.
But most people doubt whether it even makes a difference, and they are probably right.
There is a widespread desire for change, including a change of government, but there is an equally widespread belief that nothing momentous will happen.
This underscores the final, and deepest, unknown concerning the upcoming election: who will put a confused and directionless Germany back on a road to initiative and growth?
Who will make Germany an engine of Europe again rather than a gloomy passenger?
What Germany needs is, in fact, fairly clear.
It needs to accept that globalization is above all an opportunity, one that must be grasped by confident, innovative, and entrepreneurial people.
Germans need to understand again – as they did so well after 1945 – that their future lies in their own hands, as citizens, rather than in the power of some remote State.
Above all, Germany must appreciate that the changes it needs are improvements that would guarantee its future security.
Perhaps what it requires most is a touch of Margaret Thatcher’s policies of the 1980’s, combined with Tony Blair’s rhetoric of today.
But it remains to be seen whether, or when, that might be on offer.

John McCain and the Decline of America
BERKELEY – Back in 1981, America’s Republican Party gave up all belief that the government’s budget ought to be balanced.
The idea took hold that tax cuts should be undertaken all the time, at every opportunity, because reducing taxes supposedly raised revenue.
Irving Kristol, sometime editor of the magazine The Public Interest and one of the intellectual midwives of this idea, later wrote that he was interested not in whether it was true, but in whether it was useful.
Years later, he spoke of his “own rather cavalier attitude toward the budget deficit and other monetary or fiscal problems.
The task...was to create a new...conservative... Republican majority – so political effectiveness was the priority, not the accounting deficiencies of government...”
Now it has become clear that John McCain – who once criticized George W. Bush’s tax cuts as imprudent and refused to vote for them – has succumbed to this potion.
He appears to be proposing further tax cuts that promise to cost the United States Treasury some $300 billion a year, to “offset” them with cuts in earmarked spending accounted for at $3 billion a year, and somehow to balance the budget.
We know the consequences: McCain’s fiscal policy is likely to be standard Republican fiscal policy – and since 1981, standard Republican fiscal policy has increased the ratio of gross federal debt to GDP by nearly 2% per year.
By contrast, a typical post-WWII Democratic administration has reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio by more than 1% per year.
This is one of the issues at stake in this year’s presidential election.
Policies that ignore the level of government debt lead to the currency’s collapse, depression (due to the resulting disruption of the sectoral division of labor), and high inflation – perhaps hyperinflation.
Often, the guilty blame the economic catastrophe on the sinister manipulations of foreigners like the “gnomes of Zurich” or the IMF.
The US is far from that point.
But even in the shorter run – over the next two presidential terms, say – the costs of a high deficit and rapid debt growth would be substantial.
A growing debt-to-GDP ratio would, in the first instance, crowd out investment, as resources that would otherwise go to fund productive investment instead support private or public consumption.
Since 1981, the US has been lucky in that inflows of capital from abroad financed the growth of government debt.
At some point, this will stop, and increases in deficits will trigger capital flight from the US.
Suppose that over the next eight years larger deficits trigger neither extra capital inflows nor capital outflows, and suppose that a lower-investment America is a poorer America, with a gross social return on investment of 15% per year.
By 2016, America’s productive potential would be smaller by an amount that would reduce real GDP by 3.6% – $500 billion real dollars, or roughly $3,000 per worker.
In a poorer America, fewer businesses would find it worthwhile to entice secondary workers from families into the labor force, and perhaps 500,000 net jobs would disappear.
In getting from here to there over the next eight years, a higher-debt America would see productivity growth slow by perhaps a third of a percentage point per year.
Average unemployment would then have to rise in order to keep workers’ demands for real wage increases at a level warranted by productivity growth.
The gross correlations between productivity growth and average unemployment found in the 1970’s, 1980’s, 1990’s, and 2000’s would increase the economy’s natural rate of unemployment by about one-fifth of a percentage point, costing an additional 500,000 jobs.
And a higher-debt America is one in which savers and lenders would have a justified greater fear that the government would resort to inflation in order to repudiate part of its outstanding debt.
The Federal Reserve would then have to fight inflation – putting upward pressure on unemployment – in order to reassure savers and lenders of its willingness to guard price stability.
There are not even crude gross correlation-based estimates of the size of this effect, but economists believe that it is very real.
Would it cost a negligible number of jobs?
A quarter-million?
A million?
Add it all up, and you can reckon on an America that in 2016 that will be much poorer if McCain rather than Barack Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton is elected president.
Other countries that are counting on exporting to America would be affected by slower growth and lower employment in the US.
However, under McCain, the wedge between public spending and taxes would be larger, Americans would feel richer, and they would spend more at the expense of “posterity” eight years down the road.
Ronald Reagan might have approved.
After all, as he put it: “Why should I do anything for posterity?
What has posterity ever done for me?”
Or was that Groucho Marx?

New Year’s Resolutions for the Global Economy
STANFORD – Over the last year, global growth has been anemic – and the forecast is only slightly better for 2016.
Something must be done to boost incomes and expand opportunities for people everywhere.
Here are some economic resolutions that could bring good cheer in the new year and beyond.
Let us begin in Europe.
Despite the European Central Bank’s monetary accommodation, a sharp depreciation of the euro, and negative short-term interest rates, the European economy remains in the doldrums.
In 2016, Europe’s leaders must stop expecting monetary policy to solve their problems, and instead pursue faster, firmer resolutions to the myriad crises they face, from the intertwined growth, banking, currency, and governance crises to the escalating refugee crisis, which is threatening free movement across internal borders.
They must pursue supply-side fiscal, structural, labor-market, and regulatory reforms, with common-sense solutions for the struggling periphery economies’ fiscal crises and the stronger economies’ medium-term debt woes topping the agenda.
In Latin America, the situation is more varied.
After a decade of progress (with some exceptions, notably Venezuela), the region is facing serious challenges, stemming partly from a sharp decline in global commodity prices.
Indeed, plummeting oil prices helped to push the region’s largest economy, Brazil, into its worst recession in decades, while a major corruption scandal at Petrobras, the state oil company, has thrown the country’s politics into disarray, with President Dilma Rousseff now facing impeachment.
This makes the pursuit of economy-saving resolutions exceedingly difficult.
The new leftist finance minister will probably make things worse.
Political instability is undermining economic prospects elsewhere, too.
In Ecuador, where President Rafael Correa, who seems intent on imitating Venezuelan Chavismo, has eliminated term limits on his office, high inflation is a growing risk.
In Latin America’s second- and third-largest economies, however, new leadership offers reason for hope.
President Enrique Peña Nieto’s decision to open Mexico’s deep-water oil deposits to international energy companies will help the country overcome declining production, lagging technology, and corruption at Pemex, the national oil company.
Nieto also recognizes the imperative of improving Mexico’s education system, and thus is taking on the powerful teachers’ union.
In Argentina, newly elected President Mauricio Macri is nothing like his anti-business, anti-American predecessor Cristina Kirchner, who pillaged the central bank, channeling funds toward favored local governments, and even fudged national statistics to obscure skyrocketing inflation.
Among Macri’s resolutions are market-oriented reforms, and clearing the many economic land mines that Kirchner planted.
He is off to a good start, having freed the peso from its official peg, reduced taxes, and moved toward freer trade.
Venezuela also has reason for hope.
The opposition, having won a supermajority in parliament, defeating the ruling socialists for the first time in 17 years, should be able to limit the harm caused by the policies of President Nicolás Maduro, heir to Hugo Chávez.
But if opposition forces are to turn the economy around, they will need to win the presidency in 2019.
In Asia, all eyes are on China, the epicenter of a growth slowdown that has reverberated throughout the region (and beyond).
The remarkable growth spurt of the last three decades has degraded the natural environment considerably, produced vast excess capacity in basic industries like cement and steel, and left the banking system saddled with bad loans.
China’s government has committed to reform, but its efforts are lagging.
The rebalancing of its economy from exports to domestic demand remains a major challenge, not least because its consumers are slow to cooperate.
And the government maintains significant control over major companies, even some that are listed on public stock markets.
To engineer the soft landing that Asia needs, China’s leaders must redouble their reform efforts.
One key resolution should be to dispense state-owned companies’ profits directly to the population, to consume the proceeds or invest them elsewhere.
Japan, for its part, has sunk back into recession, despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s large and costly economic-revitalization strategy.
The Japanese, like many of their neighbors, hope that enactment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal – which would, among other things, lower tariffs on thousands of commodities and reduce non-tariff barriers – will provide a much-needed boost.
Africa has been a less visible success story in the last decade.
Despite the many difficulties the continent faces, foreign investment and trade (not aid) provide major opportunities for growth and development.
A resolution to break the scientifically illiterate opposition to genetically modified food would help boost agriculture and exports to Europe substantially.
In North America, Canada’s new center-left prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be tempted to expand government spending and regulation.
But he must not loosen the strings of the public purse too much.
Thanks to the collapse in oil prices, western Canada is in the early stages of a serious downturn.
Fortunately, there is room for Trudeau to meet the demands of his supporters, without wasteful spending.
To this end, he should press America’s next president to pursue the implementation of the TPP in a way that protects NAFTA; to maintain a sound monetary policy; and to reverse President Barack Obama’s veto of the Keystone Pipeline.
These steps would also be in the interest of the United States.
In fact, US efforts to promote free trade should go beyond the TPP to target the revitalization of the moribund Doha Round of multilateral trade liberalization.
Both monetary- and fiscal-policy normalization are critical.
And the US must capitalize on its expanded energy production, such as by enabling exports of oil and natural gas, to reduce its European allies’ dependence on Russian energy.
But perhaps America’s most important New Year’s resolution should be to return to global leadership – a role that has gradually eroded over the last decade, with devastating consequences.
That erosion, rooted in deep political fissures that are evident in the current presidential election campaign, is disturbing global economic, financial, and security arrangements that depend on American leadership.
The US may have a lot on its plate, but unless it leads effectively, the challenges it faces will only grow.

Politics and Corporate Money
CAMBRIDGE – A recent decision issued by the United States Supreme Court expanded the freedom of corporations to spend money on political campaigns and candidates – a freedom enjoyed by corporations in other countries around the world.
This raises well-known questions about democracy and private power, but another important question is often overlooked: who should decide for a publicly traded corporation whether to spend funds on politics, how much, and to what ends?
Under traditional corporate-law rules, the political-speech decisions of public companies are subject to the same rules as ordinary business decisions.
Consequently, such decisions can be made without input from ordinary shareholders or independent directors, and without detailed disclosure – all safeguards that corporate law establishes for other managerial decisions, such as those concerning executive compensation or related-party transactions.
In a recent article, however, Robert Jackson and I argue that political-speech decisions are fundamentally different from ordinary business decisions.
The interests of directors, executives, and dominant shareholders with respect to such decisions may often diverge significantly from those of public investors.
Consider a public corporation whose CEO or controlling shareholder supports a political movement to the country’s right or left and wishes to support it with corporate funds.
There is little reason to expect the political preferences of corporate insiders to mirror those of the public investors funding the company.
Furthermore, when such divergence of interest exists, using the corporation’s funds to support political causes that the corporation’s public investors do not favor – or even oppose – may well impose on them costs that exceed the monetary amounts spent.
To prevent this, lawmakers should adopt safeguards for political spending decisions that would limit the divergence of such decisions from shareholder interests.
For starters, it is important to require traded companies to provide detailed disclosure to public investors about the amounts and beneficiaries of any funds that the company spends, either directly or indirectly.
In expanding corporations’ rights to spend money on politics, the US Supreme Court relied on “the processes of corporate democracy” to ensure that such spending does not deviate from shareholder interests.
Clearly, however, such processes can have little effect if political spending is not transparent to public investors.
For such disclosure to be effective, it must include robust rules with respect to political spending via intermediaries.
In the US, for example, organizations that seek to speak for the business sector, or for specific industries, raise funds from corporations and spend more than $1 billion annually on efforts to influence politics and policymaking.
While the targets of these organizations’ spending are disclosed, there is no public disclosure that enables investors in any public corporation to know whether their corporation contributes to such organizations and how much.
Investors deserve to know.
Moreover, a public company’s political spending decisions should not be solely the province of management, as they often are.
Independent directors should have an important oversight role, as they do on other sensitive issues that may involve a divergence of interest between insiders and public investors.
And these directors should provide an annual report explaining their choices during the preceding year.
Lawmakers also should consider providing public investors with a say over political spending decisions.
In the United Kingdom, for example, public companies have been subject to such a requirement for more than a decade.
Shareholders of British companies must approve, by majority vote on a shareholder resolution, any political spending that exceeds £5,000.
Following the adoption of this legislation, political spending remained significant but fell somewhat below previous levels.
Shareholders may have different views from those of corporate insiders not only with respect to the amount of political spending, but also with respect to how that spending is targeted.
This problem can be addressed by permitting shareholders to adopt at the annual meeting binding resolutions concerning corporate political spending.
For example, shareholders could direct that the corporation may not spend funds for certain types of political purposes, or that it must follow certain principles in allocating whatever budget is authorized.
The mere existence of shareholder power to adopt such resolutions could well increase insiders’ incentives to target the corporation’s political spending in ways that are consistent with shareholder interests.
Legal rules allowing corporations to spend on politics are premised on the view that expression of corporations’ positions has a legitimate role in the political marketplace.
But a corporation’s wishes should not be automatically and necessarily equated with those of its management.
That is why we need new legislation to ensure that the use of corporate funds in politics does not stray from the interests of shareholders.

The Coming AI Spring
LONDON – Artificial intelligence (AI) is all around us, generating excitement about how it could increase prosperity and transform our lives in multiple ways.
Yet the technology is also likely to be disruptive.
Policymakers and businesses must therefore try to capture the full value of what AI has to offer, while avoiding the downside risks.
The idea of AI has been around for more than a half-century, and we have lived through previous periods of excitement followed by long stretches of disappointment – “AI winters” – when the tech didn’t live up to the hype.
But recent progress in AI algorithms and techniques, combined with a massive increase in computing power and an explosion in the amount of available data, has driven significant and tangible advances, promising to generate value for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.
Companies are already applying AI techniques in sales and marketing to make personalized product recommendations to individual customers.
And in manufacturing, AI is improving predictive maintenance by applying “deep learning” to high volumes of data from sensors.
By deploying algorithms to detect anomalies, firms can reduce the downtime of machinery and equipment, from jet engines to assembly lines.
Our research has highlighted hundreds of such business cases, which together have the potential to create between $3.5 trillion and $5.8 trillion in value per year.
AI also can contribute to economic growth by augmenting and substituting labor and capital inputs, spurring innovation, and boosting wealth creation and reinvestment.
(AI will also create some negative externalities and transition costs, but these will be outweighed by its benefits.)
We estimate that AI and analytics could add as much as $13 trillion to total output by 2030, increasing the annual rate of global GDP growth by more than one percentage point.
Furthermore, our research suggests that AI will have the greatest benefits if it focuses on innovation-led growth, and if its diffusion is accompanied by proactive management measures – in particular, retraining workers to give them the skills they will need to thrive in the new era.
As AI contributes to faster GDP growth, social welfare is also likely to increase.
We estimate that AI and related technologies could improve welfare by 0.5-1% per year between now and 2030.
That would be similar to the social impact of previous waves of technology adoption, including the information and communications technology revolution.
AI could help to improve many aspects of wellbeing, from job security and material living standards to education and environmental sustainability.
Its biggest positive contribution to welfare may come in the areas of health and longevity: AI-driven drug discovery is several times faster than that based on conventional research.
And AI-based traffic management can reduce the negative impact of air pollution on health by 3-15%.
One of the most exciting aspects of AI is its potential to help address a wide range of social challenges.
Although the technology is not a panacea, it could potentially help the world to meet all 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
AI applications that are currently being field-tested include efforts to assist with disaster-relief efforts, track smugglers (including human traffickers), and help blind people navigate their surroundings.
And an AI disease-detection system can identify skin cancer as well as or even better than professional dermatologists can.
For all its potential, however, AI also poses substantial challenges that need to be addressed.
The technologies themselves are still in the early stages of development, and more breakthroughs are needed to make them widely applicable.
And there are considerable problems of data availability, which in turn affect the quality of AI models.
One critical area of concern is the impact of AI and automation on work.
Overall, we expect that there will be enough work for everyone, and that more jobs will be gained than lost as a result of the new technologies.
But policymakers will need to manage significant transitions and challenges arising from AI adoption at national, regional, and local levels.
In the fastest automation-adoption scenario, up to 375 million workers worldwide will need to switch occupational categories by 2030, while some 75 million will be affected in a midpoint scenario.
The nature of almost all jobs will change, as people interact more closely with smart machines in the workplace.
That will require new skills, presenting companies and policymakers with the major challenge of training and retraining the workforce at scale.
And as demand for high-skill jobs grows, low-skill workers could be left behind, resulting in increased wage and income inequality.
The diffusion of AI will also raise difficult ethical questions.
Some of these will relate to the use and potential misuse of the technology in areas ranging from surveillance and military applications to social media and politics.
Algorithms and the data used to train them may introduce new biases, or perpetuate and institutionalize existing types.
Other critical concerns include data privacy and the use of personal information, cybersecurity, and “deep fakes” that could be used to manipulate election results or perpetrate large-scale fraud.
Despite these challenges, AI can generate tremendous value for us all, if policymakers and businesses act swiftly and smartly to capture its full benefits and mitigate the inevitable risks.
The long-awaited “AI spring” may finally be arriving, but we will need to be prepared to manage its onset with care.

Great Cities and Ghost Towns
HONG KONG – Many observers tend to regard the rise of unoccupied modern “ghost towns,” funded through risk-laden local-government financing vehicles (LGFVs), as symptoms of China’s coming collapse.
But this view underestimates the inevitability – indeed, the necessity – of such challenges on the path to development.
In 2012, the venture capitalist William Janeway argued that economic development is a three-player game involving the state, private entrepreneurial innovation, and financial capitalism, with inevitable cyclical overshoots that create the conditions for the next wave of invention and output growth.
The United States had ghost towns and local bank busts once it began investing in railways, mining, and industrialization in the mid-nineteenth century.
But it experienced no systemic crisis that spilled over its borders.
Without large-scale infrastructure investment, especially in transport, the productivity gains that enabled America’s emergence as an industrial power would have been impossible.
Though the process included significant creative destruction, rapid economic growth offset losses resulting from excess capacity.
Similarly, when viewed through the long lens of history, China’s ghost towns will prove to be potholes on the path to development.
China’s massive infrastructure investment, funded largely through LGFVs, will most likely be remembered for its critical contribution to the country’s economic modernization.
Of course, the translation of infrastructure investment into economic progress is not guaranteed.
The new infrastructure – together with on-the-job training that enables Chinese workers to manage it effectively – must boost the country’s productive capacity sufficiently to offset the value destruction from obsolete fixed assets and underemployment.
In this sense, China’s prospects are promising.
As it stands, the total value of infrastructure investment in China amounts to only about 240% of GDP, less than half of Japan’s 551% – and with a much younger population.
China’s capital stock remains below $10,000 per capita; that figure is above $90,000 in the US and more than $200,000 in Japan (at 2011 prices).
Moreover, roughly 1% of China’s population – about 12 million people – is migrating to cities each year.
Unrelenting demand for modern, innovative infrastructure that supports citizens’ livelihoods, improves energy efficiency, and minimizes pollution cannot simply be ignored – especially given urbanization’s central role in driving economic modernization and productivity gains.
Though LGFVs carry some intrinsic risks, stemming from relatively low levels of transparency and government supervision, they have been integral to China’s industrialization process so far.
Indeed, they emerged in the early 1990s to enable Shanghai and Guangdong to upgrade their infrastructure in preparation for their industrialization drive.
Both cities suffered from weak technical and institutional capacity and little foreign exchange or domestic credit.
By working with the World Bank and the China Development Bank (CDB), Shanghai and Guangdong created an innovative institutional structure to facilitate the coordination of stakeholders to deliver specific infrastructure projects, employing the legal and accounting tools of modern corporations.
In other words, the LGFV is, at its core, a vehicle for local modernization.
This institutional innovation enabled the reconstruction of hundreds of Chinese cities, connected by airports, highways, high-speed rail, and advanced telecommunication systems.
Supported by these structures and linkages, one-third of Chinese cities have attained per capita GDP of more than $10,000.
Moreover, the original LGFVs were not subject to maturity mismatches, because they were funded through long-term CDB loans, with local governments using the fees and taxes they accrued from the completed infrastructure to cover operating costs and service their debt.
In this way, LGFVs also helped to create the network linking local markets to global value chains.
But, as is often the case, success led to excess.
Massive government stimulus in the wake of the global financial crisis spurred local governments to take loans from Chinese banks to realize dream infrastructure projects, with remote cities attempting to imitate urban showcases like Shanghai or Shenzhen.
In a sense, this was a positive development.
After all, leveling the infrastructure gap enlarges the range of options from which people and companies can choose when deciding where to live or establish factories and offices.
But the infrastructure boom was underpinned by the belief that local governments would always have access to easy credit, cheap land, and rising demand.
When the market tightened in 2011, many projects’ prospects diminished, spurring LGFVs to seek credit in the shadow banking sector, which has caused their borrowing costs to rise and introduced new market-based challenges to the reform process.
Nonetheless, because China is a net lender to the world, LGFV debt has no global systemic implications.
While China’s outstanding local-government debt totaled CN¥29 trillion ($4.7 trillion) at the end of 2011, its land and fixed assets are worth some CN¥90 trillion, meaning that even if asset values were written down by half, local governments would remain solvent.
This leaves only the issue of debt servicing.
To resolve it, the government has announced fiscal reforms to split revenues between central and local governments and enable local governments to issue long-term municipal bonds.
China’s ghost towns and local-government debts are not harbingers of doom.
They are bumps on the road to a developed economy, in which excesses will have to be resolved by the state or the market.
In fact, overcoming these challenges will make for a more resilient economy in the long run.

Will Crypto Survive?
SAN FRANCISCO – The epic collapse of wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion crypto empire, FTX, looks set to go down as one of the great financial debacles of all time.
With a storyline full of celebrities, politicians, sex, and drugs, the future looks bright for producers of feature films and documentaries.
But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, rumors of the death of crypto itself have been much exaggerated.
True, the loss of confidence in “exchanges” such as FTX – essentially crypto financial intermediaries – almost surely means a sustained steep drop in prices for the underlying assets.
The vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are done “off-chain” in exchanges, not in the Bitcoin blockchain itself.
These financial intermediaries are vastly more convenient, require much less sophistication to use, and do not waste nearly so much energy.
The emergence of exchanges was a major factor fueling cryptocurrencies’ price growth, and if regulators come down hard on them, the price of the underlying tokens will fall.
Accordingly, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have plummeted.
But a price adjustment alone is not the end of the world.
The pertinent question is whether crypto lobbyists will be able to contain the damage.
Until now, their money has been speaking volumes; Bankman-Fried reportedly gave $40 million to support the Democrats in the United States, and his FTX colleague Ryan Salame reportedly gave $23 million to Republicans.
Such largesse surely helped persuade regulators around the world to follow a wait-and-see approach to crypto regulation, rather than be perceived to be stifling innovation.
Well, they waited, and with the FTX crash, we must hope that they saw.
But what will they conclude?
The most likely path is to improve regulation of the centralized exchanges – the firms that help individuals store and trade cryptocurrencies “off chain.”
The fact that a multi-billion-dollar financial intermediary was not subject to normal record-keeping requirements is stupefying, no matter what one thinks about the future of crypto.
Of course, firms would face compliance costs, but effective regulation could restore confidence, benefiting firms aiming to operate honestly, which are surely the majority, at least if one weights these exchanges by size.
Greater confidence in the remaining exchanges could even lead to higher crypto prices, though much would depend on the extent to which regulatory demands, particularly on individual identities, ultimately undermined demand.
After all, the major transactions currently conducted with crypto may be remittances from rich countries to developing economies and emerging markets, and capital flight in the other direction.
In both cases, the parties’ desire to avoid exchange controls and taxes implies a premium on anonymity.
On the other hand, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain and one of the crypto industry’s most influential thinkers, has argued that the real lesson of FTX’s collapse is that crypto needs to return to its decentralized roots.
Centralized exchanges such as FTX make holding and trading cryptocurrencies much more convenient, but at the expense of opening the door to managerial corruption, just as in any conventional financial firm.
Decentralization can mean greater vulnerability to attack, but so far the largest cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have proven resilient.
The problem with having only decentralized exchanges is their inefficiency compared to, say, Visa and Mastercard, or normal bank transactions in advanced economies.
Centralized exchanges like FTX democratized the crypto domain, allowing ordinary people without technical skill to invest and conduct transactions.
It is certainly possible that ways to duplicate the speed and cost advantages of centralized exchanges eventually will be found.
But this seems unlikely in the foreseeable future, making it hard to see why anyone not engaged in tax and regulatory evasion (not to mention crime) would use crypto, a point I have long emphasized.
Perhaps regulators should push toward decentralized equilibrium by requiring that exchanges know the identity of anyone with whom they transact, including on the blockchain.
Although this may sound innocent, it would make it rather difficult to trade on the anonymous blockchain on behalf of an exchange’s customers.
True, there are alternatives involving “chain analysis,” whereby transactions in and out of a Bitcoin wallet (account) can be algorithmically examined, allowing the underlying identity to be revealed in some cases.
But if this approach was always enough, and all semblance of anonymity could always be obliterated, it is hard to see how crypto could compete with more efficient financial intermediation options.
Finally, rather than simply banning crypto intermediaries, many countries may ultimately try to ban all crypto transactions, as China and a handful of developing economies have already done.
Making it illegal to transact in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other crypto would not stop everyone, but it would certainly constrain the system.
Just because China was among the first does not make the strategy wrong, especially if one suspects that the main transactions relate to tax evasion and crime, akin to large denomination paper currency notes like the $100 bill.
Eventually, many other countries are likely to follow China’s lead.
But it is unlikely that the most important player, the US, with its weak and fragmented crypto regulation, will undertake a bold strategy anytime soon.
FTX may be the biggest scandal in crypto so far; sadly, it is unlikely to be the last.

The Weary Titan
PARIS – The unfolding “currency war,” which is likely to dominate discussions at the upcoming G-20 summit in Seoul, must be assessed against the backdrop of the new landscape of power – a landscape that has been transformed, in just two years, by the first crisis of the globalized economy.
The economic consequences of the crisis have left a number of developed countries in a severe slump and scrambling to bring about a healthy recovery.
By contrast, the emerging-market countries, after a short slide, have managed to re-ignite their growth engines and are sailing full-speed ahead, racking up impressive growth rates.
There have been financial and monetary consequences as well.
Although no currency is as of yet qualified to replace the dollar as the world’s reserve and transaction currency, this “exorbitant privilege,” as Charles de Gaulle put it, has come under stealthy attack.
In March 2010, the “ASEAN + 3” grouping, which includes China, Japan, and South Korea, established a reserve fund of $120 billion, under the so-called “Chiang Mai Initiative.”
This time, unlike in 1997, the United States did not even attempt to torpedo this embryonic “Asian Monetary Fund.”
After coping well initially, Europe entered choppy waters when confronted with the prospect of Greece defaulting on its public debt.
The “crisis within the crisis” exposed the eurozone’s weak governance and revived doubts about the viability of a monetary union with large competitiveness gaps between its members.
The crisis has also intensified political problems.
Japan, arguably the hardest hit by the global recession, faces an increasingly severe moral, demographic, and governance crisis, highlighted by its recent loss, to China, of its status as the world’s second largest economy.
In Europe, bickering between leaders revealed the lack of solidarity underpinning European ideals and gave full view to the persistence of national egoisms against which the European project had managed to define itself since the end of World War II.
Finally, the crisis has shattered the ideological dominance of the West.
In previous decades, financial crises often originated in emerging economies, sanctimoniously patronized by the “virtuous” West and its institutions.
This time, powered by the dogma of market resilience and self-correction, the storm formed at the heart of the world economy, the US.
The natural instinct of many is still, as in the past, to look at the American economy, towering over the rest of the world with its $14 trillion GDP, as the engine of global recovery.
Indeed, the US retains an edge, owing to its capacity for innovation, its technological advances, its entrepreneurial spirit, and its indefatigable optimism.
But doubts are growing.
The economic powerhouse that for decades confidently provided hegemonic stability to the global economy seems at pains to continue doing so.
An increasingly uncompetitive civilian industry, the burden of military commitments overseas, wage stagnation: all signal that the American titan may be wearying.
The most worrisome sign, though, is America’s rising public debt – now at 95% of GDP and, even according to the official General Accounting Office’s conservative estimate, set to soar to $18.4 trillion by 2018.
When the implied liabilities of the Social Security and Medicare systems are added on, an unprecedented level of peacetime debt confronts the US.
The paradox here is that, as its hegemonic power fades, America must rely increasingly on foreign creditors, above all China, to stay afloat.
Unfortunately, the proverbial Washington political gridlock leaves little hope for fixing the problem, adding to the impression of a giant with clay feet.
The alternative to a world in which America guarantees global prosperity and stability within a liberal order is one of increasing conflict, replete with mercantilism, protectionism, and currency wars.
Only a multilateral settlement among all major actors can ensure a smoothly working global order – a cause advanced in late 2008, when the technical G-20 forum was quickly upgraded to a full summit in charge of global governance.
Encompassing all big emerging economies, this appeared to be the most effective way to muster the legitimacy denied to the G-7.
But can the G-20 deliver on its promise?
As the chaos at the climate-change conference in Copenhagen last December amply demonstrated, both the number of members around the table and the differences between them – even within the group of emerging countries – do not bode well for the future.
The present “currency war” is but another sign of that disorder.
Of course, due to its sheer military might and numerous alliances, the US will remain on top for the foreseeable future.
Indeed, while hubris and the crisis have seriously undermined the world’s “hyperpower,” no multipolar order has emerged to follow America’s “unipolar moment.”
America has become the “default power”, because China, the most likely challenger, is, by its own admission, a long way from economic or military parity with the US.
But military dominance alone is unable to confer authority, as the Afghan quagmire reminds us every day.
Having succeeded in integrating the West through prosperity and security following WWII, America must begin to craft a new global leadership structure.
The task is even more daunting than in the years after 1945, for today a number of fiercely independent-minded, aspiring world powers must be herded into the global order.
As the main architect of globalization, which awakened awareness worldwide of the need for global public goods, the US must, even in its weariness, summon its creative resources.

Pandemics and Progress
AMMAN – Humanity has survived many pandemics throughout history.
In many cases, we learned lessons that helped to spur subsequent progress.
For example, the kingdoms and states of Central and Western Europe abolished serfdom once it became clear in the aftermath of devastating pestilence that dependency and servitude jeopardized leaders’ hold on power.
Similarly, the Spanish Flu pandemic that killed more than 50 million people in 1918-19 highlighted the vulnerability of entire countries in the absence of widespread access to basic health care.
That episode spurred governments to start building the public-health systems that improved life so much in the twentieth century.
More often than not, humanity has banded together in the face of all kinds of threats.
Today, the COVID-19 pandemic and its many ramifications threaten to push our social, political, and economic structures to the breaking point.
If the past is prologue, then our survival and welfare demand that we change.
The combination of disease, recession, and fear can rapidly overwhelm states and societies.
Each coming day will bring increasing challenges that can be met only by caring for the sick, minimizing the impact of shutdowns on lives and livelihoods, securing the delivery of adequate water, food, and energy supplies, and racing to find a cure for the virus.
As in any asymmetric conflict, success depends on resilience.
To contain the economic and sociopolitical fallout from the crisis, policymakers should focus on preserving human dignity and welfare as the bedrock of national and international security.
In much of the world, the most vulnerable members of society are those on the front lines of the crisis: not just doctors, nurses, care-givers, and pharmacists, but also sanitation workers, farmers, supermarket cashiers, and truck drivers.
All are displaying the courage, sacrifice, and dedication that will see us through the next 12-18 months of lockdowns.
But in the absence of state support, what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people who have already been laid off, and the millions more who face looming hardship as unemployment continues to rise?
As the calls for social distancing grow louder and more incessant, we must remember our humanitarian duty to one another.
After all, security, far from being individual, is collective and global.
Indeed, the logic of mutually assured survival does not allow for gray areas.
In the end, successful conflict resolution always finds a way to transcend political beliefs, nationality, ethnicity, gender, and religion.
Likewise, beating back this pandemic will require that our commitment to life be truly universal.
The world has reliable brokers that can help to manage this and other crises, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières.
They and other similarly trusted organizations must take the lead in developing a public platform of health facts so that everyone understands both the scale of the challenge and the changes we must make in order to meet it.
And those who cry hoax need to be exposed as the callous cynics that they are.
Moreover, the people who have been attacked the most in recent years – migrants and refugees – must be an integral part of national efforts to halt the spread of COVID-19.
The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia says that 55 million people in the region require some sort of humanitarian assistance, and that displaced women and girls are especially vulnerable in a pandemic.
So, the challenge to both public health and our shared humanity is vast.
Fortunately, the multilateral system, although damaged by nationalist attacks in recent years, still has the capacity to face up to this existential crisis.
And although human solidarity initially was significantly weakened as the COVID-19 virus spread from China, it is now being bolstered by Chinese assistance to Italy’s people and government in their time of need.
The current crisis is equally a crisis of globalization, which, while it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in recent decades, has also undermined the foundations of sustainability.
A better globalization will require nothing less than extending the ethic of human solidarity beyond the contours of our immediate response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Real success will lie not in taming a pathogen, but in rediscovering and institutionalizing the true value of compassion, respect, and generosity in the weeks and months ahead.

Russia and America at the Oscars
NEW YORK – Oscar has spoken.
Neither Leviathan, the Russian film nominated for the best Foreign Language Film, nor American Sniper, nominated for Best Picture, won.
Yet both, in a way, are the most representative films of the year, as each captures the essence of why Russia and the United States now seem doomed to wage a new Cold War.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Leviathan faced an uphill public-relations battle.
But Leviathan's bleak portrait of contemporary Russian life actually confirms many of the reasons why Americans have been largely dubious about Russia's ability to reform following communism's collapse.
That doubt has been reflected in popular culture.
Since 1991, Hollywood has documented American mistrust of post-Soviet Russia in a series of films – for example, The Saint, Air Force One, The Golden Compass of 2006, Salt, and The November Man.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's thuggish foreign policy has proved these Russophobes right, so nominating Leviathan, the superb biopsy of his regime, seemed only right.
And, though Oscar did not anoint Leviathan, the film deserves all of the accolades it has received.
Directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev in an eerie style that one might call the “realism of despair," the film is both epic and deeply nuanced.
The title harks back to the book of Job and recalls Herman Melville's Moby Dick.
Set in a small town on the Barents Sea, Leviathan shows that there is no escape, not even in the Arctic, from the Moscow-centric state and its hypocritical doppelganger, the Orthodox Church.
The giant skeleton of a whale – possibly Leviathan itself – is beached on the shoreline, along with the carcasses of old boats, beneath a severe gray sky that frames a human landscape of political abuse, adultery, lawlessness, and the cynicism of all-powerful priests.
The story, akin to Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ambitious 1962 masterpiece One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, steadily indicts the corruption of state power – a power ever-willing to kill and to align itself with an even more corrupt power, the Orthodox Church.
Like communism, which once promised absolution for the worst crimes in exchange for loyalty, Russia's current state religion allows, even encourages, misdeeds – including murder – so long as one is loyal to God.
Nikolai, Leviathan's hotheaded main character, sees his life consumed by the fight to save his seashore property from the town's mayor. “I'll kill him if he builds a palace here," shouts Nikolai, in a reference to current Russian leaders' proclivity for erecting garish monuments to their personal splendor: Putin's Italianate palace on the Black sea, for example, allegedly cost more than $1 billion.
At the end of his struggle, Nikolai's life is ruined.
His wife is killed, and he stands accused of murdering her for an affair she briefly had with his friend.
At the end, we learn that Nikolai was persecuted to make room not for the mayor's palace, but for a cathedral.
Even the Russian clichés – tragedy stemming from overweening power, vodka, swearing, shooting, and shouting – only strengthen the film's extraordinary depiction of the local effects of distant and devastating forces.
This is Russian politics at its most debased.
In Stalin's time, the masterpieces of, say, Boris Pasternak or Dmitri Shostakovich were entrusted to give artistic voice to a silenced civil society.
So it is ironic that Leviathan was partly financed by Russia's culture ministry – and telling that the Russian authorities had no interest in its winning at the Oscars.
Indeed, Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky recently criticized the film for its darkness and pessimism.
American Sniper, directed by Clint Eastwood, reflects US mores as much as Leviathan reflects the current Russian Zeitgeist.
But, where Leviathan examines Putin's Russia with the unflinching eye of a surgeon, American Sniper merely trumpets supposed national values with no consideration of their application around the world.
During four tours in Iraq as a soldier/missionary, a stand-up Texan, Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) becomes known as Legend, a killer with a savior complex. American Sniper, loosely based on Kyle's memoir, touts the frontier mentality – a neo-cowboy movie made by a former cowboy-movie star.
Just as Leviathan shows a Russia caught in the throes of a political nightmare, American Sniper shows a country trapped by its heroic mythology – defined in countless Western movies – of rugged individualism at home and defense of freedom and order abroad.
But the world has changed, and many no longer view America's global role as an expression of its unique innocence and goodness.
Given everything we have learned about the Iraq War – false claims about weapons of mass destruction, nonexistent links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, and so on – Eastwood's film comes across as a work of marketing, not reflection and contemplation.
Eastwood has merely updated his earlier films – think The Outlaw Josey Wales or Pale Rider – with their unwavering conviction that America's god of righteousness must prevail.
In short, American Sniper fails where Leviathan succeeds.
George Orwell neatly summarized why: “All propaganda is a lie even when it's telling the truth."

Milosevic and Hussein: Trial by Farce
Trials of war criminals were once serious business.
Recall the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg.
Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials.
Nowadays, legal proceedings against the world's most wicked leaders have become farce.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba’athist cronies offers an ongoing series of embarrassments.
The defendants try one antic after another, and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible except “mooning” the judge.
It is hard to expect an outcome that will appear legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic’s trial morphed into a funeral after four boring years of testimony and a sunken cost of more than $200 million.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have dickered for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures to trial.
The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were doomed to being killed in popular revolts or to being tried for their crimes – that is, if they did not die in power.
Who can be proud that Romania’s last Communist boss, Nicolai Ceaucescu, and his wife were shot without even the semblance of a fair trial?
The formal trappings of a real court always seem better than instant justice, even if the end result is also death.
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.
A nation could put its own former leaders on trial, as the Argentines did in the 1980’s with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 fellow citizens.
At the international level, the Nuremberg model remains available to generate further trials, though under the dubious conditions that victorious powers sometimes impose liability for crimes, such as “crimes against humanity” that were are not properly defined at the time they are committed.
There was a time when we could see the advantages of both national and international trials.
Home grown trials enabled the local community to work out its grief by participating closely in the process.
As judges and juries, the defendant’s compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the assessment of guilt because they appreciated the tough conditions under which a deposed dictator made his decisions.
Argentina’s trial of the generals was a successful ritual in the painstaking transition from military junta to democracy, but the experience ended with weeping self-doubt.
Even after conviction, the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president.
Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of those trials of 20 years ago.
At the international level, the UN Security Council’s decision to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was also greeted with great confidence.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
But then the judges had the misfortune of realizing their fondest dream – trying in their court the arch-villain Slobodan Milosevic.
It is not clear how the Serbs would have handled Milosevic in a local trial.
A lot would have depended on the political party that controlled the court.
At the international level, the fear was not of too much politics but of too much law.
Milosevic’s trial had to be more than fair, it had to be an emblem of UN Justice.
Thus Milosevic was allowed to defend himself – a huge mistake in terms of the trial’s length and efficiency.
There was no limit on the number of witnesses the prosecution called to testify about the same gruesome story of Serbian aggression and brutality.
It will take many months to determine what went wrong and why the trial lasted a scandalous four years.
My hunch is that the court’s well-meaning officials were too influenced by the South African Peace and Reconciliation Commission, a model touted in law schools as the desired alternative to retributive justice.
In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
Every victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened.
In the case of massacres endured in the twentieth century, such storytelling can last decades.
Encouraging victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to filibuster the proceedings by touting his merits as a political leader amounts to a formula for infinite delay.
One lesson we have learned from both the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that one should not put men or women on trial in order to terminate their charismatic appeal.
They will turn the trial around – particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves – and use the courtroom to vindicate their careers.
Tyrants should be tried only after they are clearly defeated.
Ironically, it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were staffed by the representatives of the victorious powers.
They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess, and their henchmen that the Allies were in charge, that the Nazis were irreversibly defeated.
Punishing the guilty, rather than shaping the way history would be written, was always the clear objective of the trial.
The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the “i”s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial.
The resulting hesitancy of those in charge gave rise to procedures – both international and national – that facilitated fantasies of vindication and return.
In the case of Hussein, that fantasy may yet become real.

Will Sudan Break Through to Democracy?
KHARTOUM – On September 8, Sudan’s first civilian cabinet in 30 years was sworn in.
Led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and comprising technocrats, it will oversee a power-sharing arrangement brokered between the country’s military and pro-democracy movement last month.
The question now is whether factions within the military, the Islamic opposition, or various rebel groups will end up preventing the transition to democracy under elections planned for 2022.
Aside from Tunisia, Sudan is the only Arab country making genuine progress toward democracy at the moment.
The Sudanese Revolution that began in December 2018 will be remembered for its participants’ remarkable perseverance, courage, and organization.
Having learned from the Egyptian fiasco – which ended with a return to even harsher despotism – Sudan’s democracy movement wanted the army to give up power, and sufficient time to organize the transition.
Under the power-sharing arrangement, it had to compromise on its first goal, and the military will rule for the first phase of the transition, to be followed by a civilian government.
Since the formation of the new cabinet, the mood in the capital, Khartoum, has been ebullient.
Ministers are unveiling new policy proposals, foreign diplomats are arriving, TV coverage of soccer has been replaced by political talk shows, talks with rebels have begun, and the Islamist parties that formed a key pillar of the previous regime have been banned and driven underground.
As civil-society groups and the generals vie for popular support, even the infamous Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is trying to improve its image.
There are three major items on the medium-term agenda.
First, under the transitional constitution, the government must negotiate regional peace agreements within the next six months.
That will lead to a more democratic and liberal national order.
But the new leadership also must prepare for the additional political, institutional, and financial commitments that each regional agreement will produce.
Second, the government must reform the security sector.
In addition to establishing a professional and inclusive national army and reducing the power of the intelligence service, it needs to rein in the RSF, integrate the rebel forces, and work toward eventual budget cuts.
Finally, the government must revive the economy, which is in urgent need of external support.
Because the country’s debt overhang will take a year or two to resolve, funds from the Gulf Cooperation Council will play a central role in the first phase of the transition.
Moreover, the government needs to implement structural reforms to improve public services and strengthen the private sector.
Sudan’s economic problems are daunting.
The country has reverted to near-autarky.
Imports and exports amount to just 10% and 6% of GDP, respectively.
Public and private institutions have withered away as state-backed strongmen have financed militias and other clients through revenues raised from illicit activities (gold mines, contraband, and the like).
According to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, credit to the private sector and total investment both stand at a paltry 8% of GDP.
By 2018, public expenditures had fallen to 9% of GDP, tax revenues to 8% of GDP, and civil-service wages to just 3% of GDP.
To achieve economic growth, the government must reconstruct monopolized domestic markets and shift public spending away from patronage.
In setting priorities, the new cabinet will have to be mindful of its scarce political capital.
The most urgently needed reforms will also be the most contentious, because they will run counter to the military’s interests.
Political constraints will inevitably impede economic growth.
But as long as the overall pie is expanding, Sudan will make progress.
In the early phase, improved security and reduced political uncertainty will encourage economic activity by lowering transaction costs.
That should result in some catch-up growth, given pent-up demand and a capital stock in need of replenishment.
In fact, many new opportunities are already opening up.
Sudanese entrepreneurs have access to a prosperous diaspora, and now that budget priorities are poised to shift, social movements can organize to demand new public services.
Similarly, international donors are being encouraged to shift their focus from humanitarian aid to social and economic development.
Reprising Egypt’s 2016 economic program, one early policy package under consideration would include an exchange-rate devaluation to attract remittances, and parallel measures to reduce contraband and increase tax revenues.
At that point, a social-insurance program could be introduced to replace the inefficient, unequal subsidies regime.
Should these policies succeed in stabilizing the economy, deeper problems will become easier to solve.
Increased revenues will make it possible to fund both the civil service and the military.
And a more open, interconnected, and competitive national market will work against local monopolies.
The stakes are high for both Sudan and the wider region, which is why the United Nations and other parts of the international community are mobilizing.
Outside political pressure has pushed the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to support a democratic resolution.
And a reinvigorated Friends of Sudan Group is committed to facilitating political and financial cooperation, and preventing proxy warfare like that which has ravaged Libya, Syria, and Yemen.
The next priority is to convince the United States to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, so that the country can access international banking channels and accelerate its debt-reduction process.
Sudan has a unique opportunity to adopt representative democracy.
The transitional government now hopes to create a virtuous cycle of progress and reform, but there will inevitably be bumps in the road.
The country needs all the help it can get, but success ultimately will hinge on the perseverance of the democracy movement.
In light of its recent history, that means there is cause for hope.

The Politics of Revolutionary Surprise
DURHAM – In setting himself ablaze following a humiliating encounter with the police, the university-educated Tunisian vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi triggered a wave of protests across the Arab world.
Several Arab dictators who had held power for decades have already been ousted or forced to announce that they will retire.
But protesters in Cairo, Tunis, and Sana want much more.
They also seek efficient governance, economic reforms to stimulate growth, the ouster of collaborators, democratic rights, freedom of religion (and perhaps also from religion) – in short, a comprehensive social transformation.
Everywhere, incumbent regimes have mounted resistance.
The unforgettable scene of camel- and horse-riding Mubarak supporters beating tech-savvy Egyptian protesters signals that the old order will not yield without a fight.
The revolts themselves caught seasoned observers, even Arab leaders, off guard.
Had the United States known what lay ahead, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would not have remarked, after demonstrations broke out in Egypt, that the Egyptian government was “stable.”
Arab leaders now showering their key constituencies with pay raises and food subsidies would have done so earlier, thus avoiding the impression of vulnerability.
Longtime regime opponents, too, were caught off guard.
For days after Egypt erupted, the Muslim Brotherhood did not know how to react, making it seem out of touch with the “Arab street.”
For decades, most Arabs, however unhappy, kept their political grievances private, for fear of persecution if they turned against their leaders publicly.
Through private discussions with trusted friends, everyone sensed that discontent was common, yet no one knew, or could know, the extent of it.
Even harder to gauge was what it would take for the disaffected to say “enough is enough” and begin challenging their regime openly, defiantly, and in concert.
If a sufficient number of Arabs reached that threshold at the right time, the long-docile Arab street would explode in anger, with each group of new protesters encouraging more to join in, giving people elsewhere in the Arab world the courage to initiate protests of their own.
That much was understood widely by entrenched Arab dictators, who saw to it that their intelligence and security corps extinguished any flame before it could spread.
History will record that the match Bouazizi lit on December 17, 2010, became the fortuitous spark that ignited an Arab prairie fire.
The fire spread so fast that by the time Arab leaders understood what it would consume, it was beyond anyone’s control, and in more than one country.
The overthrown Tunisian dictator must now regret that his security forces did not arrest Bouazizi and lock him up, rather than allow his public self-immolation.
As it turned out, by the time the seriousness of the rebellion became clear, fear was already changing sides even within the halls of Tunisian power.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s aides had started worrying more about being caught on the wrong side of Tunisian history than about facing the wrath of their beleaguered boss.
Fissures within the Egyptian regime suggest that in Hosni Mubarak’s entourage, too, fear is in flux.
The mechanisms underlying this political unpredictability are not unique to the Arab world.
Unforeseen uprisings are possible wherever repression keeps people from expressing their political preferences openly.
In 1989, the fall of repressive East European regimes in quick succession stunned the world, including dissidents who had long recognized communism’s vulnerabilities.
Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “island of stability.” A month before the Russian Revolution of February 1917, Lenin predicted that his country’s great explosion lay in the distant future.
All of these cases involved the mushrooming of public protest by long-quiescent constituencies with no prior record of coordinated action.
The aftermath of an unanticipated revolution will itself present surprises.
In Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, no one knows where power will lie in the months to come.
As in Iran in 1979, demonstrators united in opposition to the old regime have wildly differing goals.
Their biggest demands – secure jobs, faster growth, low food prices – are not necessarily compatible, and they may require policies that inflict pain.
Divisions within the opposition movements are thus inevitable.
If the Arab societies now in turmoil had democratic traditions, they could be expected to find compromises peacefully, through open and honest debate.
Alas, given their histories of autocratic rule, giant leaps forward to full-blown democracy are unlikely.
Though steps toward democracy are possible, when the euphoria of the moment passes, political contenders will realize that, if only in self-defense, they must restrict their opponents’ freedoms.
Adding to the complexity of the situation are the Islamists, who have so far kept a low profile.
They themselves are divided, with preferences ranging from Sharia rule in one form or another to a “Turkish model” involving mild Islamism capable of achieving mass support through the ballot box.
Several things are certain.
The Arab street has changed the calculus of fear not only in the countries that have witnessed major protests, but also in the rest of the Arab world, where rulers are on notice that discontent need not remain submerged forever.
Arab leaders old and new will implement policies designed to alleviate popular dissatisfaction.
They will consider both easing repression, in order to gain sympathy, and tightening it, in order to prevent uncontrollable protests. But, whatever they do, they – and the rest of the world – must now expect surprises.

A More Dangerous Globalism
“Britain first,” say the advocates of Brexit. “France first,” crows Marine Le Pen and her National Front.
“Russia first,” proclaims Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. With so much emphasis on national sovereignty nowadays, globalization appears doomed.
It’s not.
The struggle playing out today is not one of globalism versus anti-globalism. Rather, the world is poised between two models of integration: one is multilateral and internationalist; the other is bilateral and imperialist.
Throughout the modern age, the world has seesawed between them.
Since 1945, internationalists have had the upper hand.
They advocate cooperation and multilateral institutions to promote global public goods like peace, security, financial stability, and environmental sustainability.
Theirs is a model that constrains national sovereignty by binding states to shared norms, conventions, and treaties.
The year 2016 tipped the scales toward bilateralists, who regard national sovereignty as an end in itself.
The fewer external constraints, the better: peace and security result from a balance of great powers.
Theirs is a model that favors the strong and punishes the weak, and that rewards competitors at the expense of cooperators.
For most of the nineteenth century, integration was a hybrid of internationalism and imperialism.
Free trade became gospel, mass migration was welcomed, and countries embraced new global norms, like the First Geneva Convention, concluded in 1864 to cover the treatment of the sick and wounded on the battlefield.
Globalizers could also be bullies: the 1842 Treaty of Nanking between Britain and China subordinated the Middle Kingdom to the West.
And bilateral imperialism’s ugliest face was reflected in Europeans’ carve-up of Africa into exclusive possessions.
In the most horrific period in human history, bilateralism had the upper hand.
Between 1914 and 1945, the pursuit of national grandeur led to ruinous economic rivalry and mass violence.
The Wall Street crash of 1929 kicked the legs out from under a struggling international order.
Country after country turned inward; by 1933, world trade collapsed to one-third its 1929 level.
Fueled by racism and fears of overcrowding, globalism turned predatory: powerful countries imposed uneven trade pacts on neighbors and partners, or simply overran them.
Japan set its sights on Manchuria in 1931 to create a puppet state, and invaded China in 1937.
The Soviets dealt with Russian borderlands in the same spirit.
The Nazis forced treaties on weaker neighbors and seized others, then sought to depopulate Slavic lands to make way for Teutonic settlers.
The brutality of bilateralism prompted US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to draft the Atlantic Charter in 1941.
A blueprint for a post-war order, it declared that freedom was the cornerstone of peace and that bilateralism had to be curbed. No more grabbing.
What came of the Allies’ victory in World War II and the Atlantic Charter was a Global New Deal: by agreeing to play by international rules and institutions, countries could participate in the post-war bonanza.
European integration was at the core of this experiment in multilateral globalism; with Franco-German reconciliation, Europe, a chronic conflict zone, became a region of exemplary cooperators.
Restraining national sovereignty allowed global trade, investment, and migration to buoy post-war prosperity. Billions escaped poverty.
But the Global New Deal seems to have run its course.
For too many people, the world became messy, risky, stultifying, and threatening – the opposite of what the Atlantic Charter envisioned.
After 1980, global integration was accompanied by rising domestic inequality.
While the horizon of opportunities widened for educated cosmopolitans in big cities, the bonds between citizens weakened as national social contracts were dismantled.
As the blurring of global divides deepened domestic cleavages, the stage was set for bilateralists to come storming back.
In the wings, leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin yearned for a return to a world of muscular sovereignty, unrestrained by multilateral niceties.
They now have more company in key countries.
Two days after his inauguration, Trump announced that the US would have “another chance” to seize Iraqi oil.
He then withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and vowed to re-negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The future of the hard-won Paris climate agreement is now in doubt.
Charges of currency manipulation and threats of protectionist measures have intensified.
With the UK, which gave the world free trade in the 1840s, having now decided to go it alone, the old Atlantic Charter allies are putting national sovereignty ahead of global public goods.
Now the global spotlight turns to France and its looming presidential election.
At stake is the sputtering Franco-German engine that has driven European integration and kept it at the center of the post-war multilateral system.
A victory for Le Pen in early May would spell the end of the EU, leaving German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the final pillar of a crumbling world order.
The country most refashioned by post-1945 internationalism would be its last bastion, surrounded by bilateralists in France, the UK, and Russia, with its main patron, the US, in the hands of nativists.
Imagine the scene a few weeks after a Le Pen victory, when the G7 leaders gather in a gilded hotel in Taormina, Sicily.
The US and Canada are feuding over NAFTA.
The UK is squabbling with France and Germany over Brexit.
Japan is reeling from the demise of the TPP.
And, as they turn their backs on global commitments, refugees, drowning by the boatload in the surrounding sea, provide an epitaph for a bygone era.

China’s Bad Bet Against America
CAMBRIDGE – Chinese-American relations are, once again, in a downswing.
China objected to President Barack Obama’s receiving the Dalai Lama in the White House, as well as to the administration’s arms sales to Taiwan.
There was ample precedent for both American decisions, but some Chinese leaders expected Obama to be more sensitive to what China sees as its “core interests” in national unity.
Things were not supposed to turn out this way.
A year ago, the Obama administration made major efforts to reach out to China.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to “being in the same boat,” and that China and the United States would “rise and fall together.”
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he spent more time consulting his Chinese counterparts than those in any other country.
Some observers even referred to a US-Chinese “G2” that would manage the world economy.
The G2 idea was always foolish.
Europe has a larger economy than both the US and China, and Japan’s economy is currently about the same size as China’s.
Their participation in the solution of global problems will be essential.
Nonetheless, growing US-Chinese cooperation within the G20 last year was a positive sign of bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation.
Whatever the concerns regarding the recent events related to the Dalai Lama and Taiwan, it is important to note that the deterioration in US-Chinese relations began beforehand.
Many American congressmen, for example, complain that American jobs are being destroyed by China’s intervention in currency markets to maintain an artificially low value for the yuan.
A second issue was China’s decision not to cooperate at the United Nations conference on global climate change in Copenhagen last December.
Not only did China resist measures that had been under negotiation for the preceding year, but Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s decision to send a low-level official to meet with and point a finger at Obama was downright insulting.
China behaved similarly when the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (plus Germany) met to discuss sanctions against Iran for violations of its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Again, China sent a low-ranking official.
What happened to those promising early signs of cooperation?
Two reasons for the change in Chinese behavior – seemingly inconsistent at first glance, but in fact perhaps mutually reinforcing – seem possible.
First, a political transition is expected in 2012, and, in a period of rising nationalism, no Chinese leader wants to look softer than his rivals.
This helps to explain the recent crackdowns in Tibet and Xingjian, as well as the detention of human rights lawyers.
In addition, China may be approaching an economic transition.
Some Chinese argue that anything less than 8% growth would be inadequate to ensure sufficient job creation and fend off social instability.
But, as America’s savings rate begins to rise, China’s export-led growth model, which has promoted employment in China at the cost of global trade imbalances, may no longer be possible.
If China responds to entreaties to revalue the yuan, it may need to look tough on other issues to appease nationalist sentiment.
The second cause of China’s recent behavior could be hubris and overconfidence.
China is justly proud of its success in emerging from the world recession with a high rate of economic growth.
It blames the US for producing the recession, and now holds some $2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves.
Many Chinese believe that this represents a shift in the global balance of power, and that China should be less deferential to other countries, including the US.
Certain Chinese scholars are now writing about the decline of the US, with one identifying the year 2000 as the peak of American power.
This overconfidence in foreign policy, combined with insecurity in domestic affairs, may combine to explain the change in Chinese behavior in the latter part of 2009.
If so, China is making a serious miscalculation.
First, the US is not in decline.
Americans and others have been predicting decline regularly over the years: after the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957; again when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971; and when the American rust-belt economy seemed to be overtaken by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980’s.
But when one looks at the underlying strength of the American economy, it is not surprising that the World Economic Forum ranks the US second (just behind Switzerland) among the most competitive, while China ranks some 30 places below.
Second, the fact that China holds so many dollars is not a true source of power, because the interdependence in the economic relationship is symmetrical.
True, if China dumped its dollars on world markets, it could bring the American economy to its knees, but in doing so it would bring itself to its ankles.
China would not only lose the value of its dollar reserves, but would suffer major unemployment.
When interdependence is balanced, it does not constitute a source of power.
Third, despite Chinese complaints, the dollar is likely to remain the major global reserve currency, owing to the depth and breadth of America’s capital markets, which China cannot match without making the yuan fully convertible and reforming its banking system.
Finally, China has miscalculated by violating the wisdom of Deng Xiaoping, who advised that China should proceed cautiously and “keep its light under a basket.”
As a senior Asian statesman told me recently, Deng would never have made this mistake.
If Deng were in charge today, he would lead China back to the cooperative relations with the US that marked early 2009.

The Mosque and Its Enemies
WASHINGTON, DC – Opposition to plans to build a mosque near “Ground Zero,” the spot where the World Trade Center’s twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, comes in various shades.
To their credit, many of the project’s opponents have avoided the crass bigotry that is becoming a standard trait of right-wing discourse in the United States.
But even moderate critics of the mosque (actually an Islamic cultural center with a prayer room called Park 51) betray in their arguments two assumptions that are as questionable as they are ingrained in the prevailing public discourse in the US.
The first of these misbegotten assumptions is to underrate social intolerance as a threat to freedom.
While accepting the project’s impeccable legal credentials, its opponents nevertheless demand that it be relocated on the grounds that even fully lawful conduct may be offensive to a group of citizens.
This is a dangerous road to take in a liberal society.
More than 150 years ago, in his essay On Liberty, John Stuart Mill demolished the belief that the quest for individual freedom is, above all, a struggle against the state.
This belief still features prominently in the rhetorical arsenal of US conservatives, notably in the inflamed proclamations of the Tea Party movement.
But, as any member of a historically persecuted community – from gays to Jews to Roma – can attest, social intolerance may curtail civil rights as much as any law.
Indeed, up until the 1967 Supreme Court ruling that struck down anti-miscegenation laws throughout the US, interracial marriages were an oddity even where they were legally allowed.
A majority considered them offensive, and therefore expected interracial couples to show what is demanded today from Muslims in Manhattan: respect for other people’s sensitivities.
In a nation of laws, such as the US, it is disingenuous and unfair to grant legal protection to a right – in this case the right to worship God as we see fit – and then selectively ban its exercise de facto because a majority or minority takes offense.
Thus, the strident calls to stop the Park 51 project are as serious a threat to freedom as an outright legal ban.
If Muslims are not to be allowed to build anything Islamic anywhere near Ground Zero, let those who feel insulted strive to change the law through an open democratic process in which the reasons for a legal ban can be argued openly and without fig leafs.
Democracy demands no less.
The second, more invidious assumption of the opponents of Park 51 concerns what happened in September 2001.
Some of the project’s adversaries claim that it must be stopped because it will be a tribute to the perpetrators of a despicable deed.
Underlying this argument is the idea that the attack was an explicitly religious act carried out by an enemy faith, whose believers – even those who denounced the atrocity – are tainted and deserve to have their constitutional rights restricted.
Feeling uncomfortable with this rationale, other opponents deny the religious nature of the dispute and make clear that theirs is not a quarrel with Islam.
Instead, they couch their opposition to Park 51 in terms of sensitivity to the aggrieved.
Of course, if their reasoning were followed to its logical conclusion, allowing the project to be built would be the most robust statement that this dispute really does not have anything to do with religion.
The real problem, however, lies elsewhere.
For the moment one stops seeing the terrorist attacks of 2001 as a purely religious statement, one is forced to confront the elephant in the room: the attacks were, in essence, a political statement.
At its root it is possible to find concrete US government decisions made over the years, from nurturing alliances with corrupt and authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes to maintaining a conspicuous military presence in Saudi Arabia and showing a general obliviousness to the plight of Palestinians in the occupied territories.
The policies that resulted from these decisions may or may not be necessary for America’s long-term security interests, but it is undeniable that they have fueled a backlash in the Muslim world which has, on occasion, reared its head in murderous ways.
In any case, disputes over these policies are far from a theological conflict.
For nearly a decade, any attempt to recast the debate about the events of September 11, 2001, away from the prevailing theological narrative has been depicted as subversive and unpatriotic.
One only has to recall the vitriol visited upon Rev. Jeremiah Wright during the last presidential campaign for his now infamous sermon in which he said that, with the attacks, the chickens of US foreign policy had come home to roost.
It is possible to disagree with Wright and his ilk, but it is hardly disputable that public debate in the US has systematically failed to engage in a serious discussion about the disturbing political issues that lurk beneath – although never justify – those attacks.
Perhaps that is why most opponents of Park 51 have sought refuge in the religious narrative of the terrorist attacks.
After all, it is a narrative that, while demanding a suspension of one’s critical faculties, bestows an unmitigated blessing upon those purportedly fighting on the side of light.
The other option – that US policy was in the terrorists’ crosshairs – is too upsetting for these opponents to contemplate.
We can only hope that the American public will reject not just the insistent calls to derail the construction of the Park 51 project, but also the contested assumptions that underpin opposition to it.
Doing so would re-affirm American freedom and tolerance, and make the US a stronger and more respected actor abroad.

America’s Second Sputnik Moment?
CAMBRIDGE – The burgeoning trade war between the United States and China has as much to do with technology as with the balance of trade.
Reports have surfaced that the US Treasury Department is drafting rules to block Chinese firms from investing in American companies doing business in so-called industrially significant technology, while the Commerce Department is planning new export controls to keep such technologies out of Chinese hands.
These moves follow US President Donald Trump’s proposal to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products, many of which are on the priority list for “Made in China 2025,” President Xi Jinping’s blueprint to transform China into a global leader in high-tech industries like aerospace, robotics, pharmaceuticals, and machinery.
Although the Chinese government has refused to modify its initiative, the US is demanding that China end all government subsidies and grants under the program.
Trade talks have stumbled on this point.
America’s concern with Made in China 2025 is understandable; China’s approach to technology development has been controversial, to say the least.
But there are better ways to respond to China’s policies. Two ways, to be precise.
First, America and other trade partners must continue to confront China on its intellectual-property (IP) violations and market-access inequities.
Under free-market competition, one country’s successes in science and technology should not come at others’ expense.
Innovations like new cancer drugs or faster computing should benefit people everywhere – not only those fortunate enough to live in the country where the discoveries happen to have been developed.
With a deep pool of talent, China has much to contribute to progress in science and technology; the world should welcome China’s efforts to innovate.
But the terms of competition and development must be market-conforming, not market-distorting.
Given China’s spotty record on market access and IP protection, the US is right to consider how the Made in China 2025 strategy will affect American interests.
Its policymakers should focus, however, on getting the rules of the game right, rather than stopping Chinese innovation per se.
The second response is even more important: as China develops its innovative capabilities, the US must invest more in its own science and technology base.
Visionary leaders, rather than cowering in fear of Made in China 2025, should use it to galvanize support for science and technology.
In other words, “Made in China 2025” could be another “Sputnik moment” for America.
When the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik 1, the world’s first man-made satellite, on October 4, 1957, the achievement sent shock waves through the US government, which responded with huge investments in rocket technology, research, and education.
In less than a year, President Dwight Eisenhower had approved funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and launched Project Mercury, NASA’s first human spaceflight program.
In 1959, Congress allocated $134 million to the National Science Foundation, an increase of nearly $100 million from the previous year.
By 1968, the NSF’s budget had increased to nearly $500 million.
During this period, the US government also stepped up research support and poured money into programs to strengthen American students’ skills in math and science.
Collectively, the US response to Sputnik propelled advances in aeronautical science, microelectronics, integrated circuits, and communications.
It is not an exaggeration to say that government policies in this period laid the foundation for decades of US dominance in global science and technology development.
Made in China 2025 demands a similar response.
But at the moment, America’s commitment to innovation remains grounded.
Not only is the Trump administration failing to support innovation; it is also actively derailing investments in tech-related research.
For example, Trump is trying to revive dirty fuels like coal, which powered the first Industrial Revolution, rather than investing in solar, wind, and other renewables that will power the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.”
Trump is not the only guilty party; Congress has been equally uninspired for years.
According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, federal funding for research and development in 2017 fell by 23.6% in real terms compared to 2007.
Since 1976, federal spending on R&D has actually declined as a percentage of GDP – from 1.2% to just 0.7% this year.
Furthermore, instead of supporting advanced education, the Trump administration has proposed cutting $3.6 billion (a 5.3% reduction) for such support from the 2019 education budget.
At the same time, the tax legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in December 2017 imposes an unprecedented tax on those university endowments valued at over $500,000 per student.
While only a handful of schools will be affected, the hardest hit include major centers of research like MIT, the University of Chicago, Harvard, and Stanford – the very institutions the US must rely on to maintain a competitive advantage.
America needs another Sputnik initiative.
Innovation hates a vacuum: If the US fails to boost its support for science and technology, other countries should and will fill the void.
Ultimately, the enemy of American innovation is not trade or Made in China 2025. The real enemy is American leaders’ own lack of vision.

Global Energy Realism
MADRID – Energy has become a focal point of global policymaking.
As falling oil prices grab headlines worldwide, US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have signed a major climate-change deal, and October’s European Council decisions could signal real progress toward a serious European Union energy policy.
This momentum should be maintained in the coming year, culminating in December’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris.
But, in order to establish a global energy system that meets growing demand within the constraints of carbon neutrality, we must avoid the pitfalls that have plagued past responses.
In particular, we must strike the proper balance between ideology and realism, the public and private sectors, and long- and short-term considerations.
And, critically, we must follow through on our commitments.
When it comes to ideology and realism, the European Union is perhaps the best example of an imbalanced approach, as Europeans’ tendency to lead with their hearts, rather than their heads, has undermined effective action.
The knee-jerk rejection of nuclear power by some EU member countries has led to sharp increases in coal usage.
Renewables have been pursued with a sort of missionary zeal, regardless of their effectiveness or feasibility.
And the EU’s “20/20/20 targets” – a 20% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, a 20% share for renewables, and a 20% increase in energy efficiency, all by 2020 – was more of a mantra than a policy.
Bridging the gap between the public and private sectors is vital to finance the construction of an efficient global energy system.
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040, the annual investment required in energy-supply infrastructure alone will total $2 trillion, up 20% from current levels.
Over the next 26 years, some $51 trillion will be needed.
This is just part of the overall infrastructure investment shortfall, which stands at $1 trillion annually – far more than what governments can afford.
That is why governments must build innovative partnerships with private-sector actors, while recognizing that energy, as a public good, must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight.
There have been some notable moves in this direction, though it remains to be seen whether they will translate into real action.
China has spearheaded the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
More important, the World Bank, the G-20, and the EU recently launched initiatives aimed at directing the financing power of business toward infrastructure development.
The World Bank’s Global Infrastructure Facility is an open platform that brings together multilateral development banks, national governments, and private finance to shepherd infrastructure projects to completion and to fill in gaps that have hampered investment.
Pivotal to sparking this investment is the mitigation of associated political risks, especially through an enhanced role for the Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.
Similarly, at last month’s summit in Brisbane, the G-20 created a new Global Infrastructure Hub to facilitate information-sharing, thereby streamlining infrastructure projects.
And, the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility has allocated €5.85 billion ($7.2 billion) from now until 2020 to help kick-start private investment in infrastructure projects linking member countries’ energy systems.
Of course, the need for private-sector involvement extends beyond investment.
The private sector is also better situated to research and develop new production methods that limit demand for fossil fuels.
To spur such action, the public sector should offer funds or guarantees, which, though risky, could offer huge benefits.
US government funding of research into hydraulic fracturing – the technology now driving the surge in America’s oil and gas production – dates back to the 1970s.
This brings us to the need to balance short-term imperatives with long-term vision.
Energy projects and policies today must account for the projected increase in emerging-market demand, while ensuring sufficient investment in future generating capacity.
For example, over the next 25 years, 60% of the EU’s generating capacity is due to retire – contributing to demand for $2.2 trillion of energy investment.
Furthermore, with US tight-oil production expected to peak in the early 2020s, new sources must be developed, such as in Iraq.
Given the long lead time for bringing new projects onstream, efforts to address the coming shortfall must begin today.
In all of these efforts, there is one common imperative: matching words with deeds.
The world does not need more commitments and pledges; it needs action.
Yet many countries continue to issue weak declarations that fail to produce genuine progress.
Once again, this problem is particularly pervasive in Europe.
The maxims of today – the need for diverse suppliers, enhanced interconnection, greater efficiency, and a sensible energy mix – have been discussed for at least a decade.
In fact, despite the seemingly unending stream of new energy initiatives and projects, Europe has made little progress; its energy situation may even be worse.
Repackaging the same old strategies – here one need look no further than European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker’s much-hyped €300 billion investment package – simply will not work.
With attention focused on COP21 next December, the coming year will be an exceptional opportunity to build a sound global energy system.
Europe, which has prided itself on its energy leadership, should set an example by developing – and then implementing – a realistic long-term strategy that involves the private sector.

Firebombing the Messenger in Armenia
Late last month, while putting the finishing touches on the next edition of our newspaper, Haykakan Zhamanak (The Armenian Times), we heard an explosion outside our office.
Staff members rushed to find my car on fire.
That explosion was not unanticipated – nor was the announcement by Armenia’s police that the car had caught fire due to technical problems.
But the real problem is censorship, for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia’s hidden war against the press.
For us the battle for press freedom began in 1999, soon after founding our newspaper, then named Oragir (Diary).
It made an instant impact, but not in the way we hoped.
Throughout 1999 there were more court cases against Oragir than against all other Armenian media combined since independence in 1991.
In one case, the prosecutor’s office brought criminal charges against me as editor-in-chief: I was accused of slandering an Armenian political figure and of insulting a state official.
As a result, the court sentenced me to one year in prison.
By a lucky twist, however, on the day the court ruled, Lord Russell Johnston, Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, was in Armenia.
Lord Johnston expressed his opinion about my case in his talks with the authorities, which then decided not to send me to prison.
I remained free, only to be monitored by the police.
A second trial against our newspaper had worse consequences: a $25,000 fine (a huge sum here) based on allegations that we had damaged the reputation of the Mika Armenia Company, controlled by the so-called Karabakh clan that helps rule Armenia.
The court’s verdict was based on falsified documents.
Following the verdict, bailiffs confiscated our equipment, prohibited the publishing house from printing our newspaper, and, most importantly, seized our business bank accounts, rendering us unable to pay the fine.
These events were initiated by a court wrangle with Serzh Sargsyan, then the Minister of National Security and Internal Affairs.
We demanded an apology for his impugning our paper’s reputation; he accused of us of libel.
These manipulations worked: Oragir was closed down, which forced us to appear under the name Haykakan Zhamanak .
When my time under police supervision ended, the prosecutor’s office quickly brought a new criminal case of slander against me.
This time, Armenia’s chief of civil aviation had sued me.
Investigations lasted several months, before pressure from international organizations and public opinion forced the prosecutor to drop the charges.
Later, after his dismissal from his post, that same civil aviation chief confessed that Armenian President Robert Kocharyan had advised him to file his lawsuit.
At a press conference just hours after my car exploded, I announced my suspicion that the explosion had been organized by Gagik Tsarukyan, an MP nicknamed “Dodi Gago” (“dod” means stupid in Armenian) and one of the country’s richest men and a close friend of the president’s family.
Many Armenians believe that Tsarukyan has carte blanche to do whatever he wants, when he wants.
Indeed, he even gets to write his own history.
For although Gagik Tsarukyan was convicted of a sexual crime in the Soviet era, two years ago Armenia’s courts exonerated him by vacating the decision of the Soviet court.
Indeed, there is something of a taboo on writing about Tsarukyan, and with good reason: not only is he rich, but also he controls an army of obedient skinheads.
Armenia frequently sees skinheads attacking reporters covering opposition rallies and once severely beating a leading opposition politician.
Five years ago, Tsarukyan himself led his thugs in a break-in at our office, taking my staff hostage for several hours.
Recently, after reading some unflattering articles about him in our paper, Tsarukyan tried to invite me to a meeting.
I refused.
Armenia’s paramount oligarch fumed.
He promised to punish me, and that he would act the next time Haykakan Zhamanak criticized any well-known person.
The car explosion occurred the day after we rebuked Armenia’s Police Chief.
None of us are surprised that the police are unwilling to investigate my car’s explosion.
They began to do so only ten days later, when the fire brigade stated that the fire was likely the result of an explosion incited by “outside interference.”
Such harassment is the everyday stuff of journalism in what Vladimir Putin calls the “post-Soviet space.”
Armenia may have adopted in 1995 a new Constitution with fine phrases about freedom of speech, but both the petty harassments and the mortal threats of the Soviet era remain.
Of course, we never believed that press freedom would come easily.
We understood from the start that we would have to fight for it everyday.
But we never imagined the terrifying lengths to which the state – working hand-in-hand with the new oligarchic rich – would go to defeat our cause.
We will not be defeated.
An incinerated car is a small price to pay in the battle for freedom.

The ECB’s Leap into the Unknown
FRANKFURT – The European Central Bank is in the middle of a big, risky experiment.
Key interest rates have remained close to zero for six years now.
Financial markets are flooded with liquidity.
Crisis management has resulted in major market distortions, with some segments’ performance no longer explainable by fundamental economic data.
The unintended consequences of this policy are increasingly visible – and will become increasingly tangible with the US Federal Reserve’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy.
And yet Europe’s crisis is far from over, as the decisions by the European Central Bank’s Governing Council in June and September demonstrate.
This reflects two factors: too little ambition in carrying out essential balance-sheet corrections, and slow progress – negligible in France and Italy – in restructuring Europe’s national economies.
The ECB’s decision to double down on monetary stimulus should thus be regarded as an act of desperation.
Its key rate has been cut to 0.05%, the deposit rate is negative, and targeted longer-term refinancing operations are supposed to support bank lending.
Moreover, the asset-backed securities market is to be revived by the purchase of ABSs.
All of this is intended to flood the markets, expand the euro system’s balance sheet by €700 billion ($890 billion), and return to the balance-sheet volume recorded at the start of 2012.
The expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet and the targeted depreciation of the euro should help to bring the eurozone’s short-term inflation rate close to 2% and thus reduce deflationary risks.
For the first time in its history, the ECB appears to be pursuing an exchange-rate target.
As was the case for the Bank of Japan, the external value of the currency will become an important instrument in the framework of a new strategic approach.
Financial markets have applauded the ECB’s recent decisions.
Moreover, having “effectively thrown off all of the Maastricht Treaty restrictions that bound the bank to the model of the Deutsche Bundesbank,” as former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan put it, the ECB is prepared to break further taboos.
But for what purpose?
Particularly by guaranteeing highly indebted countries’ sovereign bonds, the ECB has actually weakened the willingness to reform, particularly in the larger European Union countries, whose decrepit economic structures are an obstacle to potential growth, and where more room must be given to private initiative.
The ECB’s willingness to buy ABSs is especially risky and creates a new element of joint liability in the eurozone, with European taxpayers on the hook in the event of a loss.
The ECB lacks the democratic legitimacy to take such far-reaching decisions, with potentially substantial redistributive effects, which implies an even greater risk to monetary-policy independence.
Indeed, the ECB already has been driven onto the defensive by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, financial-market analysts, and Anglo-Saxon economists in the wake of feverish discussion of the risk of deflation in the eurozone.
But what is the appropriate eurozone inflation rate, given de facto economic stagnation?
Should higher nominal (that is, inflation-driven) growth replace debt-driven growth?
Europe must aim for sustainable, non-inflationary growth and the creation of competitive jobs.
The current inflation rate of 0.3% is due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the painful but unavoidable adjustment of costs and prices in the peripheral countries.
Only Greece currently has a slightly negative inflation rate.
In other words, price stability reigns in the eurozone.
This strengthens purchasing power and ultimately private consumption.
The ECB has fulfilled its mandate for the present and the foreseeable future.
There is no need for policy action in the short term.
It is, instead, the eurozone governments that must act.
But any clear division of tasks and responsibilities between governments and central banks has, it seems, been jettisoned.
Government action in many problem countries ultimately ends in finger pointing: “Europe,” the ECB, and Germany, with its (relatively) responsible policy, have all been scapegoats.
Against this background, the ECB has yielded to immense political pressure, particularly from France and Italy, to loosen monetary policy further and weaken the exchange rate.
But indulging the old political reflex of manipulating the exchange rate to create a competitive advantage will yield a short-term fix at best.
It will not eliminate the structural weaknesses of the countries in question.
The ECB is moving ever farther into uncharted territory.
In view of the insufficient balance-sheet corrections in the private sector and inadequate structural reforms, macroeconomic demand-management tools will not work.
Despite the ECB’s aggressive approach, monetary policy in the absence of structural economic reform risks being ineffective.
Simply put, more liquidity will not lead to more active bank lending until there is more transparency regarding the extent of non-performing loans and the relevant economies have become more flexible.
The ECB’s asset quality review and bank stress tests are expected to bring some clarity to the first question.
Then, more lending will occur on acceptable terms – assuming that there is corresponding demand.
But the uncertainty regarding the extent and pace of economic reforms remains.
The ECB’s recent decisions, with their focus on short-term effects, indicate that monetary policy is no longer targeted at the eurozone as a whole, but at its problem members.
Ad hoc decisions have replaced a feasible and principled medium-term strategy.
The problems created by this approach will be compounded by the unavoidable conflicts of interest with monetary policy implied by the ECB’s assumption of its new financial-stability and banking-supervision roles.
The first casualty will most likely be price stability.

The Visible Hand of Economic Prosperity
FRANKFURT – Germany has weathered the financial crisis much better than most of its neighbors.
Regarded as the sick man of Europe as recently as 1999, today the country boasts the continent's strongest economy, accounting for roughly a quarter of its exports.
Its unemployment rate, at just below 5%, is half the European average.
The federal budget is balanced for the first time in a decade.
But it would be a mistake to assume that Germany's economic performance vindicates its policymaking.
In fact, Germany's current economic dominance has been built on a policy framework that stands in direct opposition to that championed by former Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, the father of its post-World War II “economic miracle."
In lieu of Erhard's so-called ordoliberalism – in which the state lays the groundwork for a functioning market economy by actively managing the legal environment – the economic strategy pursued by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been haphazard, driven more by political expediency than by any underlying philosophy.
Germany would be wise not to take its economic success for granted.
In a time of increasing economic and political uncertainty, Erhard's guiding principles are more important than ever.
Indeed, Germany's policymakers seem to be stumbling from decision to decision.
Instead of steering the economy, they are being driven by it, reacting with no clear sense of direction to the demands of the moment.
The country's celebrated de-carbonization is putting its industry at risk.
Collective bargaining, once left to economic actors, is becoming increasingly politicized.
Changes in pension policy are boosting public spending and contributing to rising levels of debt.
At the heart of Germany's troubles is the stubborn – and internationally widespread – idea that the economy is a large, clock-like mechanism into which the state can intervene without consequences.
The increasing mathematization of economics in recent decades has abetted this development.
The central weakness of democratic systems also contributes to the problem: The quest for votes favors the extension of social benefits and discourages unpopular measures that would put the economy on a more sustainable footing.
As the German economist Herbert Giersch once put it, what is politically expedient is rarely economically beneficial.
It is for this reason that a return to ordoliberalism is more important than ever.
Erhard's objective was to counter political pragmatism and activism with an orderly vision of economic and social policy.
The need to take a holistic view of the economy was self-evident.
For today's social engineers and economists, this is no longer the case.
Erhard's vision of a social market economy was a third way, an alternative to both large-scale state intervention and the risks of laissez-faire liberalism. Germany's historical experience had demonstrated that freedom without order led to chaos, and order without freedom resulted in coercion and the renunciation of democracy.
Unguided capitalism undermined itself, according to Erhard, as monopolists cornered markets and captured the state.
But the attempt to perfect life through increasingly comprehensive state intervention, until even the smallest injustices were compensated, was also bound to fail.
Human society simply does not follow the rules of a termite colony; order must accommodate freedom and individuality.
The continuing relevance of Erhard's ideas can be seen in the growing number of protest movements – strengthened by social networks – challenging the market economy and neoliberalism.
Any increase in the market's perceived legitimacy brought about by the failure of communism was temporary at best.
Market-oriented policies today are seen as cold and anti-social, especially in Western industrialized countries.
The paternalistic welfare state is viewed as more humane, despite the loss of freedom and the financial distortions associated with it.
Erhard was well aware of the tension between economic freedom and the democratic state.
He and his followers never envisaged ordoliberalism as an unchangeable dogma, but rather as a model that could be adapted to new challenges.
Erhard even attempted to adjust it to the sociopolitical changes of the 1960s, developing the concept of a “formed society," whereby factionalism would be minimized and the state governed by consensus.
Erhard failed to gain support for this controversial idea.
But, given rising inequality and growing disenchantment with politics and political parties, it addresses questions that remain relevant for representative democracy today.
As Erhard himself would have argued, ordoliberalism is not a one-size-fits-all solution.
But there can be no question that in today's globalized world, the economy – and perhaps politics as well – would benefit from the imposition of order.
No political system capable of overcoming hardship and misery can be built without first realizing improvements in the economy's potential.
That must be achieved by minimizing state intervention, bureaucracy, and privileges for the chosen few.
Erhard's guiding principle was simple: there must be guiding principles.
It is an idea that remains as important as ever – in Germany and beyond.

The Fog of Disorder
MUNICH – Which emerging threat is the world missing right now?
After a truly horrendous year for international peace and security, this question will be even more important for the leaders, analysts, and media gathering this week at the 51st Munich Security Conference (MSC).
A year ago, the war in Syria and the crisis in Ukraine were the international community’s preoccupying challenges.
But many of the participants in last year’s MSC would likely now admit that they did not appreciate the true gravity of these events – let alone what might come next.
Only a few months later, the rapid escalation and regionalization of both crises, together with developments elsewhere, led many observers to proclaim that 2014 marked the beginning of a less peaceful and more chaotic era in international relations.
Numerous flaws and points of erosion in existing collective security structures have been revealed over the past year.
Terms like the “The Great Unraveling,” coined by the journalist Roger Cohen in the fall of 2014, resonate widely because they capture the current sense of helplessness, lack of control, and inability to predict or grasp which crisis might come next.
As Javier Solana recently put it, “We have been living in an illusion.
For years, the world has believed that the transition from a unipolar to a multipolar order would be peaceful, orderly, and steady [...]. How wrong we were.”
That illusion coexisted happily with a lack of imagination.
While it may sound elegant to distinguish between the “right” and the “wrong” side of history, or to criticize the use of nineteenth-century methods in the twenty-first century, such arguments amount to little more than rhetorical devices.
At best, they do no harm; at worst, they obscure the complexities of today’s security landscape that need to be understood and addressed.
For starters, war has returned to Europe.
Fundamental principles of pan-European security are part of the wreckage, and so may be the progress in relations between Russia and the West made since the Cold War’s end.
Moreover, the Arab world, more violent and unstable than it has been in many decades, seems likely to fragment even further, while radical jihadist groups, energized and competing with one another, are increasingly directing their rage at the West again.
And in the Asia-Pacific region, even though major incidents were avoided, stability remains precarious.
Sadly, the cracks exposed over the last few months appear likely only to widen, as political conflict and competition among the world’s key powers increase.
Indeed, in ten years, 2014 will probably be regarded as a prelude.
But to what?
Even as the international order and regional arrangements are increasingly tested, it is unclear who will be able, or even willing, to uphold peace and stability.
Fears that the United States is abandoning its global leadership role are certainly exaggerated.
But, at the very least, President Barack Obama’s declared focus on “nation-building at home” has created a perception of retreat that worries many allies.
In Europe, meanwhile, many countries are still trying to overcome the impact of the financial and economic crisis of 2008, as well as domestic policy paralysis and rising Euroskepticism.
Europe’s global role, for all its potential, will not be spelled out in a meaningful way anytime soon.
Over the course of the last year, Germany debated whether it should take on a more active international role, but the German public is adjusting only gradually to new expectations.
Though some surveys suggest that Germany’s culture of restraint is not as entrenched as many believe, a new poll conducted for the Munich Security Report finds that only 34% of Germans think that their country should become more engaged in international crises.
A significant majority of Germans remain skeptical of adopting a more active global stance, suggesting that any effort to assume an international leadership role remains an uphill battle.
Of course, not all breakdowns in order can be attributed to domestic politics, economic considerations, or shifting great power relations.
The number of relevant actors and potential spoilers on the world stage has skyrocketed, further weakening governments’ ability to resolve problems on their own or in coordination with one another.
But collapsing orders are both a cause and an effect of their traditional and potential guardians’ increasing reluctance.
As leaders stop acting the way they used to, or fail to do as much as a situation might warrant, other actors test the limits.
As orders crumble and become harder to maintain or manage, traditional and potential leaders increasingly consider the challenge too great, or they rely heavily on quick fixes and stop-gap measures, further fueling unpredictability and instability.
It was at this intersection of test and trepidation that today’s vicious circle of geopolitical turmoil was set in motion.
Against this backdrop, there is no reason to believe that predicting major crises, let alone containing them, will become any easier.
Growing global complexity intensifies the problem.
Overwhelmed by a surfeit of information, governments and key international institutions find themselves overlooking or misjudging the signals amid the noise.
And it is becoming much more difficult for leaders to focus on a few critical items, which would likely increase the quality of their decision-making.
Many old assumptions died in 2014.
At this year’s MSC, the world will have an opportunity to consider what should replace them.

Beyond the Sino-Japanese Rivalry
China's government has sentenced two of its citizens to life in prison for their role in securing prostitutes for hundreds of male Japanese visitors in the southern city of Zhuhai last autumn.
The Chinese government is also pressuring Tokyo to turn over the Japanese businessmen who allegedly requested the prostitutes.
This story made headlines around the world, and fits well with how the world press typically covers Sino-Japanese relations.
Regrettably, such incidents recur with enough regularity to feed the media machine that continues to stir a nationalism rooted in conflicting historical memories.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine - which is widely viewed as a symbol of Japan's former militarism - is a conspicuous example of this.
The publicity that the press gives to these visits has helped impede an invitation to Koizumi from China's leaders for a state visit.
Recently, the discovery of mustard gas canisters left behind by Japanese forces during World War II has also served to keep memories of the Imperial Japanese Army's wartime conduct alive among older Chinese.
Moreover, rival Sino-Japanese claims to the Senkaku (or Diao Yutai) Islands resurfaced last year when the Japanese government leased three islets in the chain from private parties.
The action, purportedly undertaken to reduce the prospect of landings and demonstrations by Japanese right-wingers, set off a brief, though frenzied, reaction in China, as well as in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Meanwhile, differences over Taiwan also foster tensions periodically, such as when former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui sought to visit Japan for medical treatment.
But this is not the whole story.
Although such incidents reveal a troubling level of mistrust between the Chinese and Japanese that is not merely a product of media coverage, it is noteworthy that both governments have worked consistently, diligently, and with considerable success to resolve such problems and contain their political fallout.
Of course, official relations between the two countries are marked by much political and economic competition - some of it healthy, some of it a possible harbinger of future strategic rivalry.
The competitive strain in Sino-Japanese relations is especially visible in energy politics.
Demand for oil in Asia is growing rapidly, and with China and Japan increasingly dependent upon imports, each has naturally sought to improve its energy security by diversifying sources of supply.
Both countries covet access to Russian reserves, especially those located in the Angarsk fields of Siberia.
Last spring China appeared to have locked up a Russian commitment to build a pipeline to service the China market at Daqing.
Japan, however, raised the ante with new offers of financial incentives.
Its bid for an alternative pipeline to Nakodka to serve Japanese, Korean, and other markets remains alive, creating another point of competitive friction.
In their rivalry for leadership in promoting Asian regional cooperation, meanwhile, China has taken an early lead.
Two years ago, China trumped Japan by offering a Free Trade Agreement to the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, while front-loading its own tariff concessions.
More recently, China, along with India, signed an ASEAN-proposed Treaty of Commerce and Amity, while the Japanese hesitated.
In addition, China has served as the principal broker in talks between the US and North Korea on nuclear issues, in which Japan has a huge stake.
But this backdrop of contention and competition masks emerging collaborative aspects of Sino-Japanese relations that are profoundly important, but which, unfortunately, seem to the world's media to be too mundane to "sell."
For example, trade and investment flows continue to expand rapidly.
Bilateral trade topped $100 billion in 2003, as Japan's exports to China increased by more than 10%, fuelled by semiconductors, electrical equipment, and automobiles.
Meanwhile, China replaced the US as Japan's biggest source of imports, and is now one of the few non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with which Japan runs a trade deficit.
Similarly, direct investment by Japanese firms is increasing as they relocate production facilities to China to capitalize on lower labor costs and high-quality engineering talent.
Even the 20% cut in Japan's Official Development Assistance for China scarcely harmed their smooth economic ties.
Of course, there is no assurance that today's expanded commerce will preclude eventual strategic rivalry, or succeed in erasing lingering wartime animosity.
But both countries now place a premium on extending their economic interdependence.
China sees economic ties as a way to hasten its modernization.
Japan sees them as a way to enhance its international competitiveness, and to provide China with incentives for geopolitical moderation.
Most importantly, a new generation of leaders in both countries seems less hung up on divisive memories.
They may also see in Europe's surge toward economic integration a model for themselves and an inducement to intensifying regional cooperation.
Pragmatic leaders in both countries clearly recognize the benefits of diplomatic collaboration on issues that affect the region, such as North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
Ultimately, the historical wounds that have long divided China and Japan, and the more current diplomatic flashpoints that the global media inevitably trumpet, only tell part of the Sino-Japanese story.
There are economic and geopolitical rivalries between China and Japan that dwarf in importance the high-profile insults to national pride that make headlines.
But there are also compelling economic and political inducements toward cooperation that prevent these rivalries from developing into full-blown crises.

The Politics of Financial Volatility
LONDON – Twenty-four years ago, in the midst of an ugly US presidential campaign, Bill Clinton’s campaign manager neatly summed up his candidate’s message: “It’s the economy, stupid.” Today, as investors struggle to understand what is driving extreme volatility in the financial markets, there is an equally pithy explanation: It’s the stupid politics.
Central bank policies have moved from supporting the markets to potentially destabilizing them.
Now markets are turning to structural reform and fiscal policy for assistance.
In this light, current price movements should be viewed through the spectrum of geopolitics.
And it is not a nice view.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the oil markets, where prices have collapsed, with both Brent and Crude now hovering around the $30-per-barrel level.
The extent of oil’s fall, and consequent deflationary fears, is cited as a major factor behind overall market turmoil.
In January, the correlation between crude oil prices and the S&P 500 reached the highest level since 1990.
It has become increasingly clear that supply dynamics, rather than falling demand, explain the drop from $110/barrel since the summer of 2014.
The shift to competitive pricing implied by the breakdown of Saudi Arabia’s monopoly power, together with OPEC’s desire to counter the threat from US shale energy, drove the first downward move.
Likewise, the recent lifting of sanctions on Iran, and the resulting increase in global oil supply, prompted a further 9% price drop over a matter of days.
These supply dynamics are shaped by politics.
Daily headlines about potential coordinated measures by the key oil-producing countries fuel oil-price volatility and define risk appetite across financial markets.
Yet the politics is so confused that coordination appears unlikely, at best; the Iranian oil minister recently described a potential OPEC production freeze as a “joke.”
Iran’s parliamentary elections augment the uncertainty.
Aside from oil, the other popular explanation for today’s market tumult is the economic slowdown in China, which many investors have cited as the reason for slumping equity prices this year.
But the slowdown, reflecting China’s transition from investment-led to consumption-driven growth, was widely expected, and the 2015 growth figure of 6.8% was within forecasts.
The real problem has been self-inflicted policy errors by China’s political leaders.
An ill-advised intervention in the equity markets in July 2015, followed by a poorly communicated exchange-rate adjustment in August, led investors to question the competence of policymakers.
These concerns have grown since the beginning of the year.
Currency policy remains confused, while newly introduced (and soon withdrawn) stock-market circuit breakers have accelerated market falls, as investors try to sell shares before liquidity disappears.
Moreover, purchases by state-owned financial institutions, together with bans on sales by large institutional shareholders, cannot remain permanent features if the market is to be truly free.
Expected leadership changes – six of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee will be replaced over the next 18 months – will only exacerbate uncertainty.
Labile politics are increasingly driving outcomes in other emerging markets as well.
In Brazil, the government struggles to balance its populist agenda with lower commodity prices, dwindling growth, and persistent inflation.
Moreover, a corruption scandal has paralyzed reform.
Small wonder that Brazil’s stock market has fallen 28% since last May.
In Russia, too, politics has aggravated the negative oil-price shock.
Western sanctions have contributed to an already slowing growth trajectory, and are threatening Russia’s ability to raise debt capital in global markets.
The ruble has plummeted 130% since 2014 began, and GDP in 2015 contracted by 3.7%.
Yet Russia is a star performer compared to Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro’s government has overseen the economy’s total disintegration.
Indeed, analysts are declaring the country is past the “point of no return.”
Even the relatively dynamic India is struggling, as its exciting reform agenda is challenged by social protests.
In Europe, the efficacy of the European Central Bank’s monetary policies is waning as the political scene becomes increasingly fragile.
In the United Kingdom, polls show the June 23 referendum on continued European Union membership will be extremely tight – an obvious threat to market stability, reflected in the immediate sell-off of pounds.
Meanwhile, the migration crisis threatens Germany’s government; splits are now deepening within Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, which is losing popular support.
The unilateral decision by Austria and nine Balkan states to block the flow of migrants across their borders has fueled political turbulence.
The migrant crisis will have far-reaching ramifications, including the potential destruction of the Schengen zone.
In Southern Europe, Spain’s recent elections were inconclusive, and the absence of a stable government could derail an economic recovery that gained traction in 2015.
Meanwhile, the Italian government’s bank bail-ins have fueled volatility, with leading banks experiencing extraordinary one-day stock declines.
The damage to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s reputation for reliability has prompted fears of renewed political turmoil.
Turning to Japan, the strength in equities since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office has been founded on his “Abenomics” strategy’s “three arrows”: monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms.
The Bank of Japan has launched one arrow, expanding the monetary base to ¥80 trillion ($710 billion) and more recently adopting negative interest rates.
But momentum has faded considerably, as investors wait for the structural reforms needed for sustained improvement in economic, and market, fundamentals.
In the US, deep voter frustration has fueled Bernie Sanders’s leftist bid for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination and the astonishingly vitriolic campaign waged by Donald Trump.
With Trump’s lead for the Republican Party’s nomination widening following the “Super Tuesday” primaries in ten states, financial markets, which seek stability and predictability, are struggling to find it in the politics of the world’s largest economy.
History may not repeat itself, but let’s hope it finds its rhyme. Back in the 1990s, the US economy stabilized and then surged forward, driven by accelerating productivity and abetted by sound monetary and fiscal policy.
But economies may prove to be easier to mend than today’s dysfunctional politics, which may be part and parcel of the “new normal.”

Cushioning the Poor from the COVID-19 Shock
CAMBRIDGE – When India’s government announced, with four hours’ notice, a nationwide three-week lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus, millions of the country’s poorest citizens faced the risk of hunger and destitution.
Many migrant laborers, suddenly jobless, walked hundreds of miles from cities to their native villages.
There, too, the COVID-19 lockdown may be devastating: poor households cannot survive long – often not more than a few days – without an income.
These challenges are worldwide.
But developed-country governments have been using their capacity to borrow to implement massive relief packages intended to support companies, the poor, and the working- and middle-class families at risk of being pushed into poverty by layoffs and business closures.
Developing-country governments must find ways to do the same.
Expanding social protection to reach vulnerable people quickly must be a pillar of every country’s COVID-19 strategy.
To achieve this, resource-constrained governments must look to past experience and existing research to design the most effective and efficient programs possible.
Developing and implementing new social-protection programs takes time, so governments should build upon existing programs and platforms to ensure that all people have enough resources to meet their basic needs.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach; each country must assess the mechanisms it already has in place, and then decide how to expand or otherwise reform them.
But there are some general guidelines that can help.
Countries with cash-transfer programs should immediately broaden eligibility and increase the benefit.
Given the scale of the economic shock, concerns that wealthier households might receive benefits they do not need should take a backseat to the imperative of ensuring that vulnerable people – including informal workers and middle-class households, which would not typically qualify for welfare programs – are covered.
Our research suggests that on-demand applications – which require the unemployed to complete only a few steps, online or by phone, to gain access to benefits – would help governments to reach more people in need.
Additional verification could be carried out later.
Moreover, cash transfers should be targeted at the most affected areas, such as large cities, where high population density accelerates contagion and lockdowns are concentrated.
Without cash transfers to soften the blow, the urban poor will migrate, as they have in India, potentially spreading the virus to other cities and rural areas (where already-limited health-care capacity will quickly be overwhelmed).
Where possible, benefits should be distributed via digital platforms, thereby enabling people to avoid physical contact.
In the absence of such platforms, governments must be creative, using whatever touch points are available.
For example, cash could be distributed through local governments or networks using door-to-door delivery or staggered pickup dates and times, based on national identification numbers.
In Indonesia, where we work, many informal and middle-class workers have pension accounts; transfers could be deposited into those accounts, and early withdrawal restrictions could be relaxed.
Yet cash transfers alone may be insufficient to protect the poor from destitution and hunger if food supply chains break down.
Governments must also monitor food prices and food availability, and can manage localized shortages by expanding targeted food-distribution programs, releasing food stocks when necessary, and coordinating distribution with private companies.
Furthermore, governments could increase subsidies for existing public health insurance (even if only temporarily).
This would relieve households and businesses of the burden of health-care premiums and reduce the risk of overwhelming families with medical costs in the event of a health shock.
In good times, demand for health insurance in developing countries is low, with many signing up only when they are already sick.
But this is not simply a matter of short-term thinking: cumbersome or malfunctioning enrollment systems, low-quality services, and lack of experience with insurance can discourage people from signing up.
Temporary subsidies, together with simplified enrollment procedures, can help to overcome these hurdles, leading to broader health-insurance coverage, even after the subsidies are removed.
This is what happened in Indonesia when such a scheme was tested prior to the current crisis: offering informal workers temporary subsidies for public health insurance increased coverage eightfold, without raising unit costs, and many retained coverage beyond the subsidy period.
An effective COVID-19 response must also include lifelines for small businesses.
Formal small and medium-size enterprises comprise an estimated 90% of businesses and 50% of employment worldwide.
But, because such businesses often lack cash reserves and face severe credit constraints, many will not survive temporary closures without support.
For formal businesses, governments should consider tax deferments and holidays for hard-hit sectors.
Informal firms, which account for countless more jobs in developing countries, could work with banks and multilateral financial institutions to expand credit lines and cancel or suspend debt payments.
Some argue that welfare and subsidies discourage people from working.
But our research shows that, even under ordinary circumstances, beneficiaries do not work less or invest differently.
During this extraordinary period of social distancing and lockdowns, arguing about work incentives makes even less sense.
Governments are forcing people to exit from the economy, so it is incumbent upon governments to help those people survive.

From Prague Spring to Velvet Revolution
WARSAW – What was the Prague Spring, or the events of 1968 more generally?
Their meaning, it seems, has become more, not less, debatable with the passage of time.
My generation was forged by protests and police truncheons, by the hopes generated not only by the Prague Spring, but also by the Polish student movement that March, the Paris events of May, and the first signs of Russian democracy voiced in the early books of Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn.
For those of us imprisoned in Poland, the Prague Spring was a harbinger of hope.
Even Poland’s communist newspapers, read behind bars, somehow conveyed news of the great changes taking place in our neighbor to the south.
So I remember my shock when I learned about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August, and the trauma that lingered long after.
On the tenth anniversary of that invasion, Václav Havel, Jacek Kuron, and I, along with other dissidents, met on the Czech-Polish border.
There is a photograph of that occasion: future presidents, ministers, and parliamentarians who were at that time pursued by the police like common criminals.
These encounters were an extension of the climate of the Prague Spring.
We all felt that we were creating something new, something that might, one day, turn out to be an important component of democracy in our countries.
And so it was.
In August 1989, I proposed in the Polish Diet a draft resolution apologizing to the Czechs and Slovaks for Polish involvement in the 1968 invasion.
I felt that a historical circle was being closed: the ideas of the Polish March and the Prague Spring, the ideas of our mountain meetings, were becoming political facts.
Three months later, the Velvet Revolution began in Prague.
The main difference between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution was that the former was mostly the work of Communist Party members and others who wanted to bring about “socialism with a human face.”
As a result, some people nowadays dismiss the Prague Spring as a power struggle between communists.
But there were many roads to – and through – communism, and many of them converged with national traditions.
Indeed, communism was attractive for many reasons, including the idea of universal justice and humanized social relations; a response to the great spiritual crisis after World War I and, later, to the Nazis’ genocide; and the conviction that Western dominance of the world was nearing its end.
Finally, in a world divided by Yalta, communism was, for some, the only realistic choice for central Europe.
In Czechoslovakia in 1968, communist reformers appealed to democratic ideals that were deeply rooted in the country’s pre-World War II past.
Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the Czechoslovak communists and the symbol of the Prague Spring, personified hope for democratic evolution, real pluralism, and a peaceful way to a state governed by law and respectful of human rights.
By contrast, in Poland, which had witnessed its own tentative opening in the March student movement, a nationalist-authoritarian faction exploited all that was intolerant and ignorant in Polish tradition, employing xenophobia and anti-intellectual rhetoric.
Polish Interior Minister Mieczyslaw Moczar, the leader of the nationalist faction, combined communist rhetoric with a language proper to fascist movements in order to mobilize the masses against the “cosmopolitan-liberal intelligentsia.”
The Polish freedom movement of 1968 lost its confrontation with police violence; the Prague Spring was crushed by the armies of five Warsaw Pact members.
But in both countries, 1968 gave birth to a new political consciousness.
The Polish and Czech opposition movements that emerged only a few years later had their roots in the events of 1968.
The Prague Spring was provoked by a crisis in the Communist Party, but the claim that it was merely a result of political squabbles among Party members falsifies history and rejects a significant fragment of the national heritage.
Attitudes towards communism were always a controversial subject for the anticommunist opposition.
Some rejected communism in all its forms.
The majority though, in one way or another, had some contact with communism, through intellectual fascination, participation in state institutions, or the cold conviction that only by accepting the reality of life under communism could one do something useful for one’s country.
These people, “tainted by communism,” constituted the majority of the participants in all revolts against the communist dictatorships.
There was, however, another, category of people: the “careful and untainted,” who absented themselves from the world of politics. They hated communism, but, convinced that the system could not be reformed, they avoided the democratic opposition.
While others took risks or sat in jails, they functioned in official and legal structures.
One should not blame anyone today for such behavior. But it is surprising when these people accuse participants in the Prague Spring and the democratic opposition of links with communism.
Communism was obviously an instrument of Soviet domination over conquered societies, but it was also a modus vivendi for large parts of these nations under the conditions in which they were obliged to live.
Imre Nagy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt in 1956, and Dubcek became parts of their national legends, which belies the claim that communism was exclusively a foreign imposition.
The Prague Spring appealed to elementary values: freedom, pluralism, tolerance, sovereignty, and rejection of the dictates of communist orthodoxy.
When I recall these events after 40 years, I see not only revolt, but also the great illusion that it might be possible to outfox the Kremlin and painlessly move society from communism to democracy.
This belief was naïve, but it also underpinned a national awakening in which the potential for freedom found its voice.

Why Nation-Building Failed in Afghanistan
ISTANBUL – The United States invaded Afghanistan 20 years ago with the hope of rebuilding a country that had become a scourge to the world and its own people.
As General Stanley McChrystal explained in the run-up to the 2009 surge of US troops, the objective was that the “government of Afghanistan sufficiently control its territory to support regional stability and prevent its use for international terrorism.”
Now, with more than 100,000 lives lost and some $2 trillion spent, all America has to show for its effort are this month’s scenes of a desperate scramble out of the country – a humiliating collapse reminiscent of the fall of Saigon in 1975.
What went wrong?
Pretty much everything, but not in the way that most people think.
While poor planning and a lack of accurate intelligence certainly contributed to the disaster, the problem has in fact been 20 years in the making.
The US understood early on that the only way to create a stable country with some semblance of law and order was to establish robust state institutions.
Encouraged by many experts and now-defunct theories, the US military framed this challenge as an engineering problem: Afghanistan lacked state institutions, a functioning security force, courts, and knowledgeable bureaucrats, so the solution was to pour in resources and transfer expertise from foreigners.
NGOs and the broader Western foreign-aid complex were there to help in their own way (whether the locals wanted them to or not).
And because their work required some degree of stability, foreign soldiers – mainly NATO forces, but also private contractors – were deployed to maintain security.
In viewing nation-building as a top-down, “state-first” process, US policymakers were following a venerable tradition in political science.
The assumption is that if you can establish overwhelming military dominance over a territory and subdue all other sources of power, you can then impose your will.
Yet in most places, this theory is only half right, at best; and in Afghanistan, it was dead wrong.
Of course, Afghanistan needed a functioning state.
But the presumption that one could be imposed from above by foreign forces was misplaced.
As James Robinson and I argue in our 2019 book, The Narrow Corridor, this approach makes no sense when your starting point is a deeply heterogeneous society organized around local customs and norms, where state institutions have long been absent or impaired.
True, the top-down approach to state-building has worked in some cases (such as the Qin dynasty in China or the Ottoman Empire).
But most states have been constructed not by force but by compromise and cooperation.
The successful centralization of power under state institutions more commonly involves the assent and cooperation of the people subject to it.
In this model, the state is not imposed on a society against its wishes; rather, state institutions build legitimacy by securing a modicum of popular support.
This does not mean that the US should have worked with the Taliban.
But it does mean that it should have worked more closely with different local groups, rather than pouring resources into the corrupt, non-representative regime of Afghanistan’s first post-Taliban president, Hamid Karzai (and his brothers).
Ashraf Ghani, the US-backed Afghan president who fled to the United Arab Emirates this week, co-authored a book in 2009 documenting how this strategy had fueled corruption and failed to achieve its stated purpose.
Once in power, however, Ghani continued down the same road.
The situation that the US confronted in Afghanistan was even worse than is typical for aspiring nation builders.
From the very beginning, the Afghan population perceived the US presence as a foreign operation intended to weaken their society.
That was not a bargain they wanted.
What happens when top-down state-building efforts are proceeding against a society’s wishes?
In many places, the only attractive option is to withdraw.
Sometimes, this takes the form of a physical exodus, as James C. Scott shows in The Art of Not Being Governed, his study of the Zomia people in Southeast Asia.
Or it could mean co-habitation without cooperation, as in the case of Scots in Britain or Catalans in Spain.
But in a fiercely independent, well-armed society with a long tradition of blood feuds and a recent history of civil war, the more likely response is violent conflict.
Perhaps things could have turned out differently if Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency had not supported the Taliban when it was militarily defeated, if NATO drone attacks had not further alienated the population, and if US-backed Afghan elites had not been extravagantly corrupt.
But the cards were stacked against America’s state-first strategy.
And the fact is, US leaders should have known better.
As Melissa Dell and Pablo Querubín document, America adopted a similar top-down strategy in Vietnam, and it backfired spectacularly.
Places that were bombed to subdue the Viet Cong became even more supportive of the anti-American insurgency.
Even more telling is the US military’s own recent experience in Iraq.
As research by Eli Berman, Jacob Shapiro, and Joseph Felter shows, the “surge” there worked much better when Americans tried to win hearts and minds by cultivating the support of local groups.
Similarly, my own work with Ali Cheema, Asim Khwaja, and James Robinson finds that in rural Pakistan, people turn to non-state actors precisely when they think state institutions are ineffective and foreign to them.
None of this means that the withdrawal could not have been managed better.
But after 20 years of misguided efforts, the US was destined to fail in its twin objectives of withdrawing from Afghanistan and leaving behind a stable, law-based society.
The result is an immense human tragedy.
Even if the Taliban do not revert to their worst practices, Afghan men and especially women will pay a high price for America’s failures in the years and decades ahead.

The Russians are Coming – With Cash
MOSCOW – Russia’s government is sitting on a giant pile of cash that it plans to invest in foreign assets.
The glimpse of its economic muscle was revealed this week when the Prime Minister of Iceland announced that Russia may come with about $5 billion to save its troubled economy.
Who could have thought that, given the chaotic Russia of the 1990’s, only ten years later it would be in the position to bail out a developed country?
Even more surprising is the fact that the helping hand for Iceland comes at a time when the domestic stock market is in a free fall and trading on the Moscow stock exchange is routinely halted.
The Kremlin thinks that now is the time to buy assets cheaply, using the current financial crisis to emerge as a powerful global economic player.
As Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remarked at a recent meeting with the CEO of state-owned bank VTB, “Perhaps we should buy something [abroad]?
Something that is up for grabs?”
According to Arkady Dvorkovich, an economic aide to President Dmitry Medvedev, the government will support – both diplomatically and financially – the expansion of Russian companies abroad.
Following the Russian-Georgian war, the West is scared that Russia’s government will use its cash not just for economic purposes, but as an aggressive foreign policy tool.
Should the West really consider blocking Russian investments abroad as a way to influence Russia?
Trying to erect an Iron Curtain around Russian funds and businesses will prove counterproductive.
Indeed, a large-scale “invasion” of Russian business would be a positive development, because it would foster economic interdependence.
This is true even if the economic expansion is led by state-owned companies and by Russian sovereign wealth funds.
By investing in American and European assets, Russia’s government and business elites are buying a stake in the global economy.
This should bring better mutual understanding and a more rational and accountable foreign policy.
Paradoxically, despite recent hits to the Russian stock market, Russia remains awash with cash.
Russia’s government just rolled out a $130 billion bailout plan for the country’s banking system; as a percentage of GDP this would be equivalent to about $1.3 trillion in the US – almost double the Paulson plan.
Yet, even this package has not significantly eaten into Russia’s sovereign wealth funds and its world’s third largest currency reserves.
The government’s Reserve Fund, created to cushion the economy from a fall in oil prices, stands at $140 billion, and the National Welfare Fund, intended mainly to solve the coming pension crisis, holds another $30 billion.
The NWF, though not yet officially a “sovereign wealth fund,” is already among the 10 largest such funds, rivaling the Brunei Investment Agency.
A combined Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund (excluding the half-trillion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves) would rival Singapore’s Temasek Holdings (currently sixth in the world) and lag just behind the China Investment Corporation.
By design, these funds are intended to be invested outside Russia.
As today’s financial crisis has made many Western assets cheap, they are now within reach of Russia’s government and leading Russian companies.
Russian private and state-owned companies have already invested abroad extensively, often buying stakes in large foreign companies.
Overall, the top 25 Russian companies hold $59 billion in foreign assets and are the third largest investors in emerging economies, following Hong Kong and Brazil.
Even though the financial crisis has wiped out Russian stock market, some of the best-run companies are hit less badly than their Western counterparts and will therefore be shopping in the global market next year.
Russian corporations’ foreign investments have already generated a heated debate in both the United States and Europe – even when investment was done by a private company.
The largest controversy surrounded a merger that Russian steel giant SeverStal sought with Luxemburg-based Arcelor.
SeverStal was rejected in favor of Mittal Steel, with some commentators claiming that the decision was taken on political grounds.
But no investment by a private Russian company has, so far, been vetoed by Western governments.
Yet hostility towards investment by Russia’s government (and government companies) has been almost universal until recently.
US and European policymakers do not trust that foreign governments (and their sovereign wealth funds) invest solely on business grounds.
But the financial crisis is making the West happy to find “friends with cash.”
During his visit to Russia in June, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson emphasized that the US is interested in welcoming Russian investment, including investment by Russia’s sovereign wealth funds.
But Russia’s government still needs to set up a transparent and accountable structure to manage its sovereign wealth.
Doing so will also help to convince other countries that the government’s agenda is economic, not political.
Russian authorities may be advancing that goal by taking initial steps toward improving corporate governance in state-owned companies.
In an unprecedented move, the government replaced a large number of bureaucrats on the boards of these companies with independent directors (including a couple of foreigners).
While it is unlikely that Russian sovereign wealth funds and state-owned companies will change overnight, they will certainly become more transparent and efficient in the near future.
The key benefit of Russian foreign investment is not economic, but that it helps Russia become a global citizen.
Consider Russia’s elites, who buy houses in London, ski in the Alps, and educate their children in Switzerland. They have too much to lose from a worsening political climate between Russia and the West.
It is time to make Russia’s big business – and its government – stakeholders in the world economy.

Reimagining the Office
BOSTON – Last month, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the company would allow its employees, currently working from home in accordance with social-distancing protocols, to stay there for good.
Several other big businesses – from Facebook to the French automaker PSA – have followed suit with plans to keep far more employees at home after the COVID-19 crisis ends.
Will the office be yet another casualty of the pandemic?
In a sense, the death of the office has been a long time coming.
In the 1960s, American futurist Melvin Webber predicted that the world would reach a “post-city age,” in which “it might be possible to locate on a mountain top and to maintain intimate, real-time, and realistic contact with business or other associates.”
During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, the rise of Internet-based companies made that future seem closer than ever. As the British journalist Frances Cairncross put it in 1997, the Internet meant the “death of distance.”
Once distance doesn’t matter, the logic goes, offices – and, by extension, cities – become irrelevant.
It may seem like we are reaching this point.
From newscasters to office workers, jobs once thought to necessitate a shared workplace are being performed from home during the pandemic.
And yet anyone who has been on a group Zoom call knows that, despite advances in communication technologies, engaging with colleagues remotely often remains far more difficult than meeting face to face.
The problem runs deeper than time lags or toddler interruptions.
As the sociologist Mark Granovetter argued in 1973, functioning societies are underpinned not only by “strong ties” (close relationships), but also by “weak ties” (casual acquaintances).
Whereas strong ties tend to form dense, overlapping networks – our close friends are often close friends with one another – weak ties connect us to a larger and more diverse group of people.
By bridging different social circles, weak ties are more likely to connect us with new ideas and perspectives, challenging our preconceptions and fostering innovation and its diffusion.
And while video-chatting or social media may help us to maintain our strong ties, it is unlikely to produce new ones, let alone connect us with as many people from outside our social circles: baristas, fellow train passengers, colleagues with whom we don’t work directly, and so on.
An analysis of data from MIT students, professors, and administrators during the pandemic seems to bear this out.
My colleagues and I built two models of the same communication network – one showing interactions before the campus was closed, and the other showing interactions during the shutdown.
Initial results – which will still need additional validation and peer review – indicate that interactions are narrowing, with people exchanging more messages within a smaller pool of contacts.
In short, existing strong ties are deepening, while weak ties falter.
Perhaps in the future, it will be possible to mimic physical serendipity and form weak ties online.
But, for now, online platforms appear ill-equipped to do so.
On the contrary, they often actively filter out unknown individuals or opposing ideas – a function that was fueling political polarization even before the pandemic.
As a result, our lockdown-enforced social bubbles are increasingly opaque.
Shared physical spaces seem to be the only antidote to this fragmentation.
Offices, which facilitate deeper interactions among diverse acquaintances, can be a particularly powerful corrective.
And yet demand for shared spaces seems unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels.
Companies like Twitter that do not see productivity fall will be eager to lower overhead costs.
As for employees, it was never going to take long to get used to living without long commutes, strict corporate schedules, and uncomfortable office attire.
This will have far-reaching implications.
Even a 10% reduction in demand for office space could cause property values to plummet.
But while this would be bad news for developers, designers, and real-estate agents, it could also ease the economic pressures behind urban gentrification.
In any case, companies would be well-advised not to eschew offices entirely, both for their own sake – new, innovative, and collaborative ideas are essential to success – and for the wellbeing of the societies in which they operate.
Instead, they can allow employees to stay home more often, while taking steps to ensure that the time people do spend in the office is conducive to establishing weak ties.
This could mean, for example, transforming traditional floor plans, designed to facilitate solitary task execution, into more open, dynamic spaces, which encourage the so-called cafeteria effect. (Nowhere is it easier to establish weak ties than while eating lunch in a cafeteria.)
More radical redesigns may follow, with designers finding ways to generate serendipity, such as through choreographed, “event-based” spaces.
The COVID-19 crisis has shown that we have the tools to stay connected from a mountaintop – or our kitchen table, for that matter.
Our challenge today is to leverage physical space so that we may regularly descend from our isolated summits.
That means pursuing the rebirth of the office in a form that enhances its greatest asset: the ability to nurture all the ties that bind.

Mexico's Labyrinth of Uncertainty
What makes countries grow is perhaps the most fascinating issue in economics, and one of tremendous political-indeed, geopolitical-importance as well.
In pondering this question, the case of Mexico-neither an economic tiger like China or Singapore nor a sluggard like many African and Carribean countries-may be especially instructive.
On a recent trip to Mexico I spoke to many Mexicans about the state of their economy and about their hopes for the future.
I asked about their long-term expectations, and about their thoughts concerning Mexico's economic prospects in the decades ahead.
What I heard suggested that the dominant feeling for most Mexicans is one of a great uncertainty about their future-perhaps the very uncertainty at the root of our imperfect knowledge about growth in general.
Mexicans seem to believe that they could be living at close to US living standards in another few decades.
But they find it equally likely that their living standards might drop even lower than they are today.
This mixture of optimism and fear applies to everyone, Mexican businesses and Mexican families alike.
People do have strong reasons to be optimistic.
The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, the US, and Canada helped Mexico's economy recover quickly from the 1994-95 peso crisis.
Indeed, NAFTA membership has proven to be so popular that Mexico's government has forged many other free trade agreements, including one with the EU in 2000.
So Mexico's current economic slowdown appears to reflect nothing more than weak global conditions.
In fact, the economy has shown signs of recovery recently.
If these are sustained, Mexico should soon find itself on a solid upward path.
Once again, Mexicans can thank NAFTA for the quick recovery.
True, NAFTA is only an economic-not a political - union, and no symbolic gesture like the creation of a common currency is contemplated.
But the obvious advantages of economic integration with the prosperous US are no less important to Mexico's economic stability and development than accession to the EU is for countries like Poland, Latvia, or Slovakia.
Indeed, the most important benefit of NAFTA for Mexico is that it represents a long-term commitment among the three member countries to work together.
With over 20 million Mexicans in the US already, and with Hispanic voters so potent a political force that President Bush makes a show of speaking Spanish, that commitment appears genuine.
But alongside those strong grounds for optimism are significant worries.
As Pedro Aspe, a much-admired former finance minister, emphasized to me, NAFTA did give a sudden boost to Mexico's economy at the outset. Labor productivity soared, as Mexicans were forced to adapt to the rules of the US economy in order to compete.
But that improvement appears to have been only a so-called "impact effect."
Mexican productivity growth has since fallen back to its levels in the 1980's.
Mexicans also point to their economy's disappointing growth on a per capita basis since 1982.
Twenty years is a long time to have almost no economic growth.
It was also a time when many Mexicans were abandoning their economy and leaving to work in the US. The situation would have been even worse had this safety valve not been in place
Meanwhile, China, a country with more than ten times Mexico's population, managed to grow spectacularly in this period.
Why, Mexicans ask, should their country's growth have been so disappointing-and this just as they were establishing free-market institutions, privatizing assets, and developing a more robust democracy?
China's one-child policy must have been an advantage for its per capita GDP growth, allowing more time to be spent on business activities rather than childrearing.
But Mexico has recently also shown a sharp decline in population growth rates, as Mexican women opt for more birth control and smaller families.
Mexicans' obsession with China is no accident.
China's much lower labor costs mean that Mexican jobs and income levels are directly at risk.
Mexican autoworkers earn three times as much as Chinese autoworkers.
So Mexico's auto industry must make huge advances in productivity if it is to maintain the same wage level in the future.
Part of Mexico's problem is due to suffering two major financial crises since 1982: the Less-Developed-Country Debt crisis of the early 1980's and the peso crisis of 1994-95.
Both were random hits generated by sudden shifts in investor confidence; both represented big setbacks that required years to recover from fully.
Worse, no one can be sure that such setbacks will not occur again.
Confidence crises beget the risk of further confidence crises.
More political and legal change is needed if confidence is to have a more solid footing.
For example, corruption in all economic sectors-as well as government and labor unions-impedes growth by destroying trust.
This means that personal and family connections mean a lot more in Mexican business than they do elsewhere, which prevents people from moving freely through the economy to exploit their personal talents.
Mexicans generally do not want to go to college abroad because they would miss opportunities to form the necessary bonds with other Mexicans.
But if corruption were reduced and social trust strengthened, such inhibitions would become irrelevant, and investor confidence would rise.
Moreover, though Mexico elected its first president, Vicente Fox, from an opposition party after 71 years of one-party rule, this new democratic government appears ineffective.
No party has a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Political bickering seems to take priority over action.
Disaffection with an ineffective government might lead voters to acquiesce in a more authoritarian government.
Little wonder, then, that Mexicans express fundamental uncertainty about where their country is heading.
That uncertainty will be a major factor in how Mexico's economy does or does not develop.

The Dialectic of Global Trade Policy
MUNICH – There is a subtle yet important change occurring in how political leaders think about international trade, including how to remedy long-standing problems.
It results from a key distinction between the “what” of trade (where there is relatively broad-based agreement among countries) and the “how” (where differences have tended to undermine important relationships, whether transatlantic or between China and the world’s advanced countries).
As a result, there is some room for greater optimism than is suggested by talk of damaging trade wars, stifling investment restrictions, technological conflicts, and multiplying great-power tensions.
The relatively wide agreement in the international trade area tends to focus on four main hypotheses that are supported by a body of research and evidence:
First, free and fair trade is in the interest of most people in most countries, but it is not sufficient for inclusive prosperity.
Specific segments of society can be displaced, marginalized, and alienated.
As such, trade is not just an economic issue.
It also entails important institutional, political, and social dimensions.
Second, trade is inherently underpinned by a mutually beneficial set of voluntary interactions that are best conducted, to use the language of game theory, as a cooperative game.
Third, an accumulation of legitimate grievances undermines both the ideal and reality of free and fair trade.
These grievances relate mostly to what economists call non-tariff barriers, including issues such as intellectual property theft, the weaponization of economic and development tools, forced technology transfer, insufficiently effective and credible multilateral institutions, and a less-than-stable global economic and financial order.
Lastly, fixing these problems has proven frustratingly slow.
That is where the major areas of disagreement begin.
How should the accumulating set of problems that undermine free and fair trade be addressed?
Over the years, conventional wisdom has stressed that the best option is to maintain an approach focused on cooperative resolution.
This implies negotiations that are best conducted free of actual or threatened punishment such as tariff imposition, and it favors reliance on the rules-based framework established by existing multilateral institutions.
The other approach is that adopted by the US President Donald Trump’s administration.
Noting that past efforts to reverse the growth of non-tariff barriers have not worked and will not work, this strategy is more open to the use of tariff penalties to influence behavior modification, and the threat of escalation in response to any and all retaliation by trading partners.
First widely dismissed as an unfortunate policy pivot, more people now are beginning to wonder whether the new US approach – provided it’s not used repeatedly – could in fact serve as a beneficial disruption that helps reset international trade relationships and place them on a firmer footing.
It’s a view that is underpinned by evidence (the shift from retaliation to resolution by such countries as Canada, South Korea, and Mexico) and the prospect that, due to its limited options, China will have no choice but to do the same by addressing some of its non-tariff barriers.
The task for the international community is to take advantage of the emerging window to move more comprehensively on implementing measures to counter slowing growth, reduce the risk of financial instability, and ensure more inclusive prosperity.
Such measures are less a problem of engineering (in the sense that most economists agree on what’s needed) than of politics (the need for decisive leadership and sustainability).
For starters, domestic pro-growth policies must be re-energized, both as an urgent standalone priority and to take pressure off trade.
This is particularly important for China and countries in Europe, including six of the EU’s largest economies.
The focus must be on productivity enhancement, structural changes to respond better to the realities of the global economy of today and tomorrow, more effective safety nets for the most vulnerable and displaced segments of society, and addressing market and government failures that frustrate growth and investment.
Moreover, existing trade arrangements need to be modernized, not only to fix existing problems, but also as part of a broader effort to enhance these arrangements’ agility in the face of rapid technological change.
Particular attention needs to be devoted to improving the approach to big data, technology transfer, digital infrastructure, artificial intelligence, networks, and mobility.
It will be no less crucial to continue reforming the multilateral institutions in order to enhance their effectiveness and credibility.
Finally, the international community must guard against regional arrangements, such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which are intended to promote development but can end up undermining partner countries.
This requires steps to enhance transparency on the terms and conditions of projects and debt undertaken through such initiatives, encourage greater reliance on local labor, and ensure that recipient countries are not encumbered with excessive liabilities.
Excessively one-sided debt-for-physical-assets swaps, which can also raise genuine national security concerns, must also be resisted.
It is often said that with risk comes opportunity.
What initially was viewed as an unfortunate US shift to protectionism may in fact have opened a window to improve the functioning of the global economy and world trade.
The next few months will be critical.

Colombia at Peace?
BOGOTÁ – The Framework Agreement for the End of the Armed Conflict in Colombia that has just been announced by President Juan Manuel Santos is a historic landmark for his country and all of Latin America.
It is also a tribute to diplomatic resourcefulness and negotiating skill.
The agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as the FARC, came after long years of failed attempts by Colombian governments of all political shades to reach an accommodation with the last, and among the most odious, guerrilla movement to have operated in Latin America.
Never before has the FARC – a monumental apparatus of terror, mass murder, and drug trafficking – agreed to discuss disarmament, its fighters’ social and political reintegration, victims’ rights, an end to drug production, and participation in “truth and responsibility” commissions to examine the crimes committed during a half-century of conflict.
But now it has.
This momentous shift reflects the decimation of the FARC following long years of struggle, the resilience of Colombian society, and, perhaps most important, Santos’s brilliant regional policy.
By weakening the so-called Bolivarian Axis (Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia), the FARC guerrillas were left without a supportive regional environment.
As with peace processes in the Middle East and Central America following the Cold War’s end, regional changes created the conditions for the start of the Colombian process.
But, in the Middle East and Central America, external actors – the United States and the Soviet Union – produced the change; in the case of the Colombian process, the change came from within.
Prior to engaging the FARC in secret talks in Cuba, Santos’s regional diplomacy shifted the region’s politics from saber rattling to the hard work of cooperation.
He turned Venezuela and Ecuador, which had long been safe havens for the FARC, into friendly neighbors willing to bring an end to the archaic tradition of revolutionary wars.
In fact, in what is perhaps the most remarkable diplomatic turnaround, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has become a key facilitator in the resolution of the Colombian conflict.
The talks with the FARC evolved as regional détente was followed by an ambitious initiative to address the root causes of the Colombian conflict.
Most notably, Santos signed the Victims and Land Restitution Law in June 2011, in the presence of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
The law provides reparation for the victims of human-rights violations in the course of a 60-year conflict, as well as restitution of millions of hectares stolen from peasants.
The law thus puts Colombia on a path to peace by blunting the FARC’s appeal to land reform to justify its untold atrocities.
The law is undeniably complex, and by no means without shortcomings.
But, if implemented as planned, it could bring about a profound social revolution.
It also represents a novel approach to peace, given that such laws are normally introduced only after a conflict has ended.
In this case, returning land to dispossessed peasants and offering financial reparation to the victims and those who were displaced by the conflict became the way to peace.
Indeed, it was none other than Alfonso Cano, a former FARC leader, who called the law “essential to a future of reconciliation” and a “contribution to a real solution to the conflict.”
Skeptics and opponents of the negotiations do have a case, however.
The FARC’s record in previous peace talks reveals a penchant for manipulating negotiations to gain national and international legitimacy without actually being willing to strike a deal.
Santos could, therefore, have been tempted to choose the Sri Lanka way – a ruthless military onslaught to defeat the insurgents, at the price of major human-rights violations and the destruction of civilian communities.
Instead, Santos opted for the path of least expedience.
After all, war, in Colombia and elsewhere, frequently unites nations, while peace divides them.
The repercussions of a genuine end to the Colombian armed conflict would be felt far beyond the country’s borders.
If Chávez’s Venezuela has become a narco-state in which the regime’s acolytes are drug lords, this reflects their privileged relations with the FARC.
Repercussions would also be felt in Mexico, where drug cartels are tearing apart the country, and the US, the world’s largest source of demand.
West Africa, too, would be affected, having become in recent years the main transit point for South American drugs headed to Europe.
Formidable difficulties still lie ahead, and a final agreement is by no means certain.
But Santos nonetheless has a fair chance of burying, once and for all, the specious mystique of violent revolutionary change that has held back Latin America’s political and economic modernization for so long.

No Time for a Trade War
NEW YORK – The battle with the United States over China’s exchange rate continues.
When the Great Recession began, many worried that protectionism would rear its ugly head.
True, G-20 leaders promised that they had learned the lessons of the Great Depression.
But 17 of the G-20’s members introduced protectionist measures just months after the first summit in November 2008.
The “Buy American” provision in the United States’ stimulus bill got the most attention.
Still, protectionism was contained, partly due to the World Trade Organization.
Continuing economic weakness in the advanced economies risks a new round of protectionism.
In America, for example, more than one in six workers who would like a full-time job can’t find one.
These were among the risks associated with America’s insufficient stimulus, which was designed to placate members of Congress as much as it was to revive the economy.
With soaring deficits, a second stimulus appears unlikely, and, with monetary policy at its limits and inflation hawks being barely kept at bay, there is little hope of help from that department, either.
So protectionism is taking pride of place.
The US Treasury has been charged by Congress to assess whether China is a “currency manipulator.”
Although President Obama has now delayed for some months when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner must issue his report, the very concept of “currency manipulation” itself is flawed: all governments take actions that directly or indirectly affect the exchange rate.
Reckless budget deficits can lead to a weak currency; so can low interest rates.
Until the recent crisis in Greece, the US benefited from a weak dollar/euro exchange rate.
Should Europeans have accused the US of “manipulating” the exchange rate to expand exports at its expense?
Although US politicians focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China – which is persistently large – what matters is the multilateral balance.
When demands for China to adjust its exchange rate began during George W. Bush’s administration, its multilateral trade surplus was small.
More recently, however, China has been running a large multilateral surplus as well.
Saudi Arabia also has a bilateral and multilateral surplus: Americans want its oil, and Saudis want fewer US products.
Even in absolute value, Saudi Arabia’s multilateral merchandise surplus of $212 billion in 2008 dwarfs China’s $175 billion surplus; as a percentage of GDP, Saudi Arabia’s current-account surplus, at 11.5% of GDP, is more than twice that of China.
Saudi Arabia’s surplus would be far higher were it not for US armaments exports.
In a global economy with deficient aggregate demand, current-account surpluses are a problem.
But China’s current-account surplus is actually less than the combined figure for Japan and Germany; as a percentage of GDP, it is 5%, compared to Germany’s 5.2%.
Many factors other than exchange rates affect a country’s trade balance. A key determinant is national savings.
America’s multilateral trade deficit will not be significantly narrowed until America saves significantly more; while the Great Recession induced higher household savings (which were near zero), this has been more than offset by the increased government deficits.
Adjustment in the exchange rate is likely simply to shift to where America buys its textiles and apparel – from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka, rather than China.
Meanwhile, an increase in the exchange rate is likely to contribute to inequality in China, as its poor farmers face increasing competition from America’s highly subsidized farms.
This is the real trade distortion in the global economy – one in which millions of poor people in developing countries are hurt as America helps some of the world’s richest farmers.
During the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the renminbi’s stability played an important role in stabilizing the region.
So, too, the renminbi’s stability has helped the region maintain strong growth, from which the world as a whole benefits.
Some argue that China needs to adjust its exchange rate to prevent inflation or bubbles.
Inflation remains contained, but, more to the point, China’s government has an arsenal of other weapons (from taxes on capital inflows and capital-gains taxes to a variety of monetary instruments) at its disposal.
But exchange rates do affect the pattern of growth, and it is in China’s own interest to restructure and move away from high dependence on export-led growth.
China recognizes that its currency needs to appreciate over the long run, and politicizing the speed at which it does so has been counterproductive.
(Since it began revaluing its exchange rate in July 2005, the adjustment has been half or more of what most experts think is required.)
Moreover, starting a bilateral confrontation is unwise.
Since China’s multilateral surplus is the economic issue and many countries are concerned about it, the US should seek a multilateral, rules-based solution.
Imposing unilateral duties after unilaterally labeling China a “currency manipulator” would undermine the multilateral system, with little payoff.
China might respond by imposing duties on those American products effectively directly or indirectly subsidized by America’s massive bailouts of its banks and car companies.
No one wins from a trade war.
So America should be wary of igniting one in the midst of an uncertain global recovery – as popular as it might be with politicians whose constituents are justly concerned about high unemployment, and as easy as it is to look for blame elsewhere.
Unfortunately, this global crisis was made in America, and America must look inward, not only to revive its economy, but also to prevent a recurrence.

The End of Fiscal Sovereignty in Europe
MILAN – The late Milton Friedman said that a common currency – that is, a monetary union – cannot be sustained without a deep form of economic and political union. By this, he meant an open economy that ensures the free flow of goods, labor, and capital, together with a disciplined central fiscal authority and a strong central bank.
The latter two are pillars of a strong currency.
They work in tandem.
But the other pieces are no less important.
The eurozone, currently wrestling with fiscal imbalance and sovereign debt risk, has a strong and autonomous central bank, but is fiscally fragmented and only partly unified politically.
Enter the Maastricht Treaty, which in theory imposes fiscal discipline by placing limits on government deficits and debt levels – clearly a structure designed to prevent free riding on the fiscal discipline of others.
Maastricht was thus intended to prevent a situation like the current one in Greece.
It didn’t work.
Eurozone sovereign debt turned out not to be homogenous with respect to risk.
In a stable world, Maastricht Treaty’s rules-based framework, if enforced, might do the job.
But in a shock-prone world, it is a fragile system, because it precludes anything but modest countercyclical policy.
No wonder, then, that the treaty’s strict limits were breached early in the euro’s first decade bycore countries as well as peripheral ones.
Indeed, with a large shock, much of the breach happens automatically, as tax revenues shrink and social-insurance payments expand.
Recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund suggests that as much as 80% of the fiscal stimulus in advanced countries during the current crisis is non-discretionary.
That kind of built-in counter-cyclicality is not a bad thing.
But if it produces the threat of fiscal instability and excessive sovereign-debt risk after a large shock, then the starting point was not sufficiently conservative – in other words, deficits or debt levels (or both) were too high.
Counter-cyclicality does not mean running modest deficits in the good times and huge deficits in major downturns.
If the current EU budget rules are too rigid and are ignored in the face of a shock, then the door is open for imprudent fiscal behavior.
In theory, strict in-depth monitoring could distinguish genuinely prudent countercyclical responses from profligacy.
But in practice it is hard to enforce.
The eurozone’s immediate challenge is declining fiscal stability in a subset of countries whose credit ratings are falling and debt-service costs rising.
Absent external assistance and a credible plan for restoring fiscal order, Greek sovereign debt could not be rolled over, forcing a default, probably in the form of a restructuring of Greek debt.
Even with external assistance, many view default as a near certainty, because the arithmetic of restoring fiscal balance is so daunting.
Eurozone membership precludes inflation and devaluation as adjustment mechanisms.
An alternative is domestic deflation combined with extreme fiscal tightening – that is, a period of slow or negative growth in wages, incomes, and some prices of non-traded goods.
But deflation is painful and cannot realistically be pursued for political reasons.
The constraints for eurozone countries are similar to those of a state in America that gets into fiscal trouble.
Devaluation is not an option because of the common currency.
The Federal Reserve will not willingly resort to inflation.
Moreover, in the United States, there are rules and conventions (similar to Maastricht) that disallow or discourage states from running long-term deficits.
This means that state fiscal behavior tends to be pro-cyclical in the face of large shocks like the recent one.
So why isn’t a federal system equally fragile?
There are two key safety valves.
One is the central government’s ability to run deficits and to act decisively.
The other is labor mobility.
The EU does not have a robust centralized fiscal structure with a counter-cyclical mandate.
And labor mobility, a long-run goal in the EU, is constrained by language, laws, and diverse regulatory regimes.
In addition, state bonds are not treated as equals, and the markets penalize profligate states.
If the EU wants a monetary union in which sovereign debt is relatively homogenous with respect to risk, fiscal discipline must be similarly homogenous.
But that also means that it will need a more robust mechanism for countercyclical responses to shocks.
The EU’s leaders recently stated their intention to revisit the Maastricht structure, which in principle is a good idea.
They might take the route of adapting the Maastricht rules to allow for more inter-temporal flexibility at the national level.
But that approach would be complicated.
One would need a sophisticated capability for monitoring and enforcing fiscal policy and sovereign debt – or else end up with a repeat of the current situation.
A better long-term solution is a central EU fiscal capacity that accumulates the resources to respond to shocks during periods of growth.
One could think of it as a stabilization tax that becomes negative in downturns.
But a move in this direction does involve some degree of fiscal centralization. And it probably would require that the EU be able to issue sovereign debt.
It is unclear whether there is the political will to do all that.
But a step in the right direction could be taken by partial fiscal centralization with a limited countercyclical mandate.
That would enable effective enforcement of fiscal discipline at the national level and provide the euro with the fiscal discipline it needs to survive.
When the eurozone was created, it was widely understood that fiscal discipline was a crucial underpinning.
The current crisis vividly underscores the point.
The challenge now is to achieve a combination of discipline and flexibility that protects the collective interest.
That will involve a loss of full fiscal sovereignty, but facing up to that reality is required to sustain the monetary union.

Hot Rocks
CANBERRA – Ask any power system engineer about renewable energy and you are likely to be told that it doesn’t deliver “base-load” power.
In other words, renewable energy can’t be relied upon to provide power 24 hours a day, seven days a week: wind doesn’t always spin the turbines on the hill, the sun cannot shine on solar power stations at night, and even hydroelectricity can run short if the rains don’t come.
The inherently erratic behavior of the major renewable energy technologies presents serious problems for power system planners.
It limits how much of these types of renewable power can usefully be fed into the world’s electricity grids.
After all, consumers expect power always to be available.
The engineering solution is to keep a large amount of reliable base-load power as a major component of the generating mix and supplement this with “peaking plants” that can be brought on-line when needs arise.
This peaking capacity is built around hydroelectric systems in some countries, but usually it is based on burning fossil fuels such as gas, diesel, or fuel oils.
The base-load power, too, is predominantly based on fossil fuels, with around 39% of global electricity generation sourced from burning coal.
In some countries, nuclear power has been seen as an answer, but deposits of high-grade nuclear fuel worldwide appear to be limited, and the long-term costs of waste storage and plant decommissioning are high.
The challenge, then, is to reduce our current reliance on fossil and nuclear fuels for base-load power.
The answer may be under our feet.
Earth is an extraordinarily hot planet.
Six thousand kilometers below the surface, the planet’s core is as hot as the surface of the sun.
Yet, even at shallow depths, useful temperatures for power generation are often available.
This “conventional” geothermal energy has been used to generate reliable base-load electricity for more than 100 years, and is now used in many countries including Italy, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, and the western United States.
The technology is well established, and the track record of reliable power generation includes more than 9000 megawatts of generating capacity.
But conventional geothermal power requires a natural source of large quantities of steam or hot water, and such sources are usually found only in volcanic regions, which rules out its use in large parts of the world.
More tantalizing for humanity’s need for widely available, clean base-load power is the non-conventional geothermal energy called “hot dry rocks,” or HDR.
With HDR, useful heat is present in rocks only a few kilometers below the Earth’s surface.
But, with no natural steam or hot water to bring the energy to the surface, an engineered solution is needed, and, during the past 35 years, more than $600 million has been spent worldwide devising one.
The concept is beguilingly simple: drill at least two boreholes five kilometers deep, inject cold water into one, pass it through the hot rocks, and then bring it back to the surface, where the energy is removed in a power station.
Then re-inject the now cooled water for another pass through the subsurface.
Only the heat is extracted at the surface, and everything else that is brought up to the surface is re-injected again, eliminating waste.
But it is the economics of HDR geothermal that will eventually determine its long-term role, because deep boreholes are expensive to drill, and their costs must be met before power stations can begin to generate electricity.
The shallower the heat resources and the cheaper the capital, the more competitive an HDR project will be.
The rising costs of fossil and fissile fuels will also make HDR more compelling, since the long-term economics of geothermal power is effectively quarantined from fuel price movements.
Deposits of hot dry rocks are common, and large amounts of heat are within reach in many places.
But the science and engineering of HDR has been challenging, and it is only now that the first power stations are emerging.
A small power station is operating in Landau, Germany, and others are under construction in France and Australia.
These first power stations will develop the operational and financial performance histories that will be necessary before HDR geothermal energy can begin making an impact on world energy supplies.
Re-engineering humanity’s power systems is going to be an expensive undertaking, regardless of what mix of technologies are used, and the chosen systems will have to be reliable and widely available.
The road to HDR geothermal energy has been long and expensive, but, like all developing technologies, the basic research and development had to be done before commercial development could follow.
With power stations now being built, the signs are bright for widespread use of geothermal energy to generate clean, emissions-free base-load power.

Africa’s Diaspora to the Rescue
DAKAR – There is something dismally familiar about the tide of news reports concerning Africa’s increased suffering – more poverty, malnutrition, civil strife, and death – in the face of the recent global financial crisis.
Almost everywhere, the media translates academic conclusions into graphic illustrations of brutality and despair in places such as Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But there is another, woefully under-reported, side to the story.
African countries that were locked out of international capital markets for most of the past five decades have largely been spared the twin woes of financial turmoil and economic downturn.
The continent’s economies experienced a slowdown, but not a recession.
Indeed, according to McKinsey & Company, Africa was the third-largest contributor to world economic growth in 2009, after China and India.
Moreover, several African countries have received ratings from credit agencies, which has opened up global financial centers to them.
In some cases, these ratings have proved equivalent to or higher than those of countries such as Turkey or Argentina.
Stock exchanges are being established across the continent.
Furthermore, countries such as China, India, and Brazil has provided a platform for increased exports and the inception of a model of cooperation based on trade, investment, and technology transfer, rather than “aid.”
China-Africa trade alone increased from $10 billion in 2000 to $107 billion in 2008, and billions of dollars are being invested in oil production, mining, transportation, electricity generation and transmission, telecommunications, and other infrastructure.
These developments have combined to improve African countries’ macroeconomic performance dramatically.
Inflation has been halved since the 1990’s, and foreign-exchange reserves have increased 30%.
Public finances showed a 2.8%-of-GDP surplus in 2008, compared to a 1.4%-of-GDP deficit in 2000-2005.
Savings rates are between 10% and 20%, and external debt has decreased from 110% of GDP in 2005 to 21% in 2008.
Since 2000, sub-Saharan African countries have achieved economic growth of 5-7%.
Many factors have contributed to this upturn.
Emerging-market demand has pushed up commodity prices.
Urbanization has given rise to a dynamic informal sector.
Improved governance, higher food production, increased inter-regional trade, debt cancellation, better use of official development assistance (ODA), and thriving telecommunications and housing markets have helped as well.
But transfers from the African diaspora stand out as the most significant contributing factor.
A study commissioned by the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development indicates that more than 30 million individuals living outside their countries of origin contribute more than $40 billion annually in remittances to their families and communities back home.
For sub-Saharan African countries, remittances increased from $3.1 billion in 1995 to $18.5 billion in 2007, according to the World Bank, representing between 9% and 24% of GDP and 80-750% of ODA.
Migrants’ remittance behavior is essentially dictated by the regulatory environment and the quality – in terms of speed, cost, security, and accessibility – of products and services offered by banks, money-transfer companies, micro-finance institutions, and informal operators.
In this respect, there are three different strategies in place in Africa.
The Anglophone strategy focuses on freeing up the remittance market by encouraging competition, relaxing regulatory constraints for non-bank operators, offering financial incentives, encouraging technical and financial innovation, and stimulating collaboration among market players.
This approach, also adopted by Italy, contributes to reducing costs and increasing the overall volume of funds for beneficiaries.
The Hispanic approach emphasizes migrants’ involvement in banking by offering a range of banking services in both the country of origin and the host country, products of specific interest to migrants, and low commissions on foreign transfers.
This approach, widely developed by Morocco and the Portuguese-speaking world, is epitomized by the zero-commission policy initiated by the Spanish bank Santander and its Moroccan counterpart, Attijariwafa Bank.
Finally, the Francophone approach relies on two types of monopoly.
The first is enjoyed by Western Union, which controls up to 90% of the total formal transfer volume within Africa’s 16-member Franc Zone.
Western Union charges fees as high as 25% on transfers to these countries, compared to an average global benchmark of 5%, and has required that Franc-Zone countries sign exclusivity agreements, thereby preventing foreign-exchange bureaux, post offices, and micro-finance institutions from carrying out money transfers.
The second monopoly is exercised in the banking sector.
France has a veto within the boards of directors of the Franc Zone’s two central banks, while two French commercial banks, BNP-Paribas and Société Générale, exercise a quasi-monopoly on lending programs, mainly centered on short-term trade financing and the needs of governments, public and private companies, and the elite.
All other local banks have adopted the same approach, severely restricting access to financial services for households and entrepreneurs.
Despite the increasing importance of remittances from Italy, Spain, and the United States, the largest share in absolute terms still originates from France.
There is thus a real need in the Franc Zone for a financing institution that would convert migrant remittances into productive investments, thereby generating jobs and wealth, and that would broaden access to banking services, mortgages, insurance products, pension plans, and technical assistance.
Official statistics for 2009 are likely to show that migrants’ remittances fell sharply, as the global recession severely eroded job opportunities abroad.
That makes it all the more important that African countries, many of which have laid a strong groundwork for sustainable growth, have a financial system in place that can leverage remittances effectively as the global economy recovers.

Firewalls to Freedom
NEW YORK – Even the most cold-hearted realists would agree that the failure of Communist censorship played a role in the collapse of the Iron Curtain: Voice of America, the fax machine, rock ‘n’ roll, and the lure of Western capitalism helped to win over the people of the Soviet Bloc.
Today, similar hopes are often vested in the Internet, with high expectations that the wealth of online information might trigger the same kind of censorship failure in contemporary authoritarian states that we saw in Eastern Europe – and with the same results.
Such expectations are not entirely unfounded, because most Internet censorship systems are not perfect.
But, while anybody with a little know-how can figure out how to circumvent, say, the “Great Firewall of China,” Internet filtering is only one layer of Chinese Internet censorship.
It is also supplemented by an increasingly sophisticated system of manipulation and spin.
While the blocking of foreign Web sites was eased during the Olympics, deletion of politically sensitive content from Chinese blogs and chat rooms continued unabated throughout 2008.
Now, a new crackdown against “vulgar” Internet content is being used to clean up politically sensitive writings – including discussion of Charter 08 , a pro-democracy treatise signed by thousands of Chinese who discovered it online.
Contrary to Western expectations, most of this domestic Internet censorship is carried out not by the government's Internet police, but by Chinese Web hosting companies, which are being held legally responsible for what their users publish.
Indeed, the Chinese Internet is evolving and adapting in ways that shore up the regime’s legitimacy.
Hundreds of thousands of people are employed as freelance Web commentators, working to spin discussions in chat rooms and on blogs in a more patriotic, pro-government direction.
Nationalistic young people, proud of China’s newfound global economic and political power, gladly volunteer their time to show off their patriotism on the Internet.
Meanwhile, China is looking to Russia, which may have invented an entirely new model of controlling the Internet without recourse to censorship.
Having established full control of traditional media, the Kremlin is now moving full-speed into the virtual world.
The authorities’ strategy is not new: establish tight control over the leading publishing platforms and fill them with propaganda and spin to shape online public opinion.
The fate of LiveJournal – the most influential blogging platform in Russia, which is often used to express dissent and protest against the government – is one unfortunate example.
In less than three years, this popular online resource has been transformed from a respectable American start-up to a shady Moscow-based enterprise, co-owned by the Kremlin’s favorite oligarchs.
Government propaganda abounds, too, generated by new media operators like Konstantin Rykov, a 29-year-old Duma deputy and the founder of New Media Stars, the Kremlin’s favorite Internet firm.
Whenever manipulation efforts fail, cyber-attacks offer yet another powerful tool to crack down on dissent without triggering public accusations of formal censorship.
This is what happened to a Georgian (known by the screen name cyxymu) who used his blog on LiveJournal to criticize how both governments handled last summer’s war.
A series of cyber-attacks followed, and was so devastating that the entire service – with its millions of other blogs – crashed, forcing LiveJournal administrators to delete his account temporarily.
As contemporary authoritarian regimes learn how to manage and engineer information flows, we must understand that promoting and protecting free speech in places like China and Russia is not a simple matter of “tearing down the wall.”
Given these governments’ complex strategies for regulating what their citizens do online – ranging from establishing effective control of private media and telecoms businesses to allowing people to blow off steam without going too far – we should be more realistic about the true extent of the Internet’s transformational potential.

Jimmy Carter Obama
PARIS – “How many divisions does the Pope have?” Joseph Stalin famously quipped when told to be mindful of the Vatican.
In an updated lesson in realpolitik, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently was happy to count Pope Francis as an ally in opposing American military intervention in Syria.
Presenting himself as the last pillar of respect for international law, Putin offered ethics lessons to the United States – and specifically to President Barack Obama.
With the US-Russian agreement, signed in Geneva on September 14, to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control, Russia has returned to the global scene – and not only because of its nuisance value.
Could Putin one day receive, like Obama before him, a Nobel Peace Prize?
Has not Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who proposed the deal, already entered the pantheon of great Russian diplomats, as the successor of Karl Nesselrode, the Russian envoy to the 1814-1815 Congress of Vienna and to the Congress of Paris in 1856?
Of course, Russian diplomacy has performed extremely well recently, but it does not stand on its own merits alone.
Russia’s diplomats would have gained little without America’s foreign-policy malaise – a victim of Obama’s vacillation and of Americans’ hostility to any new military adventure, however limited its scope – and Europe’s deep internal divisions.
Yes, Russia is emerging from its humiliation following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Heir to an imperial tradition that has shaped its national identity, Russia is resuming in the Middle East a role and status more in tune with the one it had from the Czarist era to Soviet times.
But Russia is no match for the US militarily and no match for China economically, and its soft power is virtually non-existent.
If Russia can provoke America – whether by granting political asylum to the “traitor” Edward Snowden, for example, or by resisting Western diplomacy in the Middle East – it is not because it has become a great power once again, but simply because America is no longer the great power that it once was.
The Syrian crisis has made that plain.
Recent US diplomacy has seemed amateurish and naive.
Obama’s handling of the Syrian crisis increasingly evokes Jimmy Carter’s handling of the Iranian hostage crisis 33 years ago, particularly the failed operation in 1980 to rescue the Americans abducted following the takeover of the US embassy in November 1979.
Then, too, hesitation seemed to prevail over determination, contributing to the failure of the mission.
Carter was a somewhat bland engineer, whereas Obama is a charismatic lawyer.
Yet they seem to share a fundamental indecisiveness in their approach to world affairs.
Carter had difficulty choosing between the muscular line of his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and the more moderate approach of his secretary of state, Cyrus Vance.
By contrast, there are no fundamental disagreements among Obama’s closest foreign-policy advisers – Susan Rice, the national security adviser, Samantha Power, who succeeded Rice as US Ambassador to the United Nations, and Secretary of State John Kerry.
Instead, it is Obama himself who seems to be constantly hesitating.
The divisions are not among his advisers, but within his own mind.
As a good lawyer, Obama weighs the pros and cons, aware that it is impossible to do nothing in the Syrian crisis but remaining viscerally disinclined to leap into any foreign entanglement that would distract attention from his agenda of domestic reform.
More important, he seems to lack a coherent long-term strategic vision of America’s role in the world.
Neither the currently fashionable “Asian pivot” nor the “Russian reset” four years ago constitute the beginning of a grand plan.
In such a context, the return of global realpolitik can only benefit Russia and harm the US, despite America’s many advantages in terms of hard and soft power.
The agreement on Syria’s chemical weapons struck by Russia and the US could one day be remembered as a spectacular breakthrough in the field of arms control.
But it is more likely to be perceived as a grand deception – remembered not for helping Syria’s people, but mainly as a sign of America’s growing international weakness.
In that case, the agreement will not only damage America’s reputation, but will also undermine global stability.
Weakness is weakness, whether one is in Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, or Pyongyang.

Hide the Swastikas
NEW YORK – Not so long ago, the far right in Europe was associated with shabby old men nostalgic for the good old days of order and jackboots.
The far-right political parties in France and Italy, now led by women, were founded by former SS officers, veterans of the collaborationist Vichy government, and other dubious figures who had emerged from the shadows of World War II.
The same goes for the Democrats in Sweden, who won 20.6% of the votes in the most recent election.
Clearly, much has changed in the European post-fascist firmament.
Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, will be the first woman to be Italian prime minister.
Marine Le Pen’s National Rally won 89 seats in the French parliament.
And the Sweden Democrats will have a strong voice in national politics, even though they will stay outside the government.
Not only women, but also young men, usually smartly turned out in tailor-made suits, now set the tone for the European far right.
Moderate conservative parties in Europe have not yet been taken over by extremists, as happened with the Republicans in the United States, but fear of losing votes has driven them further toward the fringe.
This does not mean that we are about to wake up in 1933.
History never repeats itself in the same way.
Meloni is not Mussolini, and there is no Hitler, so far, lurking in the wings.
There are in any case many versions of right-wing extremism.
The same was true of prewar fascism.
Each country has its own history, and its own brand of demagoguery.
Still, all forms of right-wing populism have certain things in common.
The politics of resentment appeals to people who feel left behind and ignored.
In most countries, the deeper one goes into the provinces, the more ill feeling toward the so-called elites one encounters.
Race plays its usual corrosive role in the US.
Many rural white people resent the rise of Black people in public life.
And everywhere, fear and discontent find a ready outlet in hostility toward immigrants.
Then there are those who feel humiliated by a lack of recognition or success: failed writers, third-rate academics, or, increasingly, young men from good families, who can no longer take the privileges of their class for granted.
This explains the rise of what might be called the “frat boy right,” stronger in Europe than the US, and the proclivity for snappy suits.
Far-right parties’ recent electoral successes are frequently seen as a failure of their mainstream rivals, who are widely blamed for a lack of coherence.
One doesn’t know what they really stand for.
This is not entirely fair.
What mainstream parties like Labour in the United Kingdom, or the Democrats in the US, stand for is pretty clear: international institutions, global trade, flexible and generous immigration policies, and so on.
The problem is that this hardly distinguishes them from moderate conservative parties.
President Bill Clinton’s politics didn’t fundamentally differ from those of his predecessor, George H.W. Bush, and the same was true of Tony Blair and David Cameron in the UK, or Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel in Germany.
In Europe during the 1990s and the 2000s, many European governments were formed by coalitions comprising moderate left and moderate right parties.
Rule by technocrats, or political managers, became the norm.
As a result, right-wing populists, such as Donald Trump, exploited a loathing not just of the left, but of the conservative establishment, too.
But there is one good reason why the progressives are even more resented than the conservatives: People hate hypocrisy.
It is, of course, true that a degree of hypocrisy is essential in an open society.
Moral or ideological purism is the enemy of liberal democracy, just as always saying exactly what you think is not a sign of good manners.
But there is a particular kind of left-wing hypocrisy that many people find especially irritating.
The mainstream progressive parties now get most of their votes from relatively well-educated people in large cities, people who travel for their work, speak more than one language, relish cultural diversity, and have a stake in the global economy.
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with their worldview.
Economic globalization lifted many people from poverty.
International cooperation in common institutions is preferable to nationalism and border walls.
And a generous attitude to asylum-seekers and immigrants is humane, culturally enriching, and brings new dynamism to a society.
But not everyone benefits from the liberal world order.
The middle class in Italy is feeling the pinch.
Former industrial workers in the American Midwest are hurting.
People in the French provinces feel marginalized by Paris.
Moderate conservatives tend to take a stern view of such complaints. Stop whining and work harder, they say.
The left-wing reaction is more moralistic.
People who complain about immigrants are denounced as racists.
Those who have doubts about international institutions or global trade are dismissed as xenophobes.
But because the left still pretends to stand up for the underprivileged, this often has a strong ring of self-serving duplicity.
Not only do progressive educated urbanites benefit from the liberal global order, but they also wish to take the moral high ground and lecture those who lack their education or prosperity.
This is one reason why people vote for Le Pen, Meloni, Trump, or the Sweden Democrats.
If educated Londoners favor European Union membership, we will vote for Brexit.
If the “elites” talk about face masks or climate change, we will believe that these are hoaxes cooked up by George Soros or Bill Gates.
This is the vengeance of the slighted, the politics of resentment.
Trump has shown us that the politics of resentment is usually destructive and not conducive to successful government.
Can Meloni and other far-right leaders with the chance to govern do better?
I’m not holding my breath.

Winning the Fight Against Killer Diseases
MAPUTO – One of the greatest successes in development aid in the past decade has been the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
The Global Fund has saved millions of lives and helped countries around the world beat back three epidemic diseases.
Now it is appealing to the world’s governments and the private sector for another three years of funding, with governments set to decide on further financing in early December in Washington, DC.
Back in 2000, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the world’s poorest countries, especially in Africa.
New antiretroviral medicines had been developed and were being used in rich countries, but were too expensive for the poorest. Millions of poor people were dying of AIDS, even though the new medicines could have kept them alive.
Two other major killer diseases, malaria and TB, were also resurgent.
Deaths from malaria were soaring, partly because poor countries’ health systems were dramatically underfunded, and partly because the malaria parasite had developed resistance to the usual medicines.
Yet the potential to control malaria was actually improving, thanks to several newly emerging technologies: long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent the mosquitos from biting, better diagnostics to identify infections, and a new generation of highly effective medicines.
TB was also running out of control, with a massive disease burden in both Asia and Africa.
As with malaria, the TB bacteria had developed resistance to the traditional therapeutic drugs.
A frightening new epidemic of multi-drug-resistant TB – or MDR-TB, which was much harder to treat than mainstream TB – had erupted.
There were also cases of extreme MDR-TB, soon called XDR-TB, which resisted even the back-up medicines.
Back in 2000, the rich countries were not taking adequate steps to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria.
Aid flows were tiny.
At the time, I had recently been appointed by the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) to help bring finance ministers and health ministers together to see what could be done, both immediately and in the longer term.
Our advisory group, known as the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, recommended that rich countries scale up their health-care aid to poor countries, including efforts to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria. This aid would save lives, improve well-being, and help strengthen economic development.
Former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, the remarkable director-general of the WHO at the time, strongly supported this recommendation.
At the international AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, in July 2000, I described why a new global fund was needed to fight AIDS.
In early 2001, former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan launched a powerful and persuasive appeal to establish the Global Fund.
Leaders around the world responded to Annan’s call; within months, the Global Fund was born.
I remember those days vividly. In international public-health circles, there was great excitement.
Yet there was also frustration and bewilderment, as vocal opponents of foreign aid began to oppose the increased funding for disease control.
Several economists with little knowledge of public health became outspoken opponents.
They argued on the basis of free-market ideology rather than evidence, claiming that foreign aid always fails.
Fortunately, world leaders listened to public-health specialists and not to the aid skeptics.
US President George W. Bush’s administration provided strong and important support for the Global Fund – and also created new US programs to fight AIDS and malaria.
By the second half of the 2000’s, programs to fight the three main killer communicable diseases were scaling up around the world.
Over the objection of the aid skeptics, the Global Fund provided financial support for massive free distribution of bed nets, diagnostics, and medicines to address malaria.
Lo and behold, for the first time in a generation, deaths from malaria in Africa began to fall (steeply in some places).
Hundreds of thousands of lives, mainly African children, were now being saved every year.
Children were spared not only death but also debilitating infections, enabling them to attend school and lead more productive lives in the future.
The same thing happened with HIV/AIDS and TB.
Back in 2000, before the Global Fund was established, infected people in developing countries died of AIDS without any chance to receive life-saving antiretroviral medicines.
By 2010, more than six million people in developing countries were receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Similarly, testing and treatment for TB rose sharply, including a strong increase in several heavily affected Asian countries.
The aid skeptics were proved wrong.
Aid for health has worked.
The world has benefited enormously from the triumph of generosity, professionalism, common decency, and good sense.
Yet the battle to mobilize adequate financing remains.
The same skeptics repeat their tired opposition without reference to a decade of evidence.
It is shocking how their free-market fundamentalism (or simply ideological opposition to aid of any kind) can blind them to life-and-death needs and the efficacy of practical approaches that are well known to health professionals.
(They are also blind to professional methods in other areas, such as food production.)
The Global Fund is urgently appealing for a minimum of $5 billion per year for the next three years – a tiny sum relative to the world economy (and equal to roughly $5 per person in the high-income countries). It could wisely use twice that amount.
It seems likely that the US Government will agree to contribute one-third of the $5 billion if the rest of the world delivers the remainder.
The United Kingdom recently made a strong pledge, and the world now awaits the announcements of Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan, and other long-standing and new donor countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
Millions of people around the world will live, or die, depending on what these governments decide in December.
May they, and we, choose life.

America’s Labor Market by the Numbers
NEWPORT BEACH – Politicians and economists now join investors in a ritual that typically takes place on the first Friday of each month and has important consequences for global markets: anticipating, internalizing, and reacting to the monthly employment report released by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
Over the last few years, the report has evolved in a significant way – not only providing an assessment of the economy’s past and current state, but, increasingly, containing insights into its future as well.
Think of the BLS’s employment report as a comprehensive monthly check-up for the American labor market.
Among its many interesting statistics, it tells you how many jobs are created and where; how earnings and hours worked are evolving; and the number, age, and education of those seeking employment.
Despite the data’s richness, only two indicators consistently attract widespread attention: net monthly job creation (which amounted to 169,000 in August) and the unemployment rate (7.3% in August, the lowest since December 2008).
Together they point to a gradual and steady improvement in overall labor-market conditions.
This is certainly good news.
It is not long ago that job creation was negative and the unemployment rate stood at 10%.
The problem is that the headline numbers shed only partial light on what may lie ahead.
The figure for monthly job creation, for example, is distorted by the growing importance of part-time employment, and it fails to convey the reality of stagnant earnings.
Meanwhile, the headline unemployment rate does not reflect the growing number of Americans who have left the work force – a phenomenon vividly reflected by the decline in the labor participation rate to just 63.2%, a 35-year low.
To get a real sense of the labor market’s health, we need to look elsewhere in the BLS’s report.
What these other numbers have to tell us – about both the present and the future – is far from reassuring.
Consider the statistics on the duration of unemployment.
After all, the longer one is unemployed, the harder it is to find a full-time job at a decent wage.
In August, the BLS classified 4.3 million Americans as long-term unemployed, or 37.9% of the total unemployed – a worrisome figure, given that the global financial crisis was five years ago.
And, remember, this number excludes all the discouraged Americans who are no longer looking for a job.
In fact, the more comprehensive employment/population ratio stands at only 58.6%.
The teenage-unemployment rate is another under-appreciated indicator that is at an alarming level.
At 22.7%, too many American teenagers, lacking steady work experience early in their professional careers, risk going from unemployed to unemployable.
Then there are the indicators that link educational attainment and employment status.
Most notable here is the growing gap between those with a college degree (where the unemployment rate is only 3.5%) and those lacking a high school diploma (11.3%).
Rather than confirming the paradigm of gradual and steady improvement, these disaggregated numbers attest to a highly segmented, multi-speed labor market – one with features that could become more deeply embedded in the structure of the economy.
If current trends persist, the BLS’s report will continue to evolve from a snapshot of the past and present to a preview of the future.
Undoubtedly, the US labor market’s uneven recovery has much to do with the structural and policy gaps exposed by the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed.
The economy is still struggling to provide a sufficient number of jobs for those who were previously employed in leverage-driven activities that are no longer sustainable (let alone desirable).
Moreover, US schools, particularly at the primary and secondary levels, continue to slip down the global scale, constraining Americans’ ability to benefit from globalization.
Meanwhile, existing and newly created jobs provide less of an earnings upside.
And political polarization narrows the scope for effective tactical and structural policy responses.
This combination of factors is particularly burdensome for the most vulnerable segments of the US population – particularly those with limited educational attainment, first-time labor-market entrants, and those who have been out of work for an extended period.
So while net job creation will continue and the unemployment rate will maintain its downward trajectory – both highly welcome – the labor market’s evolution risks fueling rather than countering already-significant income and wealth inequalities, as well as poverty.
Overburdened social support mechanisms would thus come under even greater pressure.
And all of this would amplify rather than attenuate political polarization, placing other urgent policy priorities at even greater risk.
If this interpretation is correct, the heightened attention given to the monthly BLS headline indicators needs to be accompanied by a broader analysis and a different mindset.
After all, the report is much more than a scorecard on America’s performance in confronting a persistent economic, political, and social challenge; it is also an urgent call for a more focused corrective effort involving both government and business.
A better mix of fiscal and monetary policies and sustained measures to enhance productivity and competitiveness remain necessary conditions for addressing America’s labor-market challenges.
But they are not sufficient.
Both the public and private sectors – individually and through scalable and durable partnerships – need to think much more seriously about labor retraining and retooling programs, enhanced labor mobility, vocational training, and internships.
President Barack Obama’s appointment of a “jobs czar” would also help to enhance the credibility, accountability, and coordination required to overcome today’s significant and rising employment challenges.
Yes, the headline numbers will continue to signal overall improvement in the labor market.
The urgent task now is to ensure that lasting progress is not undermined by the worrisome compositional trends that the BLS’s report highlights month after month.

Apple Versus the G-Men
VIRGINIA BEACH – Apple’s refusal to unlock the iPhone linked to the extremist attack in San Bernardino, California, in December has triggered a public battle with the US Justice Department and the FBI – a dispute with far-reaching implications for data privacy worldwide.
But the case is not as straightforward as it seems.
Speaking as someone with a long presence in the US intelligence community, I believe that the FBI has already gained access to Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone.
It is an older Apple model using technology that, in other contexts, has already been compromised.
Here’s another strange thing about the FBI’s demand of Apple: Why would the United States government stoop to a public debate on this issue?
The FBI is the country’s most powerful law-enforcement organization, and Apple will ultimately be forced to comply with its request.
(Full disclosure: I own Apple stock.)
The FBI has already said that this is not about just one phone.
But few understand that this is not a simple matter of opposing interests: public safety versus an individual’s right to privacy.
For a better understanding of the FBI’s demand, we need to look at Apple’s latest line of phones, which differ from Farook’s in a fundamental respect: They contain a new chip that was designed using a technique developed by the US National Security Agency and then shared with the Israelis.
That technology is now finding its way into Apple products via the company’s Israeli chip-design division.
Each of the new chips has a unique signature used for encryption, which is coupled with its user’s fingerprint.
Without that signature, it is impossible to decrypt an Apple phone without physical access to the internals of its chip – which is itself impenetrable.
That encryption also applies to any information sent by the phone to a paired service, like Apple’s Messages system.
In the past, immediate access to telephony devices has been irrelevant to the FBI, because the authorities had unfettered access to communications as they traveled to and from a phone.
But, with its new security improvements, Apple is now closing that door.
The company is not simply denying new access; it will soon take away existing access.
This bothers the FBI, because its job is to collect evidence.
Interestingly, the NSA has taken a different stance.
Backdoors have been acknowledged as dangerous by NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers, who says that “encryption is foundational to the future.” When access to private communications is possible, anyone can use it for any purpose.
This complicates the FBI’s argument about public safety.
For example, do we really want a terrorist group to be capable of accessing a president’s or prime minister’s private information?
If a phone has a backdoor, it can be opened by anyone with enough motivation – criminals, extremists, and governments alike.
The Chinese authorities, for example, would be delighted if Apple complied with the FBI’s request.
They have been asking Apple for a backdoor for years.
Apple’s current stand could cause it to suffer in the massive Chinese market – or profit immensely if it complies.
The FBI’s request signals a new attempt at control.
This is an organization that usually delivers its requests under seal, meaning they remain secret.
In this case, the FBI took the unusual step of making its demand public, so as to push the issue into the press by hitting the hot button of “terrorism.” The FBI’s intent, it seems, is to prompt lawmakers to respond to public outrage.
Most legal arguments against “unlocking” this particular phone cite the constitutionally protected right to free speech.
But a better parallel is the right to gun ownership in the US and the constitutional provisions that support it.
In the past, technology in the US was primarily developed in a military context and justified in the service of war, but also to maintain civil order.
At the end of the eighteenth century, the apotheosis of that technology was the firearm.
No other technology was as apt, so the US Constitution specified that it would not be used to curtail speech (First Amendment) or be denied to the citizenry (Second Amendment), and that government holders of firearms could not be placed in citizens’ homes (Third Amendment).
The Ninth and Tenth Amendments proscribe the use of firearms to compromise other implicit rights as they may become apparent.
Today’s most powerful technologies relate to information concerning our thoughts, associations, and bodies.
If the framers of the US Constitution were alive today and as well educated as they were then, the Bill of Rights would likely be focused on balancing access to information to ensure that the government remains within bounds.
With this public request from the FBI, the balance between people and policing is being called into question.
As the debate unfolds, we need to consider whether it makes sense, legally or as a matter of policy, for everyone – law enforcement, hackers, and terrorists – to be able to possess or access information.
The Apple case will affect the balance of informational power, and the scales currently are weighted against the citizen.
Resolving the case requires a more considered response from US politicians than hysterical tweeting.
In view of the modern power of information, they must think carefully about the legal ramifications of the FBI’s demand.

Friedman Completed Keynes
The most famous and influential American economist of the past century died in November.
Milton Friedman was not the most famous and influential economist in the world -- that honor belongs to John Maynard Keynes. But Milton Friedman ran a close second.
From one perspective, Milton Friedman was the star pupil of, successor to, and completer of Keynes’s work.
Keynes, in his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money , set out the framework that nearly all macroeconomists use today. That framework is based on spending and demand, the determinants of the components of spending, the liquidity-preference theory of short-run interest rates, and the requirement that government make strategic but powerful interventions in the economy to keep it on an even keel and avoid extremes of depression and manic excess.
As Friedman said, “We are all Keynesians now.”
But Keynes’s theory was incomplete: his was a theory of employment, interest, and money. It was not a theory of prices.
To Keynes’s framework, Friedman added a theory of prices and inflation, based on the idea of the natural rate of unemployment and the limits of government policy in stabilizing the economy around its long-run growth trend – limits beyond which intervention would trigger uncontrollable and destructive inflation.
Moreover, Friedman corrected Keynes’s framework in one very important respect.
The experience of the Great Depression led Keynes and his more orthodox successors to greatly underestimate the role and influence of monetary policy.
Friedman, in a 30-year campaign starting with his and Anna J. Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United States , restored the balance.
As Friedman also said, “and none of us are Keynesian.”
From another perspective, Friedman was the arch-opponent and enemy of Keynes and his successors.
Friedman and Keynes both agreed that successful macroeconomic management was necessary - that the private economy on its own might well be subject to unbearable instability ­and that strategic, powerful, but limited economic intervention by the government was necessary to maintain stability.
But, while for Keynes, the key was to keep the sum of government spending and private investment stable, for Friedman the key was to keep the money supply -- the amount of purchasing power in readily spendable form in the hands of businesses and households-- stable.
A relatively minor, technical difference in means, you might say.
A difference of opinion that rested on different judgments about how the world works, which could (and ultimately was) resolved by empirical research, you might say.
And you would be half right. For this difference in means, tactics, and empirical judgments rested on top of deep gulf in Keynes’s and Friedman’s moral philosophy.
Keynes saw himself as the enemy of laissez-faire and an advocate of public management.
Clever government officials of goodwill, he thought, could design economic institutions that would be superior to the market -- or could at least tweak the market with taxes, subsidies, and regulations to produce superior outcomes.
It was simply not the case, Keynes argued, that the private incentives of those active in the marketplace were aligned with the public good.
Technocracy was Keynes’s faith: skilled experts designing and fine-tuning institutions out of the goodness of their hearts to make possible general prosperity -- as Keynes, indeed, did at Bretton Woods where the World Bank and IMF were created.
Friedman disagreed vociferously.
In his view, it usually was the case that private market interests were aligned with the public good: episodes of important and significant market failure were the exception, rather than the rule, and laissez-faire was a good first approximation.
Moreover, Friedman believed that even when private interests were not aligned with public interests, that government could not be relied on to fix the problem.
Governments were inept. The kinds of people who staffed governments were the kinds of people who liked ordering others around.
At the same time, Friedman believed that even when the market equilibrium was not the utilitarian social-welfare optimum, and even when government could be used to improve matters from a utilitarian point of view, there was still an additional value in letting human freedom have the widest berth possible.
There was, Friedman believed, something intrinsically bad about government commanding and ordering people about -- even if the government did know what it was doing.
I do not know whether Keynes or Friedman was more right in their deep orientation. But I do think that the tension between their two views has been a very valuable driving force for human progress over the past hundred years.

The G-20’s Helpful Silence on Capital Controls
NEW YORK – When French President Nicolas Sarkozy took the reins as host of this year’s G-20 summit, to be held in Cannes on November 3-4, he called on the International Monetary Fund to develop an enforceable “code of conduct” for the use of capital controls (or capital-account regulations, as we prefer to call them) in the world economy.
The IMF followed through by publishing a preliminary set of guidelines this past April.
Regulation of cross-border capital flows has been strangely absent from the G-20’s agenda, which is aimed at strengthening financial regulation.
But they are a central element in the financial volatility that incited calls for stronger regulation in the first place.
The IMF has shown that those countries that deployed capital-account regulations were among the least hard-hit during the worst of the global financial crisis.
Since 2009, it has accepted and even recommended that such regulations are useful to manage the massive inflows of “hot money” into emerging markets.
That said, while the IMF’s proposed code is a step in the right direction, it is misguided.
So, the G-20’s endorsement of the Fund’s guidelines would not be wise for a world economy trying to recover from one financial crisis while preventing the next one.
With low interest rates and a slow recovery in the developed countries, accompanied by high interest rates and rapid growth in emerging markets, the world’s investors flocked from the former to the latter – Brazil, Chile, South Korea, Taiwan, and others.
Then, in recent months, they flocked out of those emerging countries, showing once again how volatile and dangerous such flows are.
Indeed, as the IMF has pointed out in its World Economic Outlook, these flows threaten to inflate asset bubbles, make it harder for countries to pursue an independent monetary policy, and trigger currency appreciation and associated losses in export competitiveness.
Brazil’s currency, for instance, appreciated more than 40% from 2009 until August 2011, before weakening in recent months.
Some countries responded by doing nothing, but many, including industrialized countries like Japan and Switzerland, intervened heavily in currency markets.
Some resorted to capital-account regulations on inflows, such as taxes on the foreign purchases of bonds, equities, and derivatives, reserve requirements on short-term inflows, and so forth.
Brazil’s finance minister referred to these numerous actions as the “currency wars.”
This is where Sarkozy came in, using his platform as G-20 host to try to forge a set of enforceable guidelines to govern capital-flow management.
The IMF’s proposed guidelines recommend that countries deploy capital-account regulations only as a last resort – that is, after such measures as building up reserves, letting currencies appreciate, and cutting budget deficits.
In response to these suggestions, an independent Task Force, made up of former government officials and academics, was established to examine the use of capital-account regulations and come up with an alternative set of guidelines for the use of such regulations in developing countries.
Among other findings and recommendations, our task force pointed out that in the cases where the IMF found capital-account regulations to be effective, such measures were part of a broader macroeconomic toolkit, and were deployed early on, alongside other measures, not as a “last resort.”
Unless countries have signed trade and investment treaties that restrict the use of such regulations (and many have), the IMF’s Articles of Agreement give them full policy scope to manage capital flows as they see fit.
Consigning such measures to “last resort” status would reduce the available options precisely when countries need as many tools as possible to prevent and mitigate crises.
Rather than embracing a globally enforceable code of conduct that could paradoxically lead to a compulsory opening of capital accounts across the globe, the IMF, the G-20, the Financial Stability Board, and other bodies should try to reduce the stigma attached to capital-account regulations and protect countries’ ability to deploy them.
Indeed, the IMF could help countries to prevent evasion of the regulations, and, together with the G-20 and the FSB, should lead a global dialogue about the extent to which countries should coordinate such regulations.
Countries’ interests are considerably aligned in favor of such coordination.
Industrialized economies are seeking to recover from the crisis, and want credit and capital to stay home to boost growth, while developing countries have little interest in gaining short-term capital inflows.
This could form the basis for industrialized countries to adjust their tax codes and deploy other types of regulation to keep capital at home, while emerging markets implement measures aimed at changing the composition and reducing the level of potentially destabilizing inflows.

The DNA of German Foreign Policy
BERLIN – The harsh reality of the past year has created unprecedented challenges for Germany and its foreign policy.
The crisis in Ukraine spiraled out of control, with Russia's annexation of Crimea, followed by military escalation in the eastern Donbas region, calling into question the post-1945 European order.
And, though the measures agreed in Minsk earlier this month offer an opportunity to enter into a political process, other crises – for example, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the advance of ISIS – have presented new, urgent challenges.
Whether Germany should assume greater responsibility for seeking to resolve such issues is a hotly debated question, both inside and outside the country.
During a year-long “Review 2014," experts, officials, and the wider public discussed challenges, priorities, and instruments of German foreign policy, and tried to define Germany's role in the world.
At the end of the day, outcomes are always concrete.
In some areas, we have been successful over the last year; in others, we can and want to do better.
Germany is widely appreciated for its commitment to promoting peaceful conflict resolution, the rule of law, and a sustainable economic model.
Yet it is abundantly clear from the Review that our partners expect a more active – and even more robust – German foreign policy in the future.
Expectations are high – perhaps too high at times.
So it is up to Germany's people to answer the difficult questions: Where do our interests lie?
How far do our responsibilities extend?
What, in short, is the “DNA" of German foreign policy?
The basic tenets of Germany's foreign policy – close partnership with France within a united Europe and a strong transatlantic alliance in terms of both security and economic cooperation – have withstood the test of time, and will remain a cornerstone of our approach.
But now we must address three key challenges: crisis management, the changing global order, and our position within Europe.
For starters, we must face the fact that globalization has made crises the rule, not the exception.
Though globalization and digitization are driving rapid economic growth, they are also putting pressure on governments worldwide to meet citizens' rising expectations – even as they constrain in unprecedented ways governments' ability to act.
In our globalized world, many people feel a growing desire for the clear answers and timeless validity offered by straightforward and clear-cut identities.
When these identities take the form of nationalism or rigidly defined religious or ethnic categories, the consequence, all too often, is brutal and unrestrained violence, whether through terrorism or civil war.
In confronting crises, German foreign policy must strengthen its focus on reconciliation, mediation, and prevention – or risk being left with no other option but damage control.
Germany is willing to do more in this area internationally.
We want to act sooner, more decisively, and in a more substantial manner – not just when crises become acute, but also by focusing on conflict prevention and post-conflict management.
This requires that we hone our tools and develop new ones, ranging from early-warning mechanisms to enhanced means of international cooperation.
We will review how we can help the United Nations more significantly in safeguarding and building peace.
We must address, with restraint and prudence – rather than with a reflexive “nein" – the difficult question of whether military means are necessary to safeguard political solutions.
We do not know when and where the next crisis will erupt, but we do know that it will – and that we must be better prepared when it does.
But foreign policy must not focus exclusively on crises. It must also prepare for future scenarios.
And, because Germany is connected to the rest of the world like few other countries, a commitment to a just, peaceful, and resilient international order is a fundamental interest of our foreign policy.
That means adjusting to the long-term changes in the existing order's parameters – changes that have been wrought, above all, by China's rapid rise.
As the tectonic plates of world politics shift, Germany must be more precise in defining its own contributions to maintaining existing structures of international order and establishing new ones.
We must think more deeply about ways to safeguard valuable public goods: the seas, space, and the Internet.
As a result, we must strike the right balance between reinforcing indispensable structures and organizations like the UN and developing new norms and institutional means of minimizing long-term risks.
The key challenge is to develop a proactive foreign policy that invests in order, international institutions, and the intelligent strengthening of international law.
Then there is Europe, which remains the foundation of Germany's foreign policy.
But here, too, new challenges require new answers. Above all, we must prevent a strategic dilemma in which Germany felt forced to decide between its competitiveness in a globalized world and European integration.
Europe should benefit from Germany's strength, just as we benefit from Europe's.
As Europe's largest economy, we must invest in integration.
That is the source of our strength.
At the same time, we must withstand the temptations that come with Germany's current stature.
In very different ways, the US, Russia, and China are offering Germany a privileged relationship.
But, though we want to maintain and strengthen bilateral ties with important partner countries, when it comes to shaping global development, Germany is capable of acting effectively only within a solid European framework.
We have no reason to shrink from these challenges.
Even under the pressures of a globalized world, democratic systems that champion the rule of law are more resilient than the illiberal regimes that many – including some in Europe – are praising nowadays.
But this does not mean that we can defuse any crisis by means of preventive action or clever intervention.
Now more than ever, understanding the limits of one's capabilities is an essential part of a viable foreign policy.
This does not mean embracing moral relativism.
Our foreign policy must retain its hopefulness and ability to act responsibly.
Yet holding firm to our moral precepts must go hand in hand with a realistic assessment of constraints.
Germany's global inter-connectedness, which has long been vital for our prosperity and security, does not allow us to pretend that we are either an island or a world historical force.
Within any effective peace strategy for the twenty-first century, foreign policy must simultaneously focus on crisis prevention and diplomacy, and bolster efforts that support transformation.
For Germany, all of these objectives must be pursued within the framework of a strong and integrated European Union in which we assume our leadership responsibilities for global peace and prosperity.
Germany has much to offer to the world, and we will do so with self-confidence and humility.

Infrastructure’s Class of Its Own
BEIJING – After several months of disappointing economic indicators, China’s State Council has unveiled a “mini-stimulus” package, focused on social-housing construction and railway expansion.
The decision came a month after Premier Li Keqiang’s declaration that China had set its annual growth target at “around 7.5%” – the same as last year’s goal.
The implication is clear: While consumption-driven growth remains a long-term goal for China, infrastructure will continue – at least in the short term – to serve as a key driver of China’s economy.
Of course, China is not the only economy that depends on infrastructure investment to buttress economic growth.
The World Bank estimates that infrastructure investments accounted for nearly half of the acceleration in Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic growth in 2001-2005.
According to the Bank, a 10% increase in infrastructure investment is associated with GDP growth of 1%.
Such investment also creates jobs, both in the short term, by creating demand for materials and labor, and in the long term, for related services.
For example, every $100 million invested in rural road maintenance translates into an estimated 25,000-50,000 job opportunities.
But these benefits are diluted in China, owing to its excessive reliance on public funding.
Indeed, in recent years, less than 0.03% of Chinese infrastructure investment – which amounted to roughly 9% of GDP – was derived from private capital.
This problem is not limited to China; of the 7.2% of GDP that Asian countries spend, on average, on infrastructure development, only about 0.2% is privately funded.
By contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, private capital finances, respectively, 1.9% and 1.6% of infrastructure investment.
Discussions within the G-20 have produced two possible explanations for Asian countries’ inability to attract more private capital to infrastructure projects.
Most developing countries argue that the problem is rooted in the provision of capital, with investors preferring to fill their infrastructure portfolios with low-risk projects, and insurance companies and banks facing overly restrictive regulations.
OECD countries like Germany counter that the problem is the lack of investment-worthy assets; there are simply not enough bankable projects available.
In fact, both explanations are correct – but neither is complete.
It is time for Asia’s leaders to recognize that the lack of private funding for infrastructure projects cannot be reduced to one or even two problems, and to develop comprehensive solutions that account for the full scope of the challenge.
This requires, first and foremost, abandoning the view that infrastructure assets fit into the paradigm of traditional asset classes like equity, debt, or real estate.
Infrastructure must be redefined as a new asset class, based on several considerations.
For starters, there is the public-good element of many infrastructure projects, which demands contingent government obligations like universal coverage levels for basic services.
In order to make such projects more appealing to private investors, economic externalities should be internalized, and a link should be established between the internal rate of return, which matters to a commercial investor, and the economic rate of return, which matters to society.
Moreover, innovative mechanisms to supply new assets to investors would be needed – and that requires the creativity found and priced by markets.
To this end, private-sector sponsors must be given space to initiate valuable projects.
The new asset class would need its own standardized risk/return profile, accounting, for example, for the political risks that public-sector involvement may imply and for the lower returns from infrastructure relative to traditional private equity.
Moreover, the risks associated with the new asset class would change as projects progress from feasibility study to construction to operation, implying that each phase would attract different sources of funding.
A clear understanding of this process would enable potential investors to assess projects more effectively, which is critical to encouraging them to put up financing.
Another important consideration is the considerable technical expertise that infrastructure investments demand, which makes them more complex than most assets.
Similarly, a specialized network of actors would be needed to ensure that intermediation of infrastructure transactions is efficient and cost-effective, instead of fragmented and slow, as it is now.
For countries that lack China’s strong fiscal position, the need to attract private capital to infrastructure investment is obvious.
With nearly 70% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lacking access to electricity and 65% of South Asians lacking access to basic sanitation, there is no greater imperative than to plan, fund, build, and maintain infrastructure assets.
But private investment in infrastructure remains vital even in countries like China, because it brings the power and dynamism of the market, which improves the allocation of capital and promotes transparency.
Indeed, more private-sector involvement would make the kind of scandals that have occurred in China’s railway sector far less likely.
In short, redefining infrastructure as a new asset class is the only credible way to attract funding for infrastructure construction, and thus to boost long-term economic growth and the employment rate.
It is time for Asia’s leaders to step up.

Two Dollar Fallacies
CAMBRIDGE – The United States’ current fiscal and monetary policies are unsustainable.
The US government’s net debt as a share of GDP has doubled in the past five years, and the ratio is projected to be higher a decade from now, even if the economy has fully recovered and interest rates are in a normal range.
An aging US population will cause social benefits to rise rapidly, pushing the debt to more than 100% of GDP and accelerating its rate of increase.
Although the Federal Reserve and foreign creditors like China are now financing the increase, their willingness to do so is not unlimited.
Likewise, the Fed’s policy of large-scale asset purchases has increased commercial banks’ excess reserves to unprecedented levels (approaching $2 trillion), and has driven the real interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds to an unprecedented negative level.
As the Fed acknowledges, this will have to stop and be reversed.
While the future evolution of these imbalances remains unclear, the result could eventually be a sharp rise in long-term interest rates and a substantial fall in the dollar’s value, driven mainly by foreign investors’ reluctance to continue expanding their holdings of US debt.
American investors, fearing an unwinding of the fiscal and monetary positions, might contribute to these changes by seeking to shift their portfolios to assets of other countries.
While I share these concerns, others frequently rely on two key arguments to dismiss the fear of a run on the dollar: the dollar is a reserve currency, and it carries fewer risks than other currencies.
Neither argument is persuasive.
Consider first the claim that the dollar’s status as a reserve currency protects it, because governments around the world need to hold dollars as foreign exchange reserves. The problem is that foreign holdings of dollar securities are no longer primarily “foreign exchange reserves” in the traditional sense.
In earlier decades, countries held dollars because they needed to have a highly liquid and widely accepted currency to bridge the financing gap if their imports exceeded their exports.
The obvious candidate for this reserve fund was US Treasury bills.
But, since the late 1990’s, countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have accumulated very large volumes of foreign reserves, reflecting both export-driven growth strategies and a desire to avoid a repeat of the speculative currency attacks that triggered the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis.
With each of these countries holding more than $200 billion in foreign-exchange holdings – and China holding more than $3 trillion – these are no longer funds intended to bridge trade-balance shortfalls.
They are major national assets that must be invested with attention to yield and risk.
So, although dollar bonds and, increasingly, dollar equities are a large part of these countries’ sovereign wealth accounts, most of the dollar securities that they hold are not needed to finance trade imbalances.
Even if these countries want to continue to hold a minimum core of their portfolios in a form that can be used in the traditional foreign-exchange role, most of their portfolios will respond to their perception of different currencies’ risks.
In short, the US no longer has what Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, as France’s finance minister in the 1960’s, accurately called the “exorbitant privilege” that stemmed from having a reserve currency as its legal tender.
But some argue that, even if the dollar is not protected by being a reserve currency, it is still safer than other currencies.
If investors don’t want to hold euros, pounds, or yen, where else can they go?
That argument is also false.
Large portfolio investors don’t put all of their funds in a single currency.
They diversify their funds among different currencies and different types of financial assets.
If they perceive that the dollar and dollar bonds have become riskier, they will want to change the distribution of assets in their portfolios.
So, even if the dollar is still regarded as the safest of assets, the demand for dollars will decline if its relative safety is seen to have declined.
When that happens, exchange rates and interest rates can change without assets being sold and new assets bought.
If foreign holders of dollar bonds become concerned that the unsustainability of America’s situation will lead to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar, they will want to sell dollar bonds.
If that feeling is widespread, the value of the dollar and the price of dollar bonds can both decline without any net change in the holding of these assets.
The dollar’s real trade-weighted value already is more than 25% lower than it was a decade ago, notwithstanding the problems in Europe and in other countries.
And, despite a more competitive exchange rate, the US continues to run a large current-account deficit.
If progress is not made in reducing the projected fiscal imbalances and limiting the growth of bank reserves, reduced demand for dollar assets could cause the dollar to fall more rapidly and the interest rate on dollar securities to rise.

American Soft Power in the Age of Trump
CAMBRIDGE – US President Donald Trump’s administration has shown little interest in public diplomacy.
And yet public diplomacy – a government’s efforts to communicate directly with other countries’ publics – is one of the key instruments policymakers use to generate soft power, and the current information revolution makes such instruments more important than ever.
Opinion polls and the Portland Soft Power 30 index show that American soft power has declined since the beginning of Trump’s term.
Tweets can help to set the global agenda, but they do not produce soft power if they are not attractive to others.
Trump’s defenders reply that soft power – what happens in the minds of others – is irrelevant; only hard power, with its military and economic instruments, matters.
In March 2017, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, proclaimed a “hard power budget” that would have slashed funding for the State Department and the US Agency for International Development by nearly 30%.
Fortunately, military leaders know better.
In 2013, General James Mattis (later Trump’s first Secretary of Defense) warned Congress, “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.”
As Henry Kissinger once pointed out, international order depends not only on the balance of hard power, but also on perceptions of legitimacy, which depends crucially on soft power.
Information revolutions always have profound socioeconomic and political consequences – witness the dramatic effects of Gutenberg’s printing press on Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
One can date the current information revolution from the 1960s and the advent of “Moore’s Law”: the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles roughly every two years.
As a result, computing power increased dramatically, and by the beginning of this century cost 0.1% of what it did in the early 1970s.
In 1993, there were about 50 websites in the world; by 2000, that number surpassed five million.
Today, more than four billion people are online; that number is projected to grow to 5-6 billion people by 2020, and the “Internet of Things” will connect tens of billions of devices.
Facebook has more users than the populations of China and the US combined.
In such a world, the power to attract and persuade becomes increasingly important.
But long gone are the days when public diplomacy was mainly conducted through radio and television broadcasting.
Technological advances have led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of processing and transmitting information.
The result is an explosion of information, which has produced a “paradox of plenty”: an abundance of information leads to scarcity of attention.
When the volume of information confronting people becomes overwhelming, it is hard to know what to focus on.
Social media algorithms are designed to compete for attention.
Reputation becomes even more important than in the past, and political struggles, informed by social and ideological affinities, often center on the creation and destruction of credibility.
Social media can make false information look more credible if it comes from “friends.”
As US Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election showed, this enabled Russia to weaponize American social media.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become an even more important power resource.
Information that appears to be propaganda may not only be scorned, but may also turn out to be counterproductive if it undermines a country’s reputation for credibility – and thus reduces its soft power.
The most effective propaganda is not propaganda. It is a two-way dialogue among people.
Russia and China do not seem to comprehend this, and sometimes the United States fails to pass the test as well.
During the Iraq War, for example, the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in a manner inconsistent with American values led to perceptions of hypocrisy that could not be reversed by broadcasting pictures of Muslims living well in America.
Today, presidential “tweets” that prove to be demonstrably false undercut America’s credibility and reduce its soft power.
The effectiveness of public diplomacy is measured by minds changed (as reflected in interviews or polls), not dollars spent or number of messages sent.
Domestic or foreign policies that appear hypocritical, arrogant, indifferent to others’ views, or based on a narrow conception of national interest can undermine soft power.
For example, there was a steep decline in the attractiveness of the US in opinion polls conducted after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
In the 1970s, many people around the world objected to the US war in Vietnam, and America’s global standing reflected the unpopularity of that policy.
Skeptics argue that such cycles show that soft power does not matter much; countries cooperate out of self-interest.
But this argument misses a crucial point: cooperation is a matter of degree, and the degree is affected by attraction or repulsion.
Fortunately, a country’s soft power depends not only on its official policies, but also on the attractiveness of its civil society.
When protesters overseas were marching against the Vietnam War, they often sang “We Shall Overcome,” an anthem of the US civil rights movement.
Given past experience, there is every reason to hope that the US will recover its soft power after Trump, though a greater investment in public diplomacy would certainly help.

Free Speech under Siege
LONDON – Recently, at a literary festival in Britain, I found myself on a panel discussing free speech.
For liberals, free speech is a key index of freedom.
Democracies stand for free speech; dictatorships suppress it.
When we in the West look outward, this remains our view.
We condemn governments that silence, imprison, and even kill writers and journalists.
ReportersSans Frontières keeps a list: 24 journalists have been killed, and 148 imprisoned, just this year.
Part of the promise we see in the “Arab Spring” is the liberation of the media from the dictator’s grasp.
Yet freedom of speech in the West is under strain.
Traditionally, British law imposed two main limitations on the “right to free speech.”
The first prohibited the use of words or expressions likely to disrupt public order; the second was the law against libel.
There are good grounds for both – to preserve the peace, and to protect individuals’ reputations from lies.
Most free societies accept such limits as reasonable.
But the law has recently become more restrictive. “Incitement to religious and racial hatred” and “incitement to hatred on the basis of sexual orientation” are now illegal in most European countries, independent of any threat to public order.
The law has shifted from proscribing language likely to cause violence to prohibiting language intended to give offense.
A blatant example of this is the law against Holocaust denial.
To deny or minimize the Holocaust is a crime in 15 European countries and Israel.
It may be argued that the Holocaust was a crime so uniquely abhorrent as to qualify as a special case.
But special cases have a habit of multiplying.
France has made it illegal to deny any “internationally recognized crimes against humanity.”
Whereas in Muslim countries it is illegal to call the Armenian massacres of 1915-1917 “genocide,” in some Western countries it is illegal to say that they were not.
Some East European countries specifically prohibit the denial of communist “genocides.”
The censorship of memory, which we once fondly imagined to be the mark of dictatorship, is now a major growth industry in the “free” West.
Indeed, official censorship is only the tip of an iceberg of cultural censorship.
A public person must be on constant guard against causing offense, whether intentionally or not.
Breaking the cultural code damages a person’s reputation, and perhaps one’s career.
Britain’s Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke recently had to apologize for saying that some rapes were less serious than others, implying the need for legal discrimination.
The parade of gaffes and subsequent groveling apologies has become a regular feature of public life.
In his classic essay On Liberty, John Stuart Mill defended free speech on the ground that free inquiry was necessary to advance knowledge.
Restrictions on certain areas of historical inquiry are based on the opposite premise: the truth is known, and it is impious to question it.
This is absurd; every historian knows that there is no such thing as final historical truth.
It is not the task of history to defend public order or morals, but to establish what happened. Legally protected history ensures that historians will play safe.
To be sure, living by Mill’s principle often requires protecting the rights of unsavory characters.
David Irving writes mendacious history, but his prosecution and imprisonment in Austria for “Holocaust denial” would have horrified Mill.
By contrast, the pressure for “political correctness” rests on the argument that the truth is unknowable.
Statements about the human condition are essentially matters of opinion. Because a statement of opinion by some individuals is almost certain to offend others, and since such statements make no contribution to the discovery of truth, their degree of offensiveness becomes the sole criterion for judging their admissibility.
Hence the taboo on certain words, phrases, and arguments that imply that certain individuals, groups, or practices are superior or inferior, normal or abnormal; hence the search for ever more neutral ways to label social phenomena, thereby draining language of its vigor and interest.
A classic example is the way that “family” has replaced “marriage” in public discourse, with the implication that all “lifestyles” are equally valuable, despite the fact that most people persist in wanting to get married.
It has become taboo to describe homosexuality as a “perversion,” though this was precisely the word used in the 1960’s by the radical philosopher Herbert Marcuse (who was praising homosexuality as an expression of dissent).
In today’s atmosphere of what Marcuse would call “repressive tolerance,” such language would be considered “stigmatizing.”
The sociological imperative behind the spread of “political correctness” is the fact that we no longer live in patriarchal, hierarchical, mono-cultural societies, which exhibit general, if unreflective, agreement on basic values.
The pathetic efforts to inculcate a common sense of “Britishness” or “Dutchness” in multi-cultural societies, however well-intentioned, attest to the breakdown of a common identity.
Public language has thus become the common currency of cultural exchange, and everyone is on notice to mind one’s manners. The result is a multiplication of weasel words that chill political and moral debate, and that create a widening gap between public language and what many ordinary people think.
The defense of free speech is made no easier by the abuses of the popular press.
We need free media to expose abuses of power.
But investigative journalism becomes discredited when it is suborned to “expose” the private lives of the famous when no issue of public interest is involved.
Entertaining gossip has mutated into an assault on privacy, with newspapers claiming that any attempt to keep them out of people’s bedrooms is an assault on free speech.
You know that a doctrine is in trouble when not even those claiming to defend it understand what it means.
By that standard, the classic doctrine of free speech is in crisis.
We had better sort it out quickly – legally, morally, and culturally – if we are to retain a proper sense of what it means to live in a free society.

In Defense of the 1.5°C Climate Change Threshold
MANILA – The Earth today is more than 1°C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and the terrible symptoms of its fever are already showing.
This year alone, back-to-back hurricanes have devastated Caribbean islands, monsoon flooding has displaced tens of millions in South Asia, and fires have raged on nearly every continent.
Pulling the planet back from the brink could not be more urgent.
Those of us who live on the front lines of climate change – on archipelagos, small islands, coastal lowlands, and rapidly desertifying plains – can’t afford to wait and see what another degree of warming will bring.
Already, far too many lives and livelihoods are being lost.
People are being uprooted, and vital resources are becoming increasingly scarce, while those suffering the most severe consequences of climate change are also among those who have done the least to cause it.
That is why the Philippines used its chairmanship of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) – an alliance of the 48 countries that stand to bear the brunt of climate change – to fight to ensure that the 2015 Paris climate agreement aimed explicitly to cap global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
For us, 1.5°C isn’t merely a symbolic or “aspirational” number to be plugged into international agreements; it is an existential limit.
If global temperatures rise above that level, the places we call home – and many other homes on this planet – will become uninhabitable or even disappear completely.
When we first introduced the 1.5°C target back in 2009, we met substantial resistance.
Climate-change deniers – those who refuse to believe the science of human-induced global warming – continue to dismiss any such effort to stem the rise in the planet’s temperature as futile and unnecessary.
But even well-meaning climate advocates and policymakers often opposed the 1.5°C target, arguing that, according to the science, humans had already emitted enough greenhouse gases to make meeting that goal virtually impossible.
Yet, on this front, the science is not as clear-cut as it might have seemed.
According to a recent paper published in Nature, the world’s remaining “carbon budget” – the amount of carbon-dioxide equivalents we can emit before breaching the 1.5°C threshold – is somewhat larger than was previously thought.
This finding is no reason for complacency, as some commentators (not scientists) seem to think.
It does not mean that previous climate models were excessively alarmist, or that we can take a more relaxed approach to reining in global warming.
Instead, the paper should inspire – and, indeed, calls for – more immediate, deliberate, and aggressive action to ensure that greenhouse-gas emissions peak within a few years and net-zero emissions are achieved by mid-century.
What would such action look like?
Global emissions would need to be reduced by 4-6% every year, until they reached zero.
Meanwhile, forest and agricultural lands would have to be restored, so that they could capture and sequester greater amounts of carbon dioxide.
Fully decarbonizing our energy and transportation systems in four decades will require a herculean effort, but it is not impossible.
Beyond their environmental consequences, such efforts would generate major economic gains, boosting the middle class in developed countries and pulling hundreds of millions out of poverty in the developing world, including by fueling job creation.
The energy transition will lead to massive efficiency savings, while improving the resilience of infrastructure, supply chains, and urban services in developing countries, particularly those in vulnerable regions.
According to a report published last year by the United Nations Development Programme, maintaining the 1.5°C threshold and creating a low-carbon economy would add as much as $12 trillion to global GDP, compared to a scenario in which the world sticks to current policies and emissions-reduction pledges.
The paper asserting that the 1.5°C target is achievable was written by well-respected climate experts and published in a top-ranking journal after extensive peer review.
But it is just one paper; there is still a lot more to learn about our capacity to limit global warming.
That is why top scientists are already discussing and debating its findings; their responses will also be published in top journals.
That is how scientific research works, and it is why we can trust climate science – and its urgent warnings.
Next year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish its own meta-analysis of all of the science related to the 1.5°C target, in what promises to be the most comprehensive summary of such research.
But we cannot afford to wait for that analysis before taking action.
The members of the CVF have already committed to doing our part, pledging at last year’s UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech to complete the transition to 100% renewable energy as soon as possible.
Our emissions are already among the world’s smallest, but our climate targets are the world’s most ambitious.
But whether the world manages to curb climate change ultimately will depend on the willingness of the largest current and historical emitters of greenhouse gases to fulfill their moral and ethical responsibility to take strong action.
Keeping global temperatures below 1.5°C may not yet be a geophysical impossibility.
But, to meet the target, we must ensure that it is not treated as a political and economic impossibility, either.

The US Needs A Draft
BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA – The United States needs a new draft – but not the kind you think.
For 25 years, before retiring as the 31st Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, I proudly wore the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, the USMC’s insignia.
I faced all kinds of enemies on the battlefield, without fear or doubt, because I always believed wholeheartedly in America’s democracy and the Constitution that is its foundation.
We are losing that belief and our connection to it.
When I was a young Marine in Vietnam, during a time of deep internal division in America, about half the country’s people said they trusted their fellow Americans.
That was very discouraging.
Today, according to a recent Brookings Institution study, that number is less than one-third.
Americans’ civic discourse has all but disappeared, giving way to pessimistic apathy, blind partisanship, and un-American rage at our fellow citizens.
In our national history, when we have faced terrible times of economic hardship, civil discord, and political division, more often than not an external threat brought us back together.
Today, however, that threat is internal, and it is a lot harder to identify.
But the effects are clear – a fundamental weakening of the bonds that unite us as Americans.
I am not a Democrat or a Republican.
I am an American, and my life has been guided by a clear and simple oath: to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
We have the world’s greatest military, and while foreign threats are real, I know our service members can handle them.
It is the domestic threats that we must address.
It is time to institute a new draft to create a national force of young men and women to serve our country’s critical domestic needs, while instilling in them a greater appreciation of our democracy and how it functions.
Our government should establish a mandatory, two-year, paid national service program that would bring together Americans of different backgrounds and help break down geographic, racial, ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic barriers to a deeply felt and widely shared civic identity.
Unlike AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps, the two best-known existing federal US service programs, priorities should be defined at the state and local level, because they differ widely across the country.
The federal government should launch a block-grant program for each state to decide where an army of young men and women could best address its communities’ most urgent social needs.
Such needs might include assistance for the homeless and military veterans; mentoring students in poorly performing schools; regional crisis forces to improve responses to natural disasters; a program, modeled on the New Deal-era Works Progress Administration, to re-build local infrastructure like bridges and roads and clean up waterways and parks; and rural health initiatives to address critical nursing shortages, confront opioid addiction, and care for the elderly.
And, to broaden young Americans’ perspectives on issues facing communities beyond their own, half of each state’s draftees should carry out their service in another state.
All draftees should begin their service with a 12-week training period similar to what we do in the military, with a curriculum focused on teaching self-discipline, accountability, teamwork, and physical fitness.
We should create a program for retirees from service professions to become mentor-instructors to these young national service recruits.
Americans are living longer, have less retirement resources as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and have great experience and wisdom that would benefit our youth.
Moreover, as both the military and our college system downsize, there are vacant facilities in every state where such training could take place, putting to use what might otherwise become derelict infrastructure.
We should also design a modern equivalent of the successful post-World War II GI Bill for our young men and women when they finish their service.
Benefits could range from subsidized mortgages and low-interest loans to start a business to partial school tuition, subsidies for living expenses, and accelerated debt forgiveness.
According to a 2018 Public Opinion Strategies poll, about two-thirds of Americans would support a national service program.
And it would be good policy: alumni of existing service programs go on to complete four-year college at much higher rates than their non-service peers.
Most important, such a program would go a long way toward bridging Americans’ differences.
If our young people grow up believing that theirs is a divided country, we will have destroyed our future.
But if they can help unify our country, then our best days will be yet to come.
There is no more important challenge.

The US Election’s Chaos Quotient
NEW YORK – Opinion polls in the United States have long pointed to the strong possibility of a Democratic Party sweep in the election on November 3, with Joe Biden winning the presidency and Democrats gaining control of the US Senate and holding on to the House of Representatives, putting an end to divided government.
But if the election turns out to be mostly a referendum on US President Donald Trump, Democrats might win just the White House while failing to retake the Senate.
And one cannot rule out the possibility of Trump navigating a narrow path to an Electoral College victory, and of Republicans holding on to the Senate, thus reproducing the status quo.
More ominous is the prospect of a long-contested result, with both sides refusing to concede as they wage ugly legal and political battles in the courts, through the media, and on the streets.
In the contested 2000 election, it took until December 12 for the matter to be decided: the Supreme Court ruled in favor of George W. Bush, and his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, gracefully conceded.
Rattled by the political uncertainty, the stock market during this period fell by more than 7%.
This time, the uncertainty could last for much longer – perhaps even months – implying serious risks for the markets.
This nightmare scenario must be taken seriously, even if it currently seems unlikely.
While Biden has consistently led in the polls, so, too, had Hillary Clinton on the eve of the 2016 election.
It remains to be seen if there will be a slight surge in “shy” swing-state Trump voters who are unwilling to reveal their true preferences to pollsters.
Moreover, as in 2016, massive disinformation campaigns (foreign and domestic) are underway.
US authorities have warned that Russia, China, Iran, and other hostile foreign powers are actively trying to influence the election and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the balloting process.
Trolls and bots are flooding social media with conspiracy theories, fake news, deep fakes, and misinformation.
Trump and some of his fellow Republicans have embraced lunatic conspiracy theories like QAnon, and signaled their tacit support of white supremacist groups.
In many Republican-controlled states, governors and other public officials are openly deploying dirty tricks to suppress the votes of Democratic-leaning cohorts.
On top of all this, Trump has repeatedly claimed – falsely – that mail-in ballots cannot be trusted, because he anticipates that Democrats will comprise a disproportionate share of those not voting in person (as a pandemic-era precaution).
He also has refused to say that he will relinquish power if he loses, and has instead given a wink and a nod to right-wing militias (“stand back and stand by”) that have already been sowing chaos in the streets and plotting acts of domestic terrorism.
If Trump loses and resorts to claiming that the election was rigged, violence and civil strife could be highly likely.
Indeed, if the initial reported results on election night do not immediately indicate a sweep for the Democrats, Trump would almost certainly declare victory in battleground states before all mail-in ballots have been counted.
Republican operatives already have plans to suspend the counting in key states by challenging such ballots’ validity.
They will be waging these legal battles in Republican-controlled state capitals, local and federal courts stacked with Trump-appointed judges, a Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority, and a House of Representatives where, in the event of an Electoral College draw, Republicans hold the majority of state delegations.
At the same time, all of the white armed militias currently “standing by” could take to the streets to foment violence and chaos.
The goal would be to provoke leftist counter-violence, giving Trump a pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy federal law enforcement or the US military to restore “law and order” (as he has previously threatened to do).
With this endgame apparently in mind, the Trump administration has already designated several major Democratic-led cities as “anarchist hubs” that may need to be put down.
In other words, Trump and his cronies have made clear that they will use any means necessary to steal the election; and, given the wide range of tools at the executive branch’s disposal, they could succeed if early election results are close, rather than showing a clear Biden sweep.
To be sure, if early results on election night show Biden with a strong lead even in traditionally Republican states such as North Carolina, Florida, or Texas, Trump would find it much harder to contest the result for more than a few days, and he would concede sooner.
The problem is that anything short of a clear Biden landslide will leave an opening for Trump (and the foreign governments supporting him) to muddy the waters with chaos and disinformation as they maneuver to shift the final decision to more sympathetic venues such as the courts.
This degree of political instability could trigger a major risk-off episode in financial markets at a time when the economy is already slowing and the near-term prospects for additional policy stimulus remain grim.
If an election dispute drags on – perhaps into early next year – stock prices could fall by as much as 10%, government bond yields would decline (though they are already quite low), and the global flight to safety would push gold prices higher.
Usually in this type of scenario, the US dollar would strengthen; but, because this particular episode would have been triggered by US-based political chaos, capital might actually flee from the dollar, leaving it weaker.
One thing is certain: a highly contested election would cause further damage to America’s global image as an exemplar of democracy and the rule of law, eroding its soft power.
Particularly over the past four years, the country has increasingly come to be regarded as a political basket case.
While hoping that the chaotic outcomes outlined above do not come to pass – polls still show a strong lead for Biden – investors should be preparing for the worst, not just on election day but in the weeks and months thereafter.

The Dollar’s Last Days?
CAMBRIDGE – Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, recently suggested that replacing the dollar with the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights as the dominant reserve currency would bring greater stability to the global financial system.
The idea of reforming the system by introducing a supranational reserve currency is also, it appears, supported by Russia and other emerging markets.
And a United Nations advisory committee chaired by the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has argued for a new global reserve currency, possibly one based on the SDR.
Transforming the dollar standard into an SDR-based system would be a major break with a policy that has lasted more than 60 years.
The SDR was introduced 40 years ago to supplement what was then seen as an inadequate level of global reserves, and was subsequently enshrined in the IMF’s amended Articles of Agreement as the future principal reserve asset.
But the world soon became awash in dollars.
So, instead of becoming the principal reserve asset of the global system, the proportion of SDRs in global reserves shrank to a tiny fraction, rendering the SDR the monetary equivalent of Esperanto.
Although the euro, created in 1999, turned out to be a more serious competitor to the dollar, its share in total international reserves has probably remained below 30%, compared to 65% for the dollar (these shares are in part estimates, as China, the world’s largest holder of reserves, does not report the currency composition of its holdings).
There are two ways in which the dollar’s role in the international monetary system can be reduced.
One possibility is a gradual, market-determined erosion of the dollar as a reserve currency in favor of the euro.
But, while the euro’s international role – especially its use in financial markets – has increased since its inception, it is hard to envisage it overtaking the dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the foreseeable future.
Such an outcome is probably only possible if two conditions are met: first, the United Kingdom joins the euro area, and, second, the United States makes serious, confidence-sapping mistakes.
The latter condition may already have been partially met, but US policies to stabilize its financial system should help avoid a major dollar slide.
Moreover, the European Central Bank has repeatedly stated that it neither encourages nor discourages the euro’s international role.
With the dollar’s hegemony unlikely to be seriously undermined by market forces, at least in the short and medium-term, the only way to bring about a major reduction in its role as a reserve currency is by international agreement.
The Chinese proposal falls into this category.
One way to make the SDR the major reserve currency relatively soon would be to create and allocate a massive amount of new SDRs to the IMF’s members.
While the G-20 leaders have decided to support an SDR allocation of $250 billion, this will increase the share of SDRs in total international reserves to no more than 4%.
In order to make the SDR the principal reserve asset via the allocation route, close to $3 trillion in SDRs would need to be created, an unrealistic proposition.
But there is a more realistic way for the SDR’s importance to grow.
Back in 1980, the IMF came close to adopting a so-called SDR Substitution Account.
The idea was to permit countries whose official dollar holdings were larger than they were comfortable with to convert dollars into SDRs. Conversion would occur outside the market, and thus would not put downward pressure on the dollar.
Member countries would receive an asset that was more stable than the dollar, as it was based on a basket of currencies, thereby providing better protection against losses.
The plan fell apart when some major IMF shareholders could not accept the burden-sharing arrangements that would be necessary in case of losses due to exchange-rate movements.
The US also lost interest in the scheme as the dollar strengthened.
What are the chances of adopting a scheme of this kind today?
Is the US prepared to go along with a reform of the international monetary system that reduces the dollar’s role?
Until recently, I would have considered this unlikely.
But the changed international climate, and the possibility of a bout of severe dollar weakness, could convince the US to go along with a conversion scheme that would alleviate excessive pressure on the dollar.
And, apart from possible political considerations, large holders of dollars would find a substitution account attractive as a form of protection against strong fluctuations in the dollar’s value.
What about possible losses suffered by the Substitution Account?
This can be dealt with by setting aside part of the IMF’s large gold stock.
Even if an SDR Substitution Account is established, it is unlikely that the dollar’s share in international reserves would fall to an insignificant level.
The dollar will remain important for many countries as a vehicle for intervention in foreign-exchange markets, as well as for invoicing and for denominating internationally traded securities.
But one can envisage a system in which international reserves are held each in roughly equal shares of dollars, euros (assuming a further gradual increase in its share), and SDRs.
While there are currently other priorities, it would be useful for the IMF to study anew an SDR substitution account and similar schemes.
If it does not, the debate will take place elsewhere.

Ukraine's Road to Europe
"East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet," Rudyard Kipling famously said.
Ukraine may undoubtedly be of the East, but it is the East of Europe.
So when Ukraine regained its independence ten years ago, integration with Europe became the goal for many of us.
That road to Europe, however, wasn't paved with good intentions; it often wasn't paved at all.
Yet, as the results of the parliamentary elections held on March 31 demonstrate, Ukrainians remain determined to travel that road.
I am a social democrat who was never a Communist party member, though I achieved success as a lawyer in Soviet times.
I recognize that our Soviet "heritage" accounts for much of the hardship Ukraine faced in seeking its European vocation.
After the USSR collapsed, Ukraine possessed an inefficient and militarised industrial base and a blundering bureaucracy.
Its vast agricultural holdings were hamstrung by worn-out equipment and the inertia of Soviet state farming.
Rural people became mired in squalor.
Nowadays, low salaries make many lives here miserable, pensions are a joke, and the shadow economy is vast.
But our Soviet heritage does not excuse everything.
We muddled reform on our own. For we often sought to import tried and tested Western practices -- private property, the free market, competition, strict observance of human rights, the creation of civil society, representative democracy -- in diluted forms that would somehow help us maintain elements of Socialism.
Despite this nostalgic policymaking, enactment by the Supreme Rada (Ukraine's Parliament) of civil, criminal, land, family and economic legal codes over the years was something of a near revolution.
Indeed, although painful, acceptance of Western values by a society excluded for centuries from European history has gained momentum despite the fact that we often see ourselves as different from Western nations.
We think ourselves more open, sentimental, cordial, and family oriented, but also more disorganized and blase, at times irresponsible and lazy.
Still, we are Europeans.
You can see that on the streets and squares of Kiev.
Drivers now allow pedestrians to cross the street, as in Geneva or Munich (while in Moscow people must still dash aside from onrushing cars impervious to pedestrian safety).
Kiev now possesses a lively cafe life, and bright public places where people can relax and enjoy life.
Young people learn English, German, French; they study computers and suft the web in internet cafes.
But this is a lyrical digression of a lover of Kiev.
Lyrical observations aside, as a professional politician, I see deeper changes.
Over the last decade we moved from complete aversion to the idea of reform to a policy of mutant reforms pursued for corrupt motives, to the gradual adaptation of legitimate Western practices.
Administrative reform illustrates this well.
At first, reform of the state incited hostility among both bureaucrats and ordinary citizens.
A sharp and ill-considered reduction of the civil service began.
Here was reform "by the numbers": shrink the state, it was assumed, and government would run more smoothly.
No one took into account the fact that countries like France and Switzerland somehow manage to thrive with large states.
The critical factor is not the size of the state, but rather its organization and sense of purpose.
By recognizing that taking a chain saw to state bureaus does not automatically improve governance, we reached the second stage of our reform process.
Slowly, the state began to be reformed in a more thoughtful way.
New departments and state secretaries with clearly designed purposes were introduced.
This helped stabilize the work of government ministries.
In the beginning, the authority given to these new posts was somewhat overstated in order to make their powers effective.
Now their functioning has become more or less normal.
Ukrainians may at times resent these impersonal modern mechanisms, but they increasingly (if grudgingly) recognize them as necessary.
Sober-minded politician also accept this.
Only radicals and populists -- of which we retain too many -- can afford a devil-may-care attitude toward making the state function more efficiently.
Taming our radicals, and the radical impulse, has not been easy.
Why?
For too long Ukraine was a province of the USSR and Tsarist empire; the most important one, of course, but still a province.
This affected our mentality, for radicalism is a by-product of the provincials' inferiority complexes.
An overwhelming sense of inferiority, and our efforts to deny it, inspired the most scandalous aspects of Ukrainian political life.
The provincial cannot admit his inferiority and refuses to learn from others.
As we shrug off our provincial defensiveness, we become more willing to accept the best that others have to offer.
A century ago, the Ottoman Empire was derided as the "sick man of Europe."
Since 1991, Ukrainians have sensed that many Europeans see Ukraine as having inherited this sorry title.
Over the course of a decade we did, perhaps, make ourselves more ill through our own actions, but now we are recovering.
The recently concluded elections, which pushed the Communists out of their dominant position in the Rada and sharply curtailed the power of the "parties of power" that surround President Kuchma, pushed our provincial radicals to the fringes of our politics.
The parties of reform and of Europe triumphed.
Feeling ourselves outcasts or at least on the margins of Europe, we seek to build a society without outsiders or outcasts.
As a great (and already American at that time) writer Vladimir Nabokov wrote in the 1970s: "From all the decrees of nature the most remarkable one is, possibly, the survival of the weakest."
Walking that long, winding road to Europe has helped a weak new nation to strengthen and survive.

The Islamic Democratic Paradox
The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark (months ago) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran’s politics, has made “political Islam” a fundamental question of international diplomacy.
But a one-size-fits-all response won’t work.
Indeed, we need to abandon the idea that there is a holistic or global Islamist movement.
Political Islam of all colors has emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy, based on the struggle for national liberation, has evaporated due to their inability to resolve economic and social problems, establish the rule of law, and guarantee fundamental freedoms.
In Palestine, for example, the Islamists triumphed over Fatah because of years of bad governance under the harsh conditions spawned by Israeli occupation.
Successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the “Islamic alternative” to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah, and so have defended the status quo.
But repression of all Arab opposition movements by the region’s monarchs and secular dictators meant that “protection of the Mosque” became the only umbrella under which to engage politically.
Now political Islam can no longer be contained, because democracy cannot be built by driving underground parties that have a strong social base, as was tragically demonstrated in Algeria 15 years ago.
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to craft a transition that allows Islamists to participate in public life and encourages them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game.
There are already many examples of more or less conservative Islamist parties that are willing to play along.
It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform, including Lebanon, where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government, as well as Jordan and Morocco.
In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has become a strong force in parliament despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in last year’s elections.
In Iraq, free elections have revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents.
In Turkey, the transition to democracy led the Islamist Justice and Development Party to power.
That government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and initiated accession negotiations with the EU.
These Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda, even though some of the most conservative among them have adopted somewhat similar ideological positions.
The risk of political transitions that may lead to the victory of Islamist parties is a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they are to devise inclusive reform policies – in other words, policies that are the polar opposite of the type of democratic imposition practiced in occupied Iraq.
Indeed, one of the less fortunate consequences of the intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of a “clash of civilizations” between the West from Islam, which in turn serves to create a climate favorable to Islamist movements.
After all, political reform movements in the Muslim world emerged long before the US-led “war on terror,” and reformists were not waiting for the EU to become stronger to press for change.
These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11, 2001, and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act.
Nevertheless, the success of Muslim moderates may well depend on how the EU and the US respond to pressure for reform and how they decide to encourage change.
It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals.
This depends largely on the new Hamas government and its transformation into a democratic force that respects the rule of law, democracy, and international legality.
But it also depends on Israel and the international community, which must do all they can to ensure a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Supporting Palestinian democratization does not mean that the international community should not demand that Hamas abandon terror for once and for all, demilitarize, respect the Palestinian constitution, and accept the existence of the state of Israel.
But it also does not mean supporting sanctions that would hurt the Palestinian people after they have expressed their will democratically.
This would be a terrible mistake in any effort to consolidate Palestine’s new democracy, with a negative impact in other reforming countries in the Arab world.
Similarly, accepting the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in public life does not mean giving up on the political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra-conservative, and in some cases totalitarian, conceptions of society.
Combating racism, promoting tolerance, and respecting the religious sentiments of others does not mean that we need to question press freedom or accept Islamists’ demands for censorship, even when real religious sentiments are offended, as in the case of the Danish caricatures.
Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically.
That political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy, which allows all ideas to compete freely with each other.
Political Islam is a risk, but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent, case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy, not by denouncing the results of democratic choice.

Global Public Goods: The Missing Component
<d>
Toward a European Reconstruction Fund
BRUSSELS – Last week, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, having acknowledged that nobody is to blame for the COVID-19 crisis, agreed to a deal to mitigate its economic fallout.
The agreement includes €25 billion ($27.2 billion) in fresh funding for the European Investment Bank, €250 billion ($272 billion) for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), and €100 billion ($109 billion) for the creation of a new instrument through which the European Commission can help member states manage their looming unemployment crises.
All told, the package amounts to a substantial sum: around €500 billion in loans (when accounting for the leverage of the EIB’s programs).
Politically, any agreement on a eurozone-wide deal is a success in itself, considering the deep divisions of just a few weeks ago.
And, economically, the deal means that Europe is now supported by a combination of safety nets that will make another euro crisis highly unlikely.
As a result of the new agreement, if a eurozone member state faces difficulties financing the enormous outlays needed to support its economy during the COVID-19 lockdown period, it will have a number of options.
It could tap into the European Central Bank’s large new Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), or it could request a loan from the ESM, which is now constrained by fewer conditions.
Crucially, the new ESM program opens the door for the ECB to expend near-unlimited firepower through its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program.
Nonetheless, while these options provide for substantial liquidity support to member states, they do not address the issue of mounting debt, which already threatens to hamper growth for decades to come in many countries, not least Italy and Spain.
In our view, this critical issue should be addressed not through the mutualization of past or future debts, but with a common instrument that allows the European Union itself to incur the debt required to finance a massive investment and recovery program.
So far, the Eurogroup has offered only lip service to this idea. “Subject to guidance from Leaders,” its recent communiqué states, “discussions on the legal and practical aspects of such a fund, including its relation to the EU budget, its sources of financing and on innovative financial instruments, consistent with EU Treaties, will prepare the ground for a decision.”
Let’s get a few things straight.
For starters, EU debt already exists.
There is around €800 billion of it in the form of bonds issued by the European Commission, the EIB, and the ESM.
But this debt is used only to make more debt.
Because member states’ governments are responsible for their own spending, the EU is expected to help merely by pushing down interest rates.
But to ensure an economic recovery after the pandemic, we must abandon the idea that European loans should be used only to make more loans.
The time has come for genuine European spending financed through European borrowing.
The European Commission should issue consolidated annuities (or “EU Consols”) to finance a €1 trillion economic reconstruction package.
These instruments would constitute a safe investment in the future of the EU as a whole, which is exactly the message Europe needs to be sending right now.
Crucially, with EU Consols, no one would be investing in a package of mutualized European debt; rather, they would be investing in the future of the Union.
And, owing to the implicit support of the ECB and the Commission’s AAA rating, the annuities should have no problem attracting market interest.
In political terms, an EU annuity could play a critical role in a post-pandemic grand bargain.
Because it would not entail the mutualization of existing debt, it would operate wholly at the EU level, and thus would not affect any one country’s debt or spending levels.
Northern Europeans would not be assuming responsibility for southern Europeans’ debt.
Financing from the annuity would go toward a strictly European plan that is designed to serve all Europeans’ interests.
EU Consols also would not cost EU member states a penny.
To avoid using any of the funds that countries currently pay into the EU budget, the interest on the annuities would be paid with new EU-level levies on big polluters and tax evaders.
With taxes on digital services and non-recycled plastics, along with the current revenues from the carbon market (the European Emissions Trading System), the EU could raise around €26 billion per year.
Assuming a conservative interest rate of 2.5%, that would allow it to borrow more than €1 trillion for a recovery package.
And as a result, national contributions to the EU budget could be frozen at current levels, averting years of haggling over the collective budget.
The new European Reconstruction Fund would be fully owned and operated by the Commission, which in turn would be accountable only to the European Parliament.
The fund would focus on advancing the shared priorities of all European citizens.
After supporting the countries hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis, it would then go on to facilitate the private sector’s return to competitiveness, as well as investments in decarbonization, new transportation infrastructure, and research and innovation.
The pandemic has left Europe no choice.
Only by moving beyond the age-old fights over national budget contributions and debt can Europeans start investing in recovery.

Palestine after Abbas?
RAMALLAH – A political leader’s decision not to seek re-election usually triggers fervent discussion about potential heirs.
Yet, President Mahmoud Abbas’s withdrawal from the presidential election scheduled for January 24, 2010, has produced nothing of the kind in Palestine – not because of a dearth of leadership or a reluctance to mention possible successors, but because the presidency of the Palestinian Authority has become irrelevant.
Abbas’s withdrawal comes at a time when Palestinian frustration with the political process has rendered suspect the entire rationale behind the PA, established in the mid-1990’s, following the Oslo Accords.
The main component of the PLO’s agreement with Israel was a five-year interim period during which negotiations were expected to lead to an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Sixteen years later, it has become clear that the Israelis have made no effort to come to terms with Palestinian national aspirations – and that no effective effort has been made to convince them.
The number of illegal Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas has doubled, leaving Palestinians increasingly convinced that negotiations are a waste of time.
Many recall the preferred strategy of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir: “I would have conducted negotiations on autonomy for ten years, and in the meantime we would have reached a half-million people in the West Bank.”
Initially, the five-year interim agreement called for the election of a Palestinian Legislative Council and an executive leader whom the Israelis wanted to call a “chairman,” spurning the word “president.” Because Arabic makes no distinction between chairman and president, the Israelis accepted use of the Arabic word rayyes in the official English text.
Palestinian refugees in exile and other Palestinians living in the diaspora were not allowed to vote.
East Jerusalem Palestinians were allowed to vote only at the post office or at booths outside the city limits.
Abbas’s withdrawal merely confirms the obvious.
Another such election in the near future, including the one set for January, is unlikely to occur, mainly owing to the continuing rift between the PLO and Hamas, which controls Gaza.
Hamas participated in the 2006 legislative elections, which followed Israel’s military withdrawal from Gaza.
But for years Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups have rejected the Oslo process, on the grounds that free elections under Israeli occupation would be absurd.
Hamas has the power to stymie the vote and has indicated that it would do so.
Moreover, Abbas has not given up his positions as head of the PLO and leader of its biggest faction, Fatah, which remains in control in the West Bank.
Abbas cannot resign from his post for the foreseeable future, lest the Hamas-backed speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council take over.
At the same time, no PLO official is likely to seek the presidency without Abbas’s approval, which he will withhold until a new mechanism for ending the occupation is found.
The PLO will likely gain much from Abbas’s decision, because it de-emphasizes the status of the PA president and raises the profile of his post as chairman of the PLO’s executive committee.
That shift, in turn, clears the way for a generational change in leadership – and, more importantly, a transition to post-Oslo politics.
The PLO’s old guard – men like Yasser Arafat and Abbas, who led the liberation organization from exile and returned home with the Oslo Accords – dominated the Palestinian political landscape up to now.
After they depart the scene, Palestinian leaders who were born under occupation and spent time in Israeli prisons will most likely fill the vacuum.
The most prominent such figure is Marwan Barghouti, the leader of the student movement at Birzeit University in the 1980’s and one of the main organizers of the First Intifada, resulting in his deportation by Israel in the late 1980’s.
In 2002, he was arrested and sentenced to a long prison term on charges that he led the Second Intifada, which had begun two years earlier, and ordered some of its military attacks.
Despite being imprisoned, Barghouti was recently elected to Fatah’s central council, and a number of others who spent time in Israeli prisons will join him.
One is Jibril Rajoub, imprisoned for 19 years and deported in the First Intifada, only to return to lead one of the security services after the PA was established.
Another is Mahmoud Dahlan, also an ex-prisoner and former security official, although the loss of Gaza to Hamas, for which many Palestinians hold him partly responsible, has dimmed his leadership prospects.
Finally, there is Nasser al-Qudwa, the former PLO representative at the United Nations.
Qudwa is a dark-horse candidate to succeed Abbas – a possible compromise figure who has never been directly involved in security or military activities.
For many Palestinians, Qudwa, a soft-spoken, multi-lingual nationalist (and Arafat’s nephew), presents an acceptable face for Palestine locally and internationally.
The coming months will reveal whether we are, indeed, witnessing the dawn of the post-Oslo era in Palestinian politics, and whether a new leader, with new supporters, will be required to revive the Palestinian cause.
Whoever emerges on top will have to present an effective strategy to end four decades of military occupation and bring about a truly independent state that a majority of Palestinians can embrace.

Cyber War and Peace
CAMBRIDGE – Two years ago, a piece of faulty computer code infected Iran’s nuclear program and destroyed many of the centrifuges used to enrich uranium.
Some observers declared this apparent sabotage to be the harbinger of a new form of warfare, and United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has warned Americans of the danger of a “cyber Pearl Harbor” attack on the US.
But what do we really know about cyber conflict?
The cyber domain of computers and related electronic activities is a complex man-made environment, and human adversaries are purposeful and intelligent.
Mountains and oceans are hard to move, but portions of cyberspace can be turned on and off by throwing a switch.
It is far cheaper and quicker to move electrons across the globe than to move large ships long distances.
The costs of developing those vessels – multiple carrier task forces and submarine fleets – create enormous barriers to entry, enabling US naval dominance.
But the barriers to entry in the cyber domain are so low that non-state actors and small states can play a significant role at low cost.
In my book The Future of Power, I argue that the diffusion of power away from governments is one of this century’s great political shifts. & Cyberspace is a perfect example.
Large countries like the US, Russia, Britain, France, and China have greater capacity than other states and non-state actors to control the sea, air, or space, but it makes little sense to speak of dominance in cyberspace.
If anything, dependence on complex cyber systems for support of military and economic activities creates new vulnerabilities in large states that can be exploited by non-state actors.
Four decades ago, the US Department of Defense created the Internet; today, by most accounts, the US remains the leading country in terms of its military and societal use.
But greater dependence on networked computers and communication leaves the US more vulnerable to attack than many other countries, and cyberspace has become a major source of insecurity, because, at this stage of technological development, offense prevails over defense there.
The term “cyber attack”covers a wide variety of actions, ranging from simple probes to defacing Web sites, denial of service, espionage, and destruction.
Similarly, the term “cyber war” is used loosely to cover a wide range of behaviors, reflecting dictionary definitions of war that range from armed conflict to any hostile contest (for example, “war between the sexes” or “war on drugs”).
At the other extreme, some experts use a narrow definition of cyber war: a “bloodless war” among states that consists solely of electronic conflict in cyberspace.
But this avoids the important interconnections between the physical and virtual layers of cyberspace.
As the Stuxnet virus that infected Iran’s nuclear program showed, software attacks can have very real physical effects.
A more useful definition of cyber waris hostile action in cyberspace whose effects amplify or are equivalent to major physical violence.
In the physical world, governments have a near-monopoly on large-scale use of force, the defender has an intimate knowledge of the terrain, and attacks end because of attrition or exhaustion.
Both resources and mobility are costly.
In the cyber world, by contrast, actors are diverse (and sometimes anonymous), physical distance is immaterial, and some forms of offense are cheap.
Because the Internet was designed for ease of use rather than security, attackers currently have the advantage over defenders.
Technological evolution, including efforts to “reengineer” some systems for greater security, might eventually change that, but, for now, it remains the case.
The larger party has limited ability to disarm or destroy the enemy, occupy territory, or use counterforce strategies effectively.
Cyber war, though only incipient at this stage, is the most dramatic of the potential threats.
Major states with elaborate technical and human resources could, in principle, create massive disruption and physical destruction through cyber attacks on military and civilian targets.
Responses to cyber war include a form of interstate deterrence through denial and entanglement, offensive capabilities, and designs for rapid network and infrastructure recovery if deterrence fails.
At some point, it may be possible to reinforce these steps with certain rudimentary norms and arms control, but the world is at an early stage in this process.
If one treats so-called “hacktivism” by ideological groups as mostly a disruptive nuisance at this stage, there remain four major categories of cyber threats to national security, each with a different time horizon: cyber war and economic espionage are largely associated with states, and cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors.
For the US, the highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime, but over the next decade or so, war and terrorism could become greater threats than they are today.
Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap.
In the view of Admiral Mike McConnell, America’s former director of national intelligence, “Sooner or later, terror groups will achieve cyber-sophistication.
It’s like nuclear proliferation, only far easier.”
The world is only just beginning to see glimpses of cyber war – in the denial-of-service attacks that accompanied the conventional war in Georgia in 2008, or the recent sabotage of Iranian centrifuges.
States have the greatest capabilities, but non-state actors are more likely to initiate a catastrophic attack.
A “cyber 9/11” may be more likely than the often-mentioned “cyber Pearl Harbor.”
It is time for states to sit down and discuss how to limit this threat to world peace.

Stagnation by Design
NEW YORK – Soon after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, I warned that unless the right policies were adopted, Japanese-style malaise – slow growth and near-stagnant incomes for years to come – could set in.
While leaders on both sides of the Atlantic claimed that they had learned the lessons of Japan, they promptly proceeded to repeat some of the same mistakes.
Now, even a key former United States official, the economist Larry Summers, is warning of secular stagnation.
The basic point that I raised a half-decade ago was that, in a fundamental sense, the US economy was sick even before the crisis: it was only an asset-price bubble, created through lax regulation and low interest rates, that had made the economy seem robust.
Beneath the surface, numerous problems were festering: growing inequality; an unmet need for structural reform (moving from a manufacturing-based economy to services and adapting to changing global comparative advantages); persistent global imbalances; and a financial system more attuned to speculating than to making investments that would create jobs, increase productivity, and redeploy surpluses to maximize social returns.
Policymakers’ response to the crisis failed to address these issues; worse, it exacerbated some of them and created new ones – and not just in the US.
The result has been increased indebtedness in many countries, as the collapse of GDP undermined government revenues.
Moreover, underinvestment in both the public and private sector has created a generation of young people who have spent years idle and increasingly alienated at a point in their lives when they should have been honing their skills and increasing their productivity.
On both sides of the Atlantic, GDP is likely to grow considerably faster this year than in 2013.
But, before leaders who embraced austerity policies open the champagne and toast themselves, they should examine where we are and consider the near-irreparable damage that these policies have caused.
Every downturn eventually comes to an end.
The mark of a good policy is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been.
The mark of the austerity policies that many governments embraced is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary, with long-lasting consequences.
Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita is lower in most of the North Atlantic than it was in 2007; in Greece, the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23%.
Germany, the top-performing European country, has recorded miserly 0.7% average annual growth over the last six years.
The US economy is still roughly 15% smaller than it would have been had growth continued even on the moderate pre-crisis trajectory.
But even these numbers do not tell the full story of how bad things are, because GDP is not a good measure of success.
Far more relevant is what is happening to household incomes.
Median real income in the US is below its level in 1989, a quarter-century ago; median income for full-time male workers is lower now than it was more than 40 years ago.
Some, like the economist Robert Gordon, have suggested that we should adjust to a new reality in which long-term productivity growth will be significantly below what it has been over the past century.
Given economists’ miserable record – reflected in the run-up to the crisis – for even three-year predictions, no one should have much confidence in a crystal ball that forecasts decades into the future.
But this much seems clear: unless government policies change, we are in for a long period of disappointment.
Markets are not self-correcting.
The underlying fundamental problems that I outlined earlier could get worse – and many are.
Inequality leads to weak demand; widening inequality weakens demand even more; and, in most countries, including the US, the crisis has only worsened inequality.
The trade surpluses of northern Europe have increased, even as China’s have moderated.
Most important, markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing, for example, was anything but smooth; on the contrary, it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the Great Depression.
This time is no different, but in some ways it could be worse: the sectors that should be growing, reflecting the needs and desires of citizens, are services like education and health, which traditionally have been publicly financed, and for good reason.
But, rather than government facilitating the transition, austerity is inhibiting it.
Malaise is better than a recession, and a recession is better than a depression.
But the difficulties that we are facing now are not the result of the inexorable laws of economics, to which we simply must adjust, as we would to a natural disaster, like an earthquake or tsunami.
They are not even a kind of penance that we have to pay for past sins – though, to be sure, the neoliberal policies that have prevailed for the past three decades have much to do with our current predicament.
Instead, our current difficulties are the result of flawed policies.
There are alternatives.
But we will not find them in the self-satisfied complacency of the elites, whose incomes and stock portfolios are once again soaring.
Only some people, it seems, must adjust to a permanently lower standard of living.
Unfortunately, those people happen to be most people.

Climate Policy Is Social Policy
ISLAMABAD – The number of days each year when the temperature exceeds 50°C (122°F) has doubled since the 1980s, and occurs in more places than ever.
This extreme heat is having a dramatic effect on the health of humans, animals, and the environment.
According to a recent World Bank report on climate migration, over the next 30 years, 216 million people could be displaced by rising temperatures, water scarcity, and declining crop productivity.
They will be forced to abandon their communities and livelihoods in search of better prospects.
When the temperature in Jacobabad, Pakistan reached 52°C in June, those with the means to leave did so.
The poor had no choice but to try to survive in the face of punishing heat and water shortages.
This story of haves and have-nots rings true around the world.
It demonstrates how poor and marginalized communities often are the most affected by the manifestations of climate change.
While it is still possible to slow and potentially correct the climate emergency if immediate and dramatic action is taken, some changes to the environment already are unavoidable.
To ensure that people can continue to live in cities like Jacobabad, radical action on global warming must be paired with progressive poverty reduction policies to build stronger communities.
Pakistan has placed these twin objectives – social welfare and climate action – at the heart of its long-term legislative agenda.
Initiatives are being developed to bring communities together while restoring vital ecosystems.
The Ten Billion Tree Tsunami already is creating green jobs while laying the groundwork for a healthy, sustainable economy.
Pakistan’s efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change go hand in hand with the goal of creating the largest social protection program in the country’s history.
Called Ehsaas (“compassion” in Urdu), the program aims to tackle the acute needs of those most at risk while investing in long-term equality and prosperity.
Providing a safety net that prevents the poorest from falling through the cracks is the key to building a brighter future for everyone.
Because Pakistan is on the frontline of climate change, any social welfare strategy must include mechanisms that are sufficiently flexible to respond to disasters.
Ehsaas recently completed Pakistan’s largest-ever socioeconomic registry, gathering data on 38 million households.
Thanks to the information in the registry, Ehsaas will be better placed to predict which families and farmers are vulnerable to disasters like droughts and provide cash payments accordingly.
We know this system works – when lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were implemented virtually overnight, emergency cash assistance was delivered through the Ehsaas Emergency Cash initiative, keeping 15 million families from falling deeper into poverty.
Many of Pakistan’s poorest live from hand to mouth, and they remain the first and hardest hit by spikes in food prices, which climate change is exacerbating.
Extreme weather events limit the ability of families living at or below the poverty line to acquire nutritious food.
A lack of access to healthy food results in childhood stunting, which has a significant, long-term effect on overall development, including brain growth.
We know that a child’s access to nutritious food and health care in the first 1,000 days of life plays a crucial role in determining overall lifetime health.
To protect children and families from the negative effects of poor nutrition and intergenerational poverty, Pakistan is investing in a conditional cash transfer program, which is being expanded throughout the country despite the financial constraints caused by the pandemic.
Poor health also undermines households’ ability to break the cycle of poverty.
When people must spend time and money on health care instead of food, education, or saving for unexpected emergencies, they are less prepared to respond to the next crisis.
Since the launch of the Sehat Insaf Card in 2016, Pakistan’s welfare program has provided health care free of charge to more than 7.9 million families (or more than 50 million individuals).
Providing access to quality health care irrespective of financial means is a way to build stronger communities and create a pathway to prosperity.
The climate crisis and endemic poverty are complex issues requiring policy frameworks that address multiple factors.
There are obvious anti-poverty tools – including access to health services, quality education, and nutritional support – that can help.
But taking significant steps to reduce the effects of climate change, like adopting carbon capture technology, developing affordable long-lasting batteries, and managing migration, calls for moral leadership, fiscal support, and global solidarity.
Pakistan aims to show that it is possible to lift people out of poverty while also tackling the climate emergency.
As a global community, we face many challenges in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and adapting to a warming planet, and the challenges of reducing poverty and creating an inclusive sustainable economy are no less daunting.
But we know that it is no longer possible to achieve one without the other.

Fixing the Right Hole
LONDON – The “laws of holes” are as unforgiving as the laws of physics. If you find yourself in a hole and want to get out, the first thing you do is to stop digging.
If you confront a number of holes to fix and want to know which to fix first, you choose the one which poses the greater danger.
These laws are particularly true when applied to government finance.
When John Maynard Keynes talked of persistent under-employment, he did not mean that, following a big shock, economies stay frozen at one unchanging level of depressed activity.
But he did think that, without external stimulus, recovery from the lowest point would be slow, uncertain, weak, and liable to relapse.
His “under-employment equilibrium” is a form of gravitational pull rather than a fixed condition.
This is a situation that Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, described as a “quasi-recession,” a better term than “double-dip recession.”
It denotes an anemic recovery, with bursts of excitement punctuated by collapses.
It is the situation we confront today.
Contrary to Keynes, orthodox economists believe that, after a big shock, economies will “naturally” return to their previous rate of growth, provided that governments balance their budgets and stop stealing resources from the private sector. The theory underlying this way of thinking was set out in the July Bulletin of the European Central Bank.
Debt-financed public spending, the ECB argued, will “crowd out” private spending by causing real interest rates to rise or by leading households to increase their saving because they expect to pay higher taxes later.
Either way, a fiscal stimulus will not only have no effect; the economy will be worse off, because public spending is inherently less efficient than private spending.
The Bulletin’s authors do not believe that a “crowding out” of this type actually happened over the last two years.
On the contrary, as they explain, if there are unemployed resources, extra government spending can “crowd in” private spending by creating additional demand that would otherwise not exist.
Summarizing the evidence, the Bulletin finds that fiscal-stimulus programs in the eurozone have caused GDP to be 1.3% higher in 2009-2010 than it otherwise would have been.
Evidence for the positive impact of fiscal stimulus is even stronger in the US.
In a recent paper, the economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandl found that the total stimulus policy adopted in 2009-2010 (including TARP, the much-maligned financial-sector bailout scheme) averted another Great Depression.
Fiscal expansion alone caused GDP in the US to be 3.4% higher over 2009-2010 than it otherwise would have been.
Yet the budget cutters have a fallback position.
The problem with fiscal stimulus, they say, is that it destroys confidence in government finances, thereby impeding recovery.
So a credible deficit-reduction program is needed now to “consolidate recovery.”
This will have a positive wealth effect and increase private consumption. But why on earth should consumers believe that cutting a deficit, and raising taxes now, will lead to tax cuts later?
One implausible hypothesis follows another.
Fiscal consolidation, its advocates claim, “might” lead investors to expect improvement on the supply side of the economy.
But it is unemployment, loss of skills and self-confidence, and investment rationing that are hitting the supply side.
We are told that the “credible announcement and implementation” of fiscal-consolidation strategy “may” diminish the risk premium associated with government debt.
This will reduce real interest rates and make “crowding in” of private spending more likely.
But real interest rates on long-term government debt in the US, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom are already close to zero.
Not only do investors view the risks of depression and deflation as greater than those of default, but bonds are being preferred to equities for the same reason.
Finally, the reduction of governments’ borrowing requirements “might” have a beneficial effect on output in the long run, owing to lower long-term interest rates.
Of course, low long-term interest rates are necessary for recovery.
But so are profit expectations, and these depend on buoyant demand.
No matter how cheap it is for businessmen to borrow, they will not do so if they see no demand for their products.
The ECB’s arguments look to me like scraping the bottom of the intellectual barrel.
The truth is that it is not fear of government bankruptcy, but governments’ determination to balance the books, that is reducing business confidence by lowering expectations of employment, incomes, and orders.
The problem is not the hole in the budget; it is the hole in the economy.
Let us assume, though, that the ECB is right and that fears of “unsound finance” are holding back economic recovery.
The question still needs to be asked: are such fears rational?
Are they not exaggerated in today’s circumstances (except, possibly, in countries like Greece)?
If so, is it not the duty of official bodies like the ECB to challenge irrational beliefs about the economy, rather than pander to them?
The trouble is that the current crisis finds governments intellectually disabled, because their theory of the economy is a mess.
Events and common sense drove them to deficit finance in 2009-2010, but they have not abandoned the theory that depressions cannot happen, and that deficits are therefore always harmful (except in war!).
So now they vie with each other in their haste to cut off the lifeline that they themselves extended.
Policymakers need to re-learn their Keynes, explain him clearly, and apply his lessons, not invent pseudo-rational arguments for prolonging the recession.

An Unstable Economic Order?
LAGUNA BEACH – The retreat of the advanced economies from the global economy – and, in the case of the United Kingdom, from regional trading arrangements – has received a lot of attention lately.
At a time when the global economy’s underlying structures are under strain, this could have far-reaching consequences.
Whether by choice or necessity, the vast majority of the world’s economies are part of a multilateral system that gives their counterparts in the advanced world – especially the United States and Europe – enormous privileges.
Three stand out.
First, because they issue the world’s main reserve currencies, the advanced economies get to exchange bits of paper that they printed for goods and services produced by others.
Second, for most global investors, these economies’ bonds are a quasi-automatic component of portfolio allocations, so their governments’ budget deficits are financed in part by other countries’ savings.
The advanced economies’ final key advantage is voting power and representation.
They command either veto power or a blocking minority in the Bretton Woods institutions (the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), which gives them a disproportionate influence on the rules and practices that govern the international economic and monetary system.
And, given their historical dominance of these organizations, their nationals are de facto assured the top positions.
These privileges don’t come for free – at least they shouldn’t.
In exchange, the advanced economies are supposed to fulfill certain responsibilities that help ensure the system’s functioning and stability.
But recent developments have cast doubts on whether the advanced economies are able to hold up their end of this bargain.
Perhaps the most obvious example is the 2008 global financial crisis.
The result of excessive risk-taking and lax regulation in the advanced economies, the financial system’s near-meltdown disrupted global trade, threw millions into unemployment, and almost tipped the world into a multi-year depression.
But there have been other lapses, too.
For example, political obstacles to comprehensive economic policymaking in many advanced economies have undermined the implementation of structural reforms and responsive fiscal policies in recent years, holding back business investment, undermining productivity growth, worsening inequality, and threatening future potential growth.
Such economic lapses have contributed to the emergence of anti-establishment political movements that are looking to change – or are already changing – long-established cross-border trade relations, including those within the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Meanwhile, a prolonged and excessive reliance on monetary policy, including direct central-bank involvement in market activities, has distorted asset prices and contributed to resource misallocation.
And the advanced economies – particularly Europe – have shown little appetite for reforming outdated elements of governance and representation at the international financial institutions, despite major changes in the global economy.
The result of all this is a multilateral system that is less effective, less collaborative, less trusted, and more vulnerable to ad hoc tinkering.
Against this background, it should not be surprising that globalization and regionalization no longer command the degree of support they once did – or that some rising political movements on both sides of the Atlantic are condemning both concepts to win more support for their own causes.
It is not yet clear whether this is a temporary and reversible phenomenon or the beginning of a protracted challenge to the functioning of the global economy.
What is clear is that it is affecting two important relationships.
The first is the relationship between small and large economies.
For a long time, small, well-managed, and open economies were the leading beneficiaries of the Bretton Woods system and, more generally, of multilateralism.
Their size not only made them crave access to outside markets; it also made other market actors more willing to integrate them into regional pacts, owing to their limited displacement potential.
Membership in effective international institutions brought these countries into consequential global policy discussions, while their own capabilities allowed them to exploit opportunities in cross-border production and consumption chains.
But, at a time of surging nationalism, these small and open economies, however well managed, are likely to suffer.
Their trading relationships are less stable; the trade pacts on which they depend are vulnerable; and their participation in global policy discussions is less assured.
The second relationship is that between the Bretton Woods institutions and parallel institutional arrangements.
For example, while they pale in significance to, say, the World Bank, China-led institutions have proved appealing to a growing number of countries; most US allies have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, despite American opposition.
Similarly, bilateral payment agreements – which, not long ago, most countries would have opposed via the IMF, owing to their inconsistency with multilateralism – are proliferating.
The concern is that these alternative approaches could undermine, rather than reinforce, a predictable and beneficial rules-based system of cross-border interactions.
The Bretton Woods organizations, instituted after World War II to maintain stability, risk losing their influence, and the countries with the clout to bolster them seem unwilling at this stage to press ahead boldly with the needed reforms.
If these tendencies continue, developing countries will probably suffer the most; but they won’t be alone.
In the short term, the world economy would face slower economic growth and the risk of greater financial instability.
In the longer term, it would confront the threat of systemic fragmentation and proliferating trade wars.

Flattening the COVID-19 Curve in Developing Countries
LEE, MASSACHUSETTS – COVID-19 is ravaging advanced economies such as Italy, France, Spain, and the United States.
Beyond the deaths and human suffering, markets are discounting a catastrophic recession accompanied by massive defaults, as expressed in the radical repricing of corporate credit risk by financial markets.
As horrific as this sounds, the situation in the advanced economies is likely to be much more benign than what developing countries are facing, not only in terms of the disease burden, but also in terms of the economic devastation they will face.
And while two academic communities – public-health experts and macroeconomists – are starting to talk to each other, unfortunately the conversation has mostly involved only the advanced countries.
The public health community has made the differential equations that govern contagion almost mainstream.
People now talk about the role of the R0 factor (the average number of new infections caused by each infected person) and about the need to flatten the contagion curve through social distancing and lockdowns.
Macroeconomists initially saw the pandemic as a negative demand shock that would need to be countered by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to support aggregate spending.
Soon enough, many of them realized that this shock is different.
Unlike the 2008 global financial crisis, which led to a collapse in demand, the COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a supply shock.
That changes everything.
If output is collapsing because people do not want to or cannot spend, adding spending power may help.
But if Broadway theaters, universities, schools, sports arenas, hotels, and airlines are shut down to stop the spread of the virus, giving money to people will not reignite those industries: they are not lacking in demand.
They are shut down as part of the public health policies implemented to flatten the curve.
If firms are not producing because their workers are locked down, boosting demand will not magically make goods appear.
As a consequence, macroeconomists are now focusing on how to make social distancing and lockdowns tolerable and limit the damage that the supply shock will generate.
In the US and the United Kingdom, governments are planning large fiscal packages to expand health-care provision, protect payrolls, provide additional unemployment insurance, delay tax payments, avert unnecessary bankruptcies, shore up the financial system, and help firms and households survive the storm.
But one frequently unstated assumption of this approach is that governments will be able to mobilize the necessary resources, essentially by borrowing more, if needed, from their own central banks, as they implement quantitative easing (QE).
Economists refer to governments’ ability to borrow as fiscal space.
In short, the flatter you want the contagion curve to be, the more you will need to lock down your country – and the more fiscal space you will require to mitigate the deeper recession that will result.
That leaves developing countries in the lurch.
Even in the best of times, many of them have precarious access to finance, and resort to the printing press leads to a run on the currency and an inflationary spike.
And these are not the best of times.
Most developing countries rely for foreign income on a combination of commodity exports, tourism, and remittances: all are expected to collapse, leaving economies short of dollars and governments short of tax revenues.
At the same time, access to international financial markets has been cut off as investors rush to the safety of US and other rich-country government-issued assets.
In other words, just when developing countries need to manage the pandemic, most have seen their fiscal space evaporate and face large funding gaps.
The standard prescription for revenue collapses and external financing problems is a combination of austerity (to bring spending in line with income), devaluation (to make scarce foreign exchange dearer), and international financial assistance to smooth the adjustment.
But this would leave countries with no resources to fight the virus and no means to protect the economy from the damaging effects of lockdown measures.
Moreover, the standard prescription is more inefficient if all countries try it at once, owing to negative spillovers on their neighbors.
Under these conditions, even if developing countries want to flatten the curve, they will lack the capacity to do so.
If people must choose between a 10% chance of dying if they go to work and assured starvation if they stay at home, they are bound to choose work.
To give countries the financial capacity to flatten the curve requires a level of financial support that will not be feasible with existing approaches and with international organizations’ current balance sheets.
To help manage the pandemic in the Global South, therefore, it is critical to recirculate the money that is fleeing the developing countries back to them.
To do that, the G7 and the G20 should consider several measures.
First, the US Federal Reserve has announced swap lines with the central banks of Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Korea, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Singapore, and Sweden.
This mechanism should be extended to many more countries.
If fear of default is an impediment, these funds could be intermediated by the International Monetary Fund, which should redesign its existing Rapid Financing Instrument to meet current needs.
Second, as central banks implement quantitative easing, they should purchase emerging-market bonds, especially the less risky ones, in order to free up more space for international financial institutions to focus on the more difficult cases.
Third, dollarized or euroized economies that do not have their own currency and hence a lender of last resort, such as Panama, El Salvador, and Ecuador, should be offered special financial facilities so that their central banks can backstop their banking systems.
Lastly, developed countries should not – as the European Union unfortunately has just done – impede or prohibit exports of tests, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.
Flattening the COVID-19 curve will require concerted economic action at the international level, especially with respect to developing countries.
Given the global nature of the problem, doing the right thing is the smartest thing to do.

Fascism with a Feminist Face
NEW YORK – Western feminism has made some memorable theoretical mistakes; a major one is the frequent assumption that, if women held the decision-making power in society, they would be “kinder and gentler” (a phrase devised for George H.W. Bush in 1988 to appeal to the female vote).
Indeed, so-called “second-wave” feminist theory abounds in assertions that war, racism, love of hierarchy, and general repressiveness belong to “patriarchy”; women’s leadership, by contrast, would naturally create a more inclusive, collaborative world.
The problem is that it has never worked out that way, as the rise of women to leadership positions in Western Europe’s far-right parties should remind us.
Leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front, Pia Kjaersgaard of Denmark’s People’s Party, and Siv Jensen of Norway’s Progress Party reflect the enduring appeal of neofascist movements to many modern women in egalitarian, inclusive liberal democracies.
The past is prologue: Wendy Lower’s recent book Hitler’s Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields adds more data to the long record of women embracing violent right-wing movements.
And the rise of far-right movements in Europe – often with women in charge – confronts us with the fact that the heirs to the fascism of the 1930’s have their own gender-based appeal.
One obvious reason for the success of women like Le Pen, Kjaersgaard, and Jensen is their value for packaging and marketing their parties.
Just as Bush sought to revamp the Republican Party’s “brand’ of cold-hearted elitism and hostility to women, so Europe’s far-right parties today must appeal to citizens by not seeming dangerously extreme and marginal.
How dangerous can the movement be, after all, if women are speaking for it?
Such parties come to be seen as more mainstream, and their appeal to traditionally harder-to-win women supporters receives a boost.
As Lower shows, the Nazis reached out with special programs – from organizing homemakers to colonizing the conquered Eastern territories – that gave working-class women things they craved: a sense of belonging to something larger than themselves (fascism’s eternal draw), backed by a complex official iconography in which the traditionally devalued roles of wife and mother held a crucial place in the national drama.
Young unmarried women who were sent to administer the neocolonial efforts in conquered Poland and other territories gained adventure, advanced professional training, and opportunity.
And, for all of these women, as for any subordinate group anywhere, fascism appealed to what social scientists call “last-place aversion”: the desire to outrank other groups.
Add, finally, the gendered appeal of the strong authority figure and rigid hierarchy, which attracts some women as much as some men, if in different psychodynamic ways.
As Sylvia Plath, the daughter of a German father, put it in her poem “Daddy”: “Every woman adores a Fascist/The boot in the face, the brute/Brute heart of a brute like you.”
Certainly, many of the same themes in far-right ideology attract the support of some women in Europe today.
And we can add the fact that right-wing movements benefit from the limitations of a postfeminist, post-sexual-revolution society, and the spiritual and emotional void produced by secular materialism.
Many lower-income women in Western Europe today – often single parents working pink-collar ghetto jobs that leave them exhausted and without realistic hope of advancement – can reasonably enough feel a sense of nostalgia for past values and certainties.
For them, the idealized vision of an earlier age, one in which social roles were intact and women’s traditional contribution supposedly valued, can be highly compelling.
And, of course, parties that promote such a vision promise women – including those habituated to second-class status at work and the bulk of the labor at home – that they are not just faceless atoms in the postmodern mass.
Rather, you, the lowly clerical worker, are a “true” Danish, Norwegian, or French woman.
You are an heiress to a noble heritage, and thus not only better than the mass of immigrants, but also part of something larger and more compelling than is implied by the cog status that a multiracial, secular society offers you.
The attraction of right-wing parties to women should be examined, not merely condemned.
If a society does not offer individuals a community life that takes them beyond themselves, values only production and the bottom line, and opens itself to immigrants without asserting and cherishing what is special and valuable about Danish, Norwegian, or French culture, it is asking for trouble.
For example, upholding the heritage of the Enlightenment and progressive social ideals does not require racism or pejorative treatment of other cultures; but politically correct curricula no longer even make the attempt to do so.
Until we stop regarding cultural pluralism as being incompatible with the defense of legitimate universal values, fascist movements will attract those who need the false hope and sense of self-worth that such movements offer, regardless of gender.

Did Humans Invent Modernity?
Fossil remains and genetic data suggest that modern humans come from Africa, and in the last decade anthropologists, archaeologists, linguists, and other scientists have tended to identify our species' biological origin with the origin of modern intelligence.
The idea is quite simple.
The process that produced our species in Africa granted it a number of advantages - syntactical language, advanced cognition, symbolic thinking - that favored its spread throughout the world and determined its eventual evolutionary success.
If, however, such advantages were dramatic and mainly determined by biological change, we should expect to find them reflected in the material culture produced by these early, anatomically modern populations.
Complex technologies, regional trends in the style and decoration of tools, use of pigments, abstract and representational depiction, burials, grave goods, and personal ornaments are among the more common long-lasting creations that attest to the complex symbolic nature of ethnographically recorded human cultures.
Specifically, we should find such archeological evidence at sites in Africa from between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago.
But what we see instead is a gradual emergence of behavioral innovations in and outside Africa between 300,000 and 20,000 years ago.
Moreover, anatomically modern populations shared a number of these innovations with Neanderthals, which many anthropologists and geneticists consider a different species, or a human type inherently incapable of reaching our cognitive level.
For example, elongated stone blades are found not only at Neanderthal sites in Europe and the Near East, but also at sites inhabited by Moderns in the Near East and Africa since at least 100,000 years ago.
Blade technologies then disappeared and reappeared cyclically in these areas, and in some regions, such as Australia, they only appeared a few thousand years ago.
Similarly, standardized tools produced by both Neanderthals and Moderns appeared 80,000 years ago.
Pigments, probably used in symbolic activities such as tattooing or body painting, are found at Southern African sites since 300,000 years, but also at contemporaneous and more recent Neanderthal sites in Europe.
The intentional character and symbolic significance of burials prior to 30,000 years ago, especially those of Neanderthals, remain the subject of intense debate.
But there is enough evidence to believe that both anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals began burying their dead 100,000 years ago - and probably before, as suggested by the recent dating at 160,000 years of a Neanderthal burial site at Tabun, Israel.
To be sure, sophisticated bone tools, such as harpoons, spear points, and awls, seem to have appeared in Africa 90,000 years ago, much earlier than in the rest of the world.
This also applies to such artifacts of modern humans as personal ornaments, with recently discovered shell beads dated at 75,000 years ago.
But these innovations do not seem to have been widespread.
Bone tools and beads are virtually absent from sites in Africa and the Near East inhabited by modern humans beginning 100,000 years ago, and few abstract engravings on bone and on fragments of ochre are found at African sites dated to 75,000 years ago.
Depictions of animals, human beings, and other natural features do not occur in the three records - Africa, Europe, and the Near East - before 40,000-30,000 years ago, and they appear much later in some areas than others.
In sum, certain behavioral innovations seem to appear in Africa between 10,000 and 30,000 years before Neanderthals express them.
But I doubt that this gap is evidence of different cognitive abilities.
After all, it took 7,000 years for agriculture to arrive in England from the Near East, and nobody would argue that the cognitive abilities of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from England were inferior to those of early agriculturalists.
This suggests that the trajectory of we "moderns" in our transformations since the end of the Ice Age has varied enormously in material culture.
Future archaeologists would do well not to seek an explanation of this variation in terms of visible differences in our skeletal biology!
"Modern" behavior may have appeared in different regions and among different groups of humans, much as would happen later in history with the inventions of agriculture, writing, and transport.
More fundamentally, behavior is certainly a significant component in determining a species' adaptation, geographic range, and mate-recognition system - all of which contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries.
But this does not imply that modern behavior must have developed in a single species.
Very close species may have similar behavioral systems and, in the case of our close predecessors, the shared features probably included many traits we have preferred to consider the monopoly of our species, including symbolic behavior.
The most important implication of believing that cultural modernity emerged in more than one species is that it largely eliminates the dichotomy that Western thought has traditionally detected between the natural world and human culture.
The archaeology of early modern and Neanderthal populations suggests that we are not the chosen people who received from God the light, the divine mandate to go forth, multiply, and eliminate their subhuman neighbors.
This is a liberating, as well as a humbling, prospect.
If the fact that we are the only human species left on earth is the result of an historical accident rather than Darwinian competition, we can open our minds and accept that we share some of our "culture" with both our living and no longer living relatives.
Our modernity is probably a part of their legacy as well.

Latin America’s Moment
NEW YORK – Much of the world’s attention is understandably focused on developments in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.
These regions represent the vast majority of global population and wealth, their geopolitics are the most stressful (and highly consequential), and in recent decades – if not centuries – they have accounted for most of what has constituted world history.
But an unintended consequence of this focus is that many governments, corporations, and people are missing much of what is going on in Latin America.
And much of what is going on in Latin America right now happens to be good.
This may not seem obvious.
Brazil, the region’s largest country, is in the middle of a severe political crisis; the incumbent president, Dilma Rousseff, may well be on trial while the Olympics are being staged in her country later this summer.
Meanwhile, the economy shrank by nearly 4% in 2015 and is projected to contract by a similar margin this year.
The impact of the Zika virus on public health is greater in Brazil than anywhere else.
Corruption is endemic and has compromised nearly everyone in public life.
But what is also extraordinary about Brazil is that all of this has thus far taken place without violence.
Just as important, the political process is being conducted according to constitutional requirements and led by judges acting independently.
Media of every sort are covering what is going on with great intensity.
The ability to self-correct is essential for any country, and having it may be what saves Brazil from past mistakes and mismanagement.
And, yes, Venezuela – a country blessed, or quite possibly cursed, with the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world – is in far worse shape.
The country’s economy and currency have plummeted along with the price of oil.
Inflation has soared.
Political dysfunction is severe, and civil unrest and large-scale internal violence cannot be ruled out.
Yet even here there is a bit of good news.
The political opposition won a large majority in the December 2015 parliamentary election.
And lower oil prices may trigger further political change, ultimately ushering in a government that begins the process of making Venezuela a country of institutions and laws, not personality cults and abuse of power.
More broadly, many of the most important trends in the region are on balance positive.
Mexico, for decades a one-party state, is now a robust democracy that has experienced several rotations of political leadership through the ballot box.
In addition, its economy is doing relatively well.
To be sure, challenges exist, particularly when it comes to addressing drug-related crime and violence, but these problems can be managed with sustained effort.
Colombia has emerged at long last from a prolonged civil conflict.
Thanks in part to assistance from the United States, the government was strong enough to make it clear to the country’s FARC rebels that they could not shoot their way into power.
The cease-fire is holding, and prospects for a peace agreement are good.
Meanwhile, the economy is growing at a 3% annual rate, lower than in the recent past, but still higher than in many emerging economies.
Argentina provides the most recent good news.
The new government, in its first six months, has taken a number of difficult steps to restore international confidence.
In no way does this minimize what the government must achieve to reduce inflation and restore sustainable growth, but there is a palpable sense that the country, now led by a talented team of technocrats, has turned the corner.
This is good news – and not just for Argentina, because what happens there will affect thinking and behavior elsewhere, particularly in Brazil.
Progress in Argentina would show that those who violate the law can be held accountable, that excessive state intervention in the economy leads to insolvency and promotes corruption, and that democracy and markets represent the future.
Cuba in ten years is more likely to resemble its more politically and economically open neighbors than vice versa.
Again, none of this is to say that Latin America lacks real problems and challenges.
On the contrary, it has plenty of both.
But for the most part, these are matters of political and economic governance, state capacity, and corruption within states.
Missing almost entirely are problems stemming from relations between states – geopolitics – that so dominate and plague other parts of the world.
This is a tremendous advantage, as it means that governments’ attention and resources can be focused on meeting domestic needs.
The Middle East is unraveling.
Asia is challenged by territorial disputes, the rise of Chinese power, and a reckless North Korea.
Europe is all but overwhelmed by refugees, terror, and Russian revanchism.
And Africa is being held back by civil conflicts, terrorism, and poor governance.
Latin America, by contrast, looks pretty good.
Indeed, if current trends persist, it could eventually replace Europe as the world region that others regard with more than a little admiration – or even envy.

Is Stimulus Still Necessary?
LONDON – Have stimulus packages brought the world’s traumatized economies back to life? Or have they set the scene for inflation and big future debt burdens?
The answer is that they may have done both. The key question now concerns the order in which these outcomes occur.
The theory behind the massive economic stimulus efforts that many governments have undertaken rests on the notion of the “output gap.” This is the difference between an economy’s actual output and its potential output.
If actual output is below potential output, this means that total spending is insufficient to buy what the economy can produce.
A stimulus is a government-engineered boost to total spending.
Government can either spend more money itself, or try to stimulate private spending by cutting taxes or lowering interest rates.
This will raise actual output to the level of potential output, thereby closing the output gap.
Some economists – admittedly a diminishing number – deny that there can ever be an output gap.
The economy, they argue, is always at full employment.
If there are less people working today than yesterday, it is because more people have decided not to work.
(By this reasoning, a lot of bankers have simply decided to take long holidays since last September’s financial meltdown.)
So today’s output is what people want to produce.
Attempts to stimulate it will produce only higher prices as people spend more money on the same quantity of goods and services.
A more sensible view is that today’s economy is not producing as much as it could and that there are many more people who want to work than there are jobs available.
So a stimulus will boost both output and employment.
But how large must such a stimulus be?
The United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that American output will be roughly 7% below its potential in the next two years, making this the worst recession since World War II.
American unemployment is projected to peak at 9.4% towards the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010, and is expected to remain above 7% at least until the end of 2011.
The US government has pledged $787 billion in economic stimulus, or about 7% of GDP.
Superficially this looks about right to close the output gap – if it is spent this year . But it is in fact a three year-program.
Some $584 billion is allocated for 2009-2010, leaving perhaps $300 billion of extra money for this year.
Even so, it is not clear how much of that will be spent.
This can be illustrated by a simple example.
Suppose the government distributes the extra cash to its citizens.
Some of it will be saved.
American household saving has shot up from 0% to 5% since the start of the recession, understandably to pay off debt.
Another part of the extra money will be spent on imports, which does nothing to stimulate spending on US output.
Let’s subtract 20% for these two items.
The bad news, then, is that only 80% of the $300 billion, or $240 billion, will be spent initially.
The good news is that this figure is multiplied over successive rounds of spending, as one person’s spending becomes another person’s income, and so on.
The value of the multiplier depends on assumptions about the size of the “gap,” “leakages” from the spending stream, and the effect of government programs on confidence.
Estimates vary from a multiplier of about two all the way down to zero.
A multiplier of two would generate $480 billion of extra spending, compared to a multiplier of one, which would generate just the initial $240 billion.
If the multiplier is zero, as conservative-minded economists believe, there will be no effect on output, only on prices.
A further source of stimulus is “quantitative easing,” or, more simply, printing money.
By buying government securities, the central bank injects cash into the banking system. This is intended to stimulate private spending by bringing down the rate of interest at which banks lend to their customers.
Extra hundreds of billions of dollars have been injected into banks worldwide by this means.
But the stimulus effect of quantitative easing is far less certain than even that of fiscal stimulus.
While the policy caused credit spreads to narrow and bond market liquidity to improve, many banks have been using the extra money to rebuild their balance sheets (the equivalent of increased household savings) rather than lending it to businesses and individuals.
Several conclusions can be drawn from what admittedly are back of the envelope calculations.
The first is that stimulus packages around the world arrested the slide into depression, and may have started a modest recovery.
Second, it is too early to scale down the stimulus, as Japan and the US seem ready to do.
As one British official said ahead of the G-20 summit in Italy in July, “We should start to prepare exit strategies, but we should start implementing them only when [we] are sure [we] have got a recovery that is entrenched and self-sustaining, and I don't think anyone is saying we are at that point yet.”
Third, existing policy, even if maintained, will not produce self-sustaining recovery.
At best, it offers the prospect of several years more of sub-normal activity.
A double round of stimulus packages is needed to counteract the real prospect of a double-dip recession.
The time to start worrying about inflation is when the recovery is entrenched.
To pay back the debt without strain, we need a booming economy. Talk of government spending cuts is premature.
‘A boom not a slump is the right time for austerity at the Treasury’ said Keynes.
He was right.

China’s Troubled Bourbons
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Sometimes the books that a country’s top leaders read can reveal a lot about what they are thinking.
So one of the books recently read by some of the incoming members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the country’s top decision-making body, may come as a surprise: Alexis de Tocqueville’s The Old Regime and the Revolution.
These leaders – to whom the CCP is about to pass the baton at its 18th congress, scheduled for November 8 – reportedly not only read Tocqueville’s diagnosis of social conditions on the eve of the French Revolution, but also recommended it to their friends.
If so, the obvious question is why China’s future rulers are circulating a foreign classic on social revolution.
The answer is not hard to find.
In all likelihood, these leaders sense, either instinctively or intellectually, an impending crisis that could imperil the CCP’s survival in the same way that the French Revolution ended Bourbon rule.
Telltale signs of anxiety are already visible.
Capital flight from China is now at a record high.
Polls of China’s dollar millionaires reveal that half of them want to emigrate.
Amid intensifying calls for democracy, China’s leader-in-waiting, Xi Jinping, reportedly met with the son of the late Hu Yaobang, a political reformer and icon of Chinese liberals.
While one should not read too much into such a visit, it is safe to say that China’s next leader knows that the Celestial Kingdom is becoming unsettled.
The idea that some sort of political crisis could engulf China in the coming years may strike many – particularly Western business and political elites, who have taken the CCP’s strength and durability for granted – as absurd.
In their minds, the Party’s hold on power seems indestructible.
But several emerging trends, unobserved or noted only in isolation, have greatly altered the balance of power between the CCP and Chinese society, with the former losing credibility and control and the latter gaining strength and confidence.
One such trend is the emergence of independent figures of public moral authority: successful businessmen, respected academics and journalists, famous writers, and influential bloggers.
To be sure, the CCP has followed a strategy of co-opting social elites since the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But people like Hu Shuli (who founded two influential business magazines), Pan Shiyi (an outspoken real-estate developer), Yu Jianrong (a social scientist and public intellectual), Wu Jinglian (a leading economist), and the bloggers Han Han and Li Chengpeng, achieved success on their own, and have maintained their integrity and independence.
Taking advantage of the Internet and weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter), they have become champions of social justice.
Their moral courage and social stature have, in turn, helped them to build mass support (measured by the tens of millions of their weibo followers).
Their voices often reframe the terms of social-policy debate and put the CCP on the defensive.
For the Party, this development is clearly worrying.
It is now ceding the commanding heights of Chinese politics to autonomous representatives of social forces that it cannot control.
The CCP’s monopoly of public moral authority is long gone, and now its monopoly of political power is at risk as well.
That loss is compounded by the collapse of the Party’s credibility among ordinary people.
To be sure, the CCP’s opacity, secrecy, and penchant for untruth always implied a credibility problem.
But, in the last decade, a series of scandals and crises – involving public safety, adulterated food and drugs, and environmental pollution – has thoroughly destroyed what little credibility lingered.
One such episode was the sale of tainted baby formula in 2008.
Official suppression of news about the incident (which occurred just before the Beijing Olympics) not only led to the deaths of many infants, but also left ordinary Chinese even more distrustful of the authorities.
On the environmental front, perhaps the most telling evidence is Beijing residents’ preference for the United States Embassy’s air-quality readings over those of their government.
For a regime whose credibility is gone, the costs of maintaining power are exorbitant – and eventually unbearable – because it must resort to repression more frequently and heavily.
But repression is yielding diminishing returns for the Party, owing to a third revolutionary development: the dramatic decline in the cost of collective action.
Autocracies stay in power if they can divide the population and prevent organized opposition activities.
Although the CCP faces no organized opposition today, it confronts virtually organized protest activities on a daily basis.
Based on estimates by Chinese sociologists, 500 riots, collective protests, and strikes occur each day, up almost four-fold from a decade ago.
With widespread ownership of mobile phones and Internet-connected computers, it is far easier than ever before to organize supporters and allies.
Moreover, growing defiance reflects the public’s perception that the authorities have grown afraid of the people and tend to yield to their demands when confronted by angry protesters.
In some of the highest-profile collective protests in the past year – the land dispute in Wukan in Guangdong and the environmental protests in Dalian, Shifang, and Qidong – the government backed down.
If governing by fear is no longer tenable, China’s new rulers must start fearing for the CCP's future.
As the country’s silent political revolution continues to unfold, the question is whether they will heed its signs, or attempt to maintain an order that – like the French monarchy – cannot be saved.

The Road to Arab Democracy
JERUSALEM – During the turmoil of the French Revolution, a popular saying arose: “How beautiful was the republic – under the monarchy.” The Revolution aimed at achieving Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.
Instead, it wrought for France – and much of Europe – Jacobin terror, right-wing counter-terror, decades of war, and eventually Napoleonic tyranny.
A similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East, where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals.
Historically speaking, what is now happening is without precedent in the Arab world.
For the first time, Arab authoritarian regimes have been toppled, and others are threatened, by mass demonstrations calling for freedom and democracy.
Previously, Arab regimes changed through military coups and other sorts of putsches, never through popular revolutions.
During the great democratic wave of the 1990’s, which brought down dictatorships in Eastern Europe, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, nothing similar happened in Arab North Africa and the Middle East.
Now, however, the region’s political inertia has been disrupted.
Cairo’s Tahrir Square has become a symbol for both hope and “people power.”
Yet, while most Arab regimes now appear threatened, only two authoritarian rulers – Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt – have been actually deposed so far. Theirs were relatively “soft” autocracies.
Much more oppressive and ruthless rulers – Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, Bashar Assad in Syria, and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen – though seriously threatened, have proven far more resilient (up to now) in suppressing popular opposition.
Even in tiny Bahrain, the Sunni minority has, for now, succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority, albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries.
As always, it is easier to bring down an autocracy than to construct and consolidate a democratic regime.
When communism in Eastern Europe collapsed, their old systems, despite some obvious differences, had the same characteristics: they were one-party dictatorships, with state control over the economy, education, and the media. Today, they are very different from each other.
Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary, for example, succeeded in navigating a successful transition to democracy and a functioning market economy.
Russia reverted to a neo-authoritarian system.
The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have all developed various “sultanistic” forms of government.
The reason for these differences is simple: democratic transition requires not only elections, but also several pre-conditions – a vibrant civil society; previous traditions, whether actual or remembered, of representation, pluralism, tolerance, and individualism; a limited role of religion; and an effective institutional framework for a multi-party system.
Where these conditions exist, a transition to democracy can succeed; where they are missing, the chances – as in Russia – for a successful transition to a consolidated democracy are slim.
Developments in Egypt will be crucial, not only because it is the largest Arab country, but also because some of the necessary pre-conditions appear to have a stronger presence there than elsewhere in the region.
Yet, even in Egypt, the challenges are enormous.
With early elections called for September, there is serious doubt as to whether opposition groups will have the time, means, and experience to organize effective political parties.
At the moment, only the army – which has effectively ruled the country since 1952 – and the Muslim Brotherhood, which has the widest social networks, appear to be serious players.
Will the army, whose monopoly of power is paradoxically legitimized by the massive demonstrations that toppled Mubarak, be willing to give up the enormous political and economic clout that it has amassed over decades?
One hears about a possible modus vivendi between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood.
Indeed, some activists are already back in Tahrir Square demonstrating against such an incongruous yet possible alliance.
In Libya, if Qaddafi falls, can such a highly tribalized country possess the building blocks needed for a functioning democracy?
The issue, one should emphasize, is not Islam as such: in Europe, the Catholic Church was for a long time the greatest enemy of democracy and liberalism.
Yet Christian Democratic parties today are one of the pillars of European democracy.
Like Christian churches, Islam can also change, and Indonesia and Turkey could well be examples for such a possibility.
But a context in which a fundamentalist Islamic group like the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest organization in society, with very little effective countervailing powers, creates a serious challenge.
How will all of this influence the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which appears stuck?
It may be difficult to know, especially as the fundamentalist Hamas, now in control of Gaza, might be encouraged by the rising power of its parent organization in Egypt.
The recent escalation of violence along Gaza’s border with Israel does suggest that events are developing in a dangerous direction.
As for Israel, it initially responded to the Arab revolts in a confused way.
Now its leaders maintain that they would welcome democratic changes in the region as a guarantor of peace and common values, though they express skepticism about whether such developments are actually imminent.
Skepticism is in order also with respect to the unknown consequences of Western military intervention in Libya: it may have been asked for by the Arab League and legitimized by the UN Security Council, yet the outcome is far from certain.
Whatever happens in Libya will have repercussions across the region.
The road to democracy has always been rocky – look at a century of upheavals in Europe and the difficulties the US faced when dealing with slavery and the rights of its black population.
It is to be hoped that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel in the Arab Middle East as well, but the tunnel may be a long one.

McCain, Obama, and Hot Air
WASHINGTON, DC – Whatever the outcome of the United States’ presidential election, climate change policy will be transformed.
Both candidates have placed great importance on global warming.
Republican John McCain believes that it presents “a test of foresight, of political courage, and of the unselfish concern that one generation owes to the next,” while Democrat Barack Obama calls it “one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation.”
It remains far from clear, however, whether the shift in rhetoric and policy will move the planet any closer to embracing the best response.
Both McCain and Obama could leave future generations lumbered with the costs of major cuts in carbon emissions – without major cuts in temperatures.
Both politicians are keen to tap into voters’ concerns about global warming.
McCain launched a television commercial declaring that he had “stood up to President George Bush” on global warming.
If elected, Obama plans to count on former vice president and passionate campaigner Al Gore to help “lead the fight” against warming.
Each would introduce aggressive targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Obama’s plan would reduce emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050, while McCain aims to ensure that emissions are 60% lower by then.
Both would achieve these ambitious cuts by the same method: a cap-and-trade system that imposes limits on industry emissions and forces businesses to buy rights to any additional emissions.
A cap-and-trade system can seem like a neat market solution.
In fact, it is worse than a straightforward carbon tax.
With a tax, the costs are obvious.
With a cap-and-trade system, the costs – in terms of jobs, household consumption, and economic growth – are hidden, shifted around, and not easy to estimate, though models indicate they will run into trillions of dollars.
Not everybody would lose.
Some big businesses in privileged positions would make a fortune from exploiting this rather rigged market.
And politicians would have an opportunity to control the number and distribution of emission permits and the flow of billions of dollars in subsidies and sweeteners.
This is a very expensive, unwieldy way to achieve a very small reduction in temperatures.
The Warner-Lieberman bill on climate change – a piece of legislation which was recently abandoned in the US Senate but is seen as a precursor of future policy – would have postponed the temperature increase in 2050 by about two years.
Recently, the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered eight of the world’s top economists – including five Nobel laureates – to examine research on the best ways to tackle 10 global challenges: air pollution, conflict, disease, global warming, hunger and malnutrition, lack of education, gender inequity, lack of water and sanitation, terrorism, and trade barriers.
Their goal was to create a prioritized list showing how money could best be spent combating these problems.
The panel concluded that the least-effective use of resources would come from simply cutting CO2 emissions.
A lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the group that shared last year’s Nobel Peace Prize with Gore – told the experts that spending $800 billion over 100 years solely on mitigating emissions would reduce inevitable temperature increases by just 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century.
Even accounting for the key environmental damage from warming, we would lose money, with avoided damages of just $685 billion for our $800 billion investment.
The expert panel concluded that investing in research and development into low-carbon energy would be a much sounder, more effective option – an effort that both McCain and Obama support.
But this, not carbon emissions, should be the core of their climate change policy.
Currently, low-carbon energy solutions are prohibitively expensive.
The typical cost of cutting a ton of CO2 is now about $20, but the damage from a ton of carbon in the atmosphere is about $2.
So we need to reduce by roughly ten-fold the cost of cutting emissions.
We can achieve this by spending dramatically more researching and developing low-carbon energy.
The US could provide leadership by committing to spending 0.05% of its GDP exploring non-carbon-emitting energy technologies – wind, wave, or solar power – or capturing CO2 emissions from power plants.
It would then have the moral authority to demand that other nations do the same. By focusing more on research and development, and less in carbon cuts, both candidates could embrace a solution that encourages the best of the American innovative spirit and leaves the best possible legacy to future generations: a high-income, low-carbon energy world.

The Sunni Arc of Instability
ABU DHABI – While international observers fixate on the Sunni-Shia rivalry’s role in shaping geopolitics in the Islamic world, deep fissures within the Sunni arc that stretches from the Maghreb-Sahel region of North Africa to the Afghanistan-Pakistan belt are increasingly apparent.
Moreover, it is Sunni communities that produce the transnational jihadists who have become a potent threat to secular, democratic states near and far.
What is driving this fragmentation and radicalization within the ranks of Sunni Islam, and how can it be managed?
The importance of addressing that question cannot be overstated.
The largest acts of international terror, including the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, DC, and the 2008 Mumbai attack, were carried out by brutal transnational Sunni organizations (Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba, respectively).
The Sunni militant group Boko Haram, known internationally for abducting 276 schoolgirls in April and forcing them to marry its members, has been wreaking havoc in Nigeria for years.
And the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State, whose dramatic rise has entailed untold horrors to Iraq and Syria, are seeking to establish a caliphate, by whatever means necessary.
The influence of these organizations is far-reaching.
Just last month, individuals inspired by these groups’ activities carried out two separate attacks, one in the Canadian parliament and another on police officers in New York.
Political and tribal sectarianism in the Sunni Middle East and North Africa is both a reflection and a driver of the region’s weakening political institutions, with a series of failed or failing states becoming hubs of transnational terrorism.
A lawless Libya, for example, is now exporting jihad and guns across the Sahel and undermining the security of fellow Maghreb countries and Egypt.
Several largely Sunni countries – including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan – have become de facto partitioned, with little prospect of reunification in the near future.
Jordan and Lebanon could be the next states to succumb to Sunni extremist violence.
The Sunni tumult has underscored the fragility of almost all Arab countries, while diluting the centrality of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
The post-Ottoman order – created by the British, with some help from the French, after World War I – is disintegrating, with no viable alternative in sight.
The sectarianism plaguing the Sunni belt is affecting even the relatively stable oil sheikdoms of the Gulf, where a schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council is spurring new tensions and proxy competition among its members.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates view Qatar’s efforts to aid Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat, even as their own wealth has fueled the spread of Salafi jihadism and Al Qaeda ideology.
Both countries, along with Bahrain, have recalled their ambassadors from Qatar.
This rupture is compounded by a rift between the Middle East’s two main Sunni powers, Egypt and Turkey, whose relationship soured last year, after the Egyptian military ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government, backed by pro-Islamist Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Egypt recalled its ambassador from Ankara and expelled the Turkish ambassador from Cairo.
In September, the Egyptian foreign ministry accused Erdoğan of seeking to “provoke chaos” and “incite divisions in the Middle East region through his support for groups and terrorist organizations.”
A similar divide exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the latter’s provision of aid and sanctuary to Afghan militants – a divide that will only deepen when the United States-led NATO coalition ends its combat operations in Afghanistan this year.
Pakistan’s support has spawned two incarnations of the Taliban: the Afghan Taliban, sponsored by the Pakistani military, and the Pakistani Taliban, the Pakistani military’s nemesis.
Successive Afghan governments have refused to recognize the frontier with Pakistan known as the Durand line, a British-colonial invention that split the large ethnic Pashtun population.
Such conflicts are spurring the militarization of Sunni states.
The UAE and Qatar have already instituted compulsory military service for adult males.
And Kuwait is considering following in Jordan’s footsteps by reintroducing conscription, which is already in place in most Sunni states (and Iran).
Against this background, efforts to tame the deep-seated Sunni-Shia rivalry (by, for example, improving relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran), though undoubtedly important, should not take priority over a strategy to address the sectarianism plaguing the Sunni belt.
That strategy must center on federalism.
Had federalism been introduced in Somalia, for example, when the north-south rift emerged, it probably would not have ended up as a failed state.
Today, federalism can allow for the orderly management of key Sunni countries, where a unitary state simply is not practical.
The problem is that federalism has become a dirty word in most Sunni countries.
And the emergence of new threats has made some governments, most notably Saudi Arabia’s, staunchly opposed to change.
What these countries do not seem to recognize is that it is the petrodollar-funded export of Wahhabism – the source of modern Sunni jihad – that has gradually extinguished more liberal Islamic traditions elsewhere and fueled the international terrorism that now threatens to devour its sponsors.
Stagnation is not stability.
On the contrary, in the Sunni arc today, it means a vicious cycle of expanding extremism, rapid population growth, rising unemployment, worsening water shortages, and popular discontent.
Political fissures and tribal and ethnic sectarianism add fuel to this lethal mix of volatility and violence.
It is time for the Sunni world to recognize the need for a federalist approach to manage the instability and conflict that plagues it.
Even the US must reconsider its regional policy, which has long depended on alliances with despotic Sunni rulers.
In a region ravaged by conflict, business as usual is no longer an option.

Austerity and Debt Realism
CAMBRIDGE – Many, if not all, of the world’s most pressing macroeconomic problems relate to the massive overhang of all forms of debt.
In Europe, a toxic combination of public, bank, and external debt in the periphery threatens to unhinge the eurozone.
Across the Atlantic, a standoff between the Democrats, the Tea Party, and old-school Republicans has produced extraordinary uncertainty about how the United States will close its 8%-of-GDP government deficit over the long term.
Japan, meanwhile is running a 10%-of-GDP budget deficit, even as growing cohorts of new retirees turn from buying Japanese bonds to selling them.
Aside from wringing their hands, what should governments be doing?
One extreme is the simplistic Keynesian remedy that assumes that government deficits don’t matter when the economy is in deep recession; indeed, the bigger the better.
At the opposite extreme are the debt-ceiling absolutists who want governments to start balancing their budgets tomorrow (if not yesterday).
Both are dangerously facile.
The debt-ceiling absolutists grossly underestimate the massive adjustment costs of a self-imposed “sudden stop” in debt finance.
Such costs are precisely why impecunious countries such as Greece face massive social and economic displacement when financial markets lose confidence and capital flows suddenly dry up.
Of course, there is an appealing logic to saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us; unfortunately, it is not so simple.
Governments typically have myriad ongoing expenditure commitments related to basic services such as national defense, infrastructure projects, education, and health care, not to mention to retirees.
No government can just walk away from these responsibilities overnight.
When US President Ronald Reagan took office on January 20, 1981, he retroactively rescinded all civil-service job offers extended by the government during the two and a half months between his election and the inauguration.
The signal that he intended to slow down government spending was a powerful one, but the immediate effect on the budget was negligible.
Of course, a government can also close a budget gap by raising taxes, but any sudden shift can significantly magnify the distortions that taxes cause.
If the debt-ceiling absolutists are naïve, so, too, are simplistic Keynesians.
They see lingering post-financial-crisis unemployment as a compelling justification for much more aggressive fiscal expansion, even in countries already running massive deficits, such as the US and the United Kingdom.
People who disagree with them are said to favor “austerity” at a time when hyper-low interest rates mean that governments can borrow for almost nothing.
But who is being naïve?
It is quite right to argue that governments should aim only to balance their budgets over the business cycle, running surpluses during booms and deficits when economic activity is weak.
But it is wrong to think that massive accumulation of debt is a free lunch.
In a series of academic papers with Carmen Reinhart – including, most recently, joint work with Vincent Reinhart (“Debt Overhangs: Past and Present”) – we find that very high debt levels of 90% of GDP are a long-term secular drag on economic growth that often lasts for two decades or more.
The cumulative costs can be stunning.
The average high-debt episodes since 1800 last 23 years and are associated with a growth rate more than one percentage point below the rate typical for periods of lower debt levels.
That is, after a quarter-century of high debt, income can be 25% lower than it would have been at normal growth rates.
Of course, there is two-way feedback between debt and growth, but normal recessions last only a year and cannot explain a two-decade period of malaise.
The drag on growth is more likely to come from the eventual need for the government to raise taxes, as well as from lower investment spending.
So, yes, government spending provides a short-term boost, but there is a trade-off with long-run secular decline.
It is sobering to note that almost half of high-debt episodes since 1800 are associated with low or normal real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates.
Japan’s slow growth and low interest rates over the past two decades are emblematic.
Moreover, carrying a huge debt burden runs the risk that global interest rates will rise in the future, even absent a Greek-style meltdown.
This is particularly the case today, when, after sustained massive “quantitative easing” by major central banks, many governments have exceptionally short maturity structures for their debt.
Thus, they run the risk that a spike in interest rates would feed back relatively quickly into higher borrowing costs.
With many of today’s advanced economies near or approaching the 90%-of-GDP level that loosely marks high-debt periods, expanding today’s already large deficits is a risky proposition, not the cost-free strategy that simplistic Keynesians advocate.
I will focus in the coming months on the related problems of high private debt and external debts, and I will also return to the theme of why this is a time when elevated inflation is not so naïve.
Above all, voters and politicians must beware of seductively simple approaches to today’s debt problems.

Risking It All
CAMBRIDGE – Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the developed world fret about myriad minor – or sometimes improbable – hazards: carcinogens in food, air crashes, and so forth. But we are less secure than we think.
We are in denial about scenarios that could cause such devastation that even one occurrence would be too many.
Much has been written about possible ecological shocks triggered by the impact of a growing human population’s demands on the biosphere, and about the social and political tensions stemming from resource scarcity or climate change.
Even more worrying are the downside risks of powerful new cyber, bio, and nanotechnologies: A few individuals, via error or terror, could ignite a societal breakdown so quickly that government responses would be overwhelmed.
The “Anthropocene” era, in which the main global threats come from humans rather than from nature, became especially risky with the mass deployment of thermonuclear weapons.
Throughout the Cold War, false alarms and miscalculation by both superpowers were a constant occurrence, with several posing a serious risk of triggering nuclear Armageddon.
Those who anxiously lived through the Cuban missile crisis would have been gripped by panic had they realized just how close the world came to catastrophe.
Only later did we learn that President John F. Kennedy at one stage assessed the odds of nuclear war as “somewhere between one in three and even.”
And only when he was long retired did Kennedy’s defense secretary, Robert McNamara, state frankly that “[w]e came within a hairbreadth of nuclear war without realizing it.
It’s no credit to us that we escaped – Khrushchev and Kennedy were lucky as well as wise.”
It is now conventional wisdom that nuclear deterrence worked; and, in a sense, it did.
But that does not mean that it was a wise policy.
If you play Russian roulette with one or two bullets in the barrel, you are more likely to survive than not, but the stakes would need to be astonishingly high – or the value you place on your life inordinately low – for this to seem a wise gamble.
But we were dragooned into just such a gamble throughout the Cold War.
It would be interesting to know what level of risk other leaders thought they were exposing us to, and what odds most citizens would have accepted, had they been asked to give their informed consent.
For my part, I would not have chosen to accept a one in three – or even a one in six – chance of a disaster that would have killed hundreds of millions and shattered our cities, even if the alternative were a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
And, of course, the devastating consequences of thermonuclear war would have spread far beyond the countries that faced a direct threat.
Fortunately, the threat of global annihilation involving tens of thousands of H-bombs is in abeyance, though there is now more reason to worry that smaller nuclear arsenals might be used in a regional context, or by terrorists.
But when we recall the geopolitical convulsions of the last century – two world wars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and so forth – we cannot rule out a global realignment that leads to a future standoff between new superpowers.
A new generation could face its own version of the Cuban missile crisis – one that might be handled with less skill – or less luck – than the original was.
Nuclear weapons are the darkest side of twentieth-century science.
But there are novel concerns stemming from the impact of fast-developing twenty-first-century technologies.
Our interconnected world depends on elaborate networks: power grids, air traffic control, international finance, just-in-time delivery, and so forth. Unless these networks are highly resilient, their manifest benefits could be outweighed by catastrophic (albeit rare) breakdowns.
Moreover, a contagion of social and economic breakdown would spread worldwide via computer networks and “digital wildfire” literally at the speed of light.
Concern about cyber-attacks, by criminals or hostile countries, is rising sharply.
Likewise, while it is hard to make a clandestine H-bomb, millions will one day have the capability and resources to misuse biotechnology, just as they can misuse cybertechnology today.
The physicist Freeman Dyson foresees a time when children will be able to design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets.
Were this to happen, our ecology (and even our species) surely would not survive unscathed.
And, as for cybertechnology, should we worry about another science fiction scenario – that a network of computers could develop a mind of its own and threaten us all?
Some would dismiss such concerns as a jeremiad; after all, human societies have survived for millennia, despite storms, earthquakes, and pestilence.
But these human-induced threats are different: They are new, so we have had limited exposure to them and cannot be so sanguine that, if disaster struck, we would survive for long – or that governments could cope.
It follows that we have no grounds for confidence that we could survive the worst that even more powerful future technologies could inflict on us.
In a media landscape saturated with sensational science stories, end-times Hollywood productions, and Mayan warnings of apocalypse, it may be hard to persuade the public that potential catastrophes could arise as unexpectedly as the 2008 financial crisis did – and with a far greater impact.
Existential risks receive disproportionately little serious attention.
Some suggested scenarios can be dismissed, but we should surely try to assess which ones cannot – and study how to mitigate them.

Donald Trump and the New Economic Order
HONG KONG – Since the end of World War II, the hierarchy of economic priorities has been relatively clear.
At the top was creating an open, innovative, and dynamic market-driven global economy, in which all countries can (in principal) thrive and grow.
Coming in second – one might even say a distant second – was generating vigorous, sustainable, and inclusive national growth patterns.
No more.
In fact, a reversal seems to be underway.
Achieving strong inclusive national-level growth to revive a declining middle class, kick-start stagnant incomes, and curtail high youth unemployment is now taking precedence.
Mutually beneficial international arrangements governing flows of goods, capital, technology, and people (the four key flows in the global economy) are appropriate only when they reinforce – or, at least, don’t undermine – progress on meeting the highest priority.
This reversal became apparent in June, when Britons – including those who benefit significantly from the existing open economic and financial system – voted to leave the European Union, based on what might be called the sovereignty principle.
EU institutions were perceived to be undermining Britain’s capacity to boost its own economy, regulate immigration, and control its destiny.
A similar view has been animating nationalist and populist political movements across Europe, many of which believe that supra-national arrangements should come second to domestic prosperity.
The EU – which actually does, in its current configuration, leave its member governments short of policy tools to meet their citizens’ evolving needs – is an easy target.
But even without such institutional arrangements, there is a sense that emphasizing international markets and linkages can hamper a country’s capacity to advance its own interests.
Donald Trump’s victory in the United States’ presidential election made that abundantly clear.
In keeping with Trump’s main campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” it was his “America first” comments that were most revealing.
While Trump might pursue mutually beneficial bilateral agreements, one can expect that they will be subordinated to domestic priorities, especially distributional aims, and supported only insofar as they are consistent with these priorities.
Developed-country voters’ frustration with the old market-driven global economic architecture is not unfounded.
That order did allow powerful forces, at times beyond the control of elected officials and policymakers, to shape national economies.
It may be true that some of that order’s elites chose to ignore the adverse distributional and employment-related consequences of the old order, while reaping the benefits.
But it is also true that the old order, taken as sacrosanct, hampered elites’ capacity to address such problems, even if they tried.
This was not always the case.
In the wake of WWII, the US, motivated partly by the Cold War, helped to create the old order by facilitating economic recovery in the West and, over time, creating growth opportunities for developing countries.
For 30 years or so, the distributional aspects of the global growth patterns that these efforts underpinned were positive, both for individual countries and for the world as a whole.
Compared with anything that came before, the post-war order was a boon for inclusiveness.
But nothing lasts forever.
As inequality across countries has declined, inequality within countries has surged – to the point that the reversal of priorities was probably inevitable.
Now that the reversal has arrived, so have the consequences.
While it is difficult to say precisely what those will be, some seem fairly clear.
For starters, the US will be more reluctant to absorb a disproportionate share of the cost of providing global public goods.
While other countries will eventually pick up the slack, there will be a transition period of unknown duration, during which the supply of such goods may decline, potentially undermining stability.
For example, the terms of engagement in NATO are likely to be renegotiated.
Multilateralism – long enabled by the same sort of asymmetric contribution, though typically proportionate to countries’ income and wealth – will also lose steam, as the trend toward bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements accelerates.
Trump is likely to be a leading proponent of this tack; in fact, even regional trade deals may be ruled out, as his opposition to ratifying the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership suggests.
This creates an opportunity for China to lead the establishment of a trade pact for Asia – an opportunity that Chinese leaders are already set to seize.
In conjunction with its “one belt, one road” strategy and its creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China’s influence in the region will expand significantly as a result.
Meanwhile, for developing countries that lack China’s economic might, the trend away from multilateralism could hurt.
Whereas poor and less-developed countries found opportunities to grow and prosper under the old order, they will struggle to negotiate effectively on a bilateral basis.
The hope is that the world will recognize its collective interest in keeping development pathways open for poorer countries, both for these countries’ benefit and for the sake of international peace and security.
Beyond trade, technology is another powerful global force that is likely to be treated differently in the new order, becoming subject to more national-level regulations.
Cyber threats will all but require some regulations and will demand evolving policy interventions.
But other threats – for example, the fake news that has proliferated in the West (and, in particular, in the US during the presidential campaign) – may also call for a more hands-on approach.
And the adoption of work-displacing digital technologies may need to be paced, so that the economy’s structural adjustment can keep up.
The new emphasis on national interests clearly has costs and risks. But it may also bring important benefits.
A global economic order sitting atop a crumbling foundation – in terms of democratic support and national political and social cohesion – is not stable.
As long as people’s identities are mainly organized, as they are now, around citizenship in nation-states, a country-first approach may be the most effective.
Like it or not, we are about to find out.

China’s Plenum Test
TOKYO – There is something odd and disturbing about the conventional wisdom surrounding the upcoming Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
As the November 9-12 conclave draws near, the international community’s attention seems to be focused mainly on technocratic policy changes deemed essential to restructuring China’s state-dominated economy and reenergizing growth.
Will the government liberalize interest rates or loosen capital controls?
How will the fiscal system be revamped?
Will land reform be part of the package?
The list of such questions goes on.
Outside China, the prevalent view among business leaders is that President Xi Jinping’s new administration has consolidated its power and acquired enough authority to push through far-reaching economic reforms.
He and his colleagues need only to get the specific policies right.
On the surface, such thinking may seem reasonable.
In China’s top-down political system, a unified leadership is seen as fully capable of forcing the bureaucracy to comply with its wishes.
With Xi’s anti-corruption campaign in full swing, and the example of Bo Xilai’s imprisonment serving as a warning to the new president’s adversaries (no matter how senior they are), Chinese officials at all levels, it is widely believed, are likely to toe the line.
Unfortunately, this view is both too sanguine and naïve.
It overestimates the effectiveness of anti-corruption campaigns in contemporary China (there have been many in the last three decades), and it overlooks the political sources of the country’s economic slowdown. While Xi’s efforts to cleanse the rot inside the Chinese party-state should be applauded, it is no less important to recognize their limits.
So far, Xi’s campaign has remained a conventional affair involving selective prosecution.
Given the central government’s well-known inability to enforce its policies at the local level and the prevalence of tight-knit patronage networks in Chinese provinces and cities, it is unrealistic to expect that the current anti-corruption drive will produce significantly better results than in the past.
Indeed, the fight against corruption is at war with itself, because Xi is simultaneously seeking to buttress one-party rule.
But it is precisely the absence of effective checks on the exercise of power that encourages and sustains rampant corruption in the first place.
Optimism about the CCP’s ability to push through market-oriented reforms also ignores the real obstacles to future growth and prosperity, which do not include a lack of economic ideas or policy expertise; on the contrary, it is well known – even obvious – what kind of economic reforms are needed.
What prevents China from pursuing these reforms is a combination of opposition from powerful entrenched interest groups – state-owned enterprises, local governments, the economic-policy bureaucracy, and family members of political elites and well-connected businessmen – and flawed political institutions.
Unless Xi and his colleagues demonstrate their resolve to overcome such opposition and launch comprehensive reforms, their chances of success are not high.
Opponents of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms were ideologically driven; they had no personal stake in the Maoist political economy. Defeating them required building a winning coalition within the party, discrediting the communist ideology, and rallying public support, all of which Deng did.
Today, by contrast, members of the ruling elite benefit directly and immensely from the state-dominated economy.
Market-oriented reform, by leveling the competitive playing field, would hurt their interests and reduce their privileges, making fierce opposition likely.
Only by mobilizing pressure outside the party-state can these insiders be forced to accept some of the decentralizing and liberalizing reforms that China’s economy needs.
At that point, China will have a better chance of improving its legal institutions, increasing political accountability, strengthening protection of private property rights, and making the government genuinely – in Mao’s words – “serve the people.”
Without real and significant political change, technocratic reform proposals will treat only the symptoms of China’s economic malaise, without addressing its underlying institutional causes.
In assessing the outcome of the Third Plenum, what observers should really be looking for is evidence of a bold strategy for political reform.
If Xi and his colleagues produce no credible sign of such a commitment, everything else will be eyewash – and skepticism about China’s fate under their leadership eventually will be vindicated.

Macron’s Great Gamble
TOULOUSE – In reaction to the ongoing “Yellow Vest” revolt in France, President Emmanuel Macron has decided to hold a “grand” nationwide debate.
Over the coming months, locally organized workshops, Internet-based consultations, and regional citizen conferences will assess the French public’s views on four issues: environmental policy, democracy and identity, taxes, and the organization of the state.
But Macron’s plan faces three obstacles.
For starters, French public opinion is rife with contradictions.
The yellow vests, for example, want both lower taxes and more public services.
Neither demand is unreasonable.
But nor is such a fiscal approach sustainable in a country where public expenditure amounts to 57% of GDP and the debt ratio, already officially estimated at close to 100%, does not include large off-balance-sheet public liabilities like unfunded pensions.
Complicating matters further, there is broad support in France both for the yellow vests, whose rebellion started with a demand to repeal the carbon tax levied on fuel consumption, and for an initiative to sue the French government for failing to address climate change.
Moreover, when the yellow vests complain about inequality, they tend to focus on Macron’s elimination of the wealth tax, which previously brought in €5 billion ($5.7 billion) per year – a pittance compared to the €188 billion ($214 billion) generated annually by the value-added tax (VAT).
Or they complain about the salaries of top government officials.
But they offer no concrete proposals that address two key factors driving inequality in France: education and labor-market access.
According to the Programme for International Student Assessment, the educational-performance gap between students from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest of the population is higher in France than in any other OECD country.
And not only does France’s unemployment rate rest at around 10%; its two-tier labor market funnels over 90% of new hires – particularly younger, low-skill workers – into short fixed-term contracts.
In addition to contradictory demands, Macron will also have to confront obstacles rooted in public perception.
The way French citizens view economic conditions rarely accords with reality.
One often hears that France is a particularly inegalitarian country, where the rich don’t pay taxes, where retirees are always gouged, or where tax evasion and politicians’ salaries consume vast resources.
None of these claims stand up to scrutiny.
To be sure, Macron’s government was too slow in designing compensatory measures to offset the combined impact of increased oil prices, the programmed increase in the carbon tax, and the repeal of subsidies for diesel vehicles.
But the French are also blaming him for the effects of unreasonable policies going back decades, including the diesel subsidies (maintained for 20-plus years to support the French car industry) and measures promoting high inner-city land rents.
The third obstacle to progress is violence.
In recent weeks, there has been a striking increase in threats from yellow vests against legislators, journalists, and even fellow protestors who have expressed a willingness to negotiate with the government.
Macron’s government thus finds itself between a rock and a hard place.
And yet, a public consultation could well create even more havoc.
Centuries of political history stand as a warning against the current enthusiasm for instituting a “referendum d’initiative citoyenne.”
After all, most democracies have opted for representative government, rather than rule by referendum, for good reason.
In theory, at least, the people’s representatives can devote more time to thinking about the tradeoffs of different policy choices, and have more access than average citizens to expertise.
And, unlike citizens debating in cafés or on Facebook and Twitter, elected representatives’ arguments are publicly scrutinized and fact-checked.
Moreover, there is good reason to delegate certain forms of public decision-making to independent judges, central banks, and regulatory authorities.
Insofar as they are insulated from political lobbying and elections, these actors can take a longer-term view and protect the rights of minorities.
By circumventing these checks, referenda in France could open the door to the revocation of laws permitting abortion, banning capital punishment, and recognizing gay marriage.
It also could lead to all manner of demagogic economic policies – from a lower retirement age to anti-immigrant measures or even a “Frexit” from the eurozone or the European Union.
On the other hand, if Macron’s government merely pays lip service to civic consultation, the malaise will deepen; the yellow vests will have received “confirmation” that elites do not listen when citizens express what they need.
So, what good could come of the consultation?
A successful debate would re-engage the French in their country’s political life.
In France, decision-making is highly centralized, policies are uniform (despite some timid attempts by Macron’s government to promote flexibility), and civic participation is weak.
The elite’s reluctance to trust citizens, combined with citizens’ own lack of engagement and occasional puerility, creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that the feeling of “existing” – of participating in an adventure and having one’s voice heard in the media – has become a palpable feature of the yellow-vest experience.
The problem is that French citizens’ previous disengagement and poor understanding of economic realities predisposes them to make categorical demands, rather than pushing for realistic reforms.
A properly structured consultation in which French citizens ponder tradeoffs, acknowledge objective facts, and rediscover a sense of community could be a tremendous success.
For example, once everyone accepts that there is a tension between reducing taxes and improving public services, a debate can be held on how best to achieve an optimal policy mix.
Everything should be on the table.
The French must consider the purpose of each and every public service; whether those services are fulfilling their objectives, and at a reasonable cost; and whether there are better alternatives on offer.
This is what the Canadians and the Scandinavians did in the 1990s, when they, too, were facing dysfunctional public sectors, rising public debts, and high unemployment.
France is finally engaging in a process to modernize the economy while still protecting its citizens.
But the country is at a crossroads, and its citizens could still drag their country down the path of illiberalism and demagogy.

An Economic Ultimatum for the Arab World
WASHINGTON, DC – If Middle Eastern countries do not start making real progress on fundamental political and economic reforms, further regional turmoil is inevitable.
With the rentier systems that governments have maintained for decades now at a breaking point, policymakers must begin the difficult, but not impossible, process of establishing new social contracts.
That contract in Arab countries started to erode at the turn of the century, when governments with inflated budgets and bloated bureaucracies could no longer provide an adequate supply of basic services such as health care and education, create a sufficient number of jobs, or sustain food and fuel subsidies.
But, despite diminished state benefits, most leaders have continued to insist that their countries’ people uphold their end of the contract by not participating meaningfully in public life.
Arab governments were able to sustain inefficient economies for decades because they were propped up by oil revenues.
In recent decades, most Arab countries have benefited in some way from the Middle East’s abundant oil and gas reserves.
Hydrocarbon-producing countries used their profits to buy their citizens’ loyalty and establish what were effectively welfare states; and non-oil producers enjoyed the benefits of aid, capital inflows, and remittances sent back by their nationals working in resource-rich countries.
Because the governments of oil-producing countries used revenues to provide for most of their people’s needs – including jobs, services, and favors – these governments fostered a culture of dependency, rather than encouraging self-reliance and entrepreneurship to expand the private sector.
What’s more, because they did not need to tax their citizens to generate revenues, people had little recourse to challenge authoritarianism.
The political culture reflected a simple principle: “no taxation, no representation.”
Now that oil prices are declining and will likely continue to remain low for several years, if not permanently, the Middle East’s rentier systems face a significant challenge.
Saudi Arabia, for example, is raising taxes, cutting domestic subsidies, and shifting its foreign-aid paradigm away from grants and toward investments.
The kingdom has long provided financial support to Egypt, Jordan, and other countries in the region, so this shift will put pressure on those governments to pursue private-sector growth to improve their own countries’ economic performance.
But, while the Arab world’s governments have reached the limits of their ability to employ more people, raise public debt, and attract outside grants, members of these countries’ political and economic elite, whom the current rentier system privileges, will likely resist efforts at substantive reform.
And we should expect to see further opposition from state bureaucracies, which lack any vision for a transition to an inclusive and sustainable economic model.
Still, Middle Eastern countries cannot hope to develop prosperous economies without such a transition.
After relying on resource rents for decades, these governments must switch not only to new growth models, but also to more representative governance.
When Arab societies are asked to accept reduced subsidies, fewer government jobs, and less from the state in general, they will demand a larger share in the decision-making process.
As it stands, the Arab world is stuck between an unsustainable economic and political status quo and the inclusive, merit-based economic system that less myopic people in the region know must replace it.
Too many Arab governments have put themselves in this untenable situation, having given little consideration to building the governance institutions their states need.
The first wave of Arab uprisings, which began in December 2010 and led to the 2011 Arab Spring, was a response to the breakdown of the old social contracts.
In today’s perfect storm of declining oil prices and closed political systems, a new wave of protest could well emerge, particularly where governments have not recognized that the end of rentierism marks the end of the old social contract.
For these governments, economic reform is now a matter of survival.
In a more open system, Arab governments will need to privatize many state-controlled companies, and make it far easier for entrepreneurs to register start-ups and launch new businesses.
And, ultimately, Arab states’ economic reforms will succeed only if citizens gain a more powerful voice in governance.
Tunisia is the one country where a new social contract has begun to replace rentierism.
The rest of the Arab world faces two alternatives. Its leaders can begin fighting the cancer of an unsustainable status quo, with all the pain and uncertainty that such a struggle entails; or they can wait for the cancer to become a terminal condition, and be devoured by it.

Why Europe's Roma Matter
The World Bank, the Open Society Institute, and the European Commission are co-sponsoring a conference, Roma in an Expanding Europe: Challenges for the Future, from June 30-July 1 in Budapest, with the Government of Hungary as host.
Here, the President of the World Bank and the Chairman of the OSI discuss the problems that must be addressed.
Too often in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Roma teens and children spend their days at the garbage dump.
Unable to afford school, they scavenge for paper and other scraps for recycling, earning just enough to eat.
Too often Roma families live in tiny cramped wooden or tin shacks with no power or running water and dim prospects for the future.
A similar picture, though on a smaller scale, exists in many European Union member countries that are home to Roma minorities.
A wide socioeconomic disparity exists between Europe's majority population and Roma, or "Gypsies", many of whom live in extreme poverty.
Left unchanged, this persistent poverty threatens to become a permanent drag on European prosperity, which would be a tragedy for Roma and non-Roma alike.
The situation of the 7-9 million Roma living on the continent deserves the urgent attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of an enlarged EU.
Roma are the continent's fastest growing and most vulnerable minority.
Boosting their prospects will be crucial to sustained prosperity on the continent, and will require implementing inclusive policies to ensure that Roma enjoy the post-transition benefits of open, free-market economies.
Indeed, Roma have been among the biggest losers in the transition from communism since 1989.
They were often the first to lose their jobs in the early 1990's, and they have been persistently blocked from reentering the labor force due to their often inadequate skills and pervasive discrimination.
Even in the more prosperous countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Roma poverty is strikingly high--sometimes more than ten times that of non-Roma.
While accession countries such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have made impressive progress in economic and political transformation during the 1990's, dealing with the plight of the Roma remains one of the most critical issues on their path to EU membership next year and over the next decade.
In 2000, nearly 80% of Roma in Bulgaria and Romania were living on less than $4.30 per day, in comparison with 37% of the total population of Bulgaria and 30% in Romania.
In better-off Hungary, 40% of Roma were living on incomes below this level, compared with 7% of the non-Roma population.
Poverty, combined with higher birth rates, means that the magnitude of Roma hardship will grow in coming years.
Roughly 25-30% of Roma are under 15 years of age, in contrast with 10% of the majority population.
High unemployment, particularly among young people, locks Roma in a vicious cycle of impoverishment and exclusion, further driving down living standards and leaving many in marginalized settlements without access to electricity, clean water, or other basic utilities.
Lack of education keeps Roma out of work and limits their future opportunities.
An estimated 600,000 Roma children of primary school age living in the EU accession countries are not attending school at all.
Of those that go, most do not complete primary school, and less than 1% across Central and Eastern Europe go on to higher education.
Many students who are in class are stuck in inferior segregated schools.
Others are wrongly placed in schools for the mentally and physically disabled, merely because they had no access to preschool, or because they do not speak the majority language.
Nonetheless, there is reason for optimism.
Over the past decade, a range of initiatives have been launched to keep Roma children in school, expand access to jobs, and overcome discrimination.
While such interventions by governments, non-government groups and international agencies have helped, the time has now come to scale up the effort.
Most importantly, a small but growing core of experienced and dedicated young Roma leaders is emerging who can work both within their communities and with governments to overcome poverty and discrimination.
At the end of this month, many of these young people will join us in Budapest, along with Prime Ministers and other senior officials from Central and Eastern European countries and EU member states.
For the first time, government and Roma leaders will tackle the Roma issue as a core social and economic concern.
Such an integrated policy approach is needed to ensure that the basic rights of Roma are truly realized in an expanded Europe.
We cannot afford to leave the Roma behind.

The Opportunity in Seoul
SEOUL – Hubris usually gives birth to disaster.
The root cause of the current global crisis was intellectual hubris in the form of the blind belief that markets would always resolve their own problems and contradictions.
Thirty years after the Reagan-Thatcher revolution, the ideological pendulum has begun to swing in the opposite direction.
Each time in the last hundred years that a shift of this magnitude has occurred in beliefs about state-market relations, a major political-economic upheaval has ensued. For example, World War I marked the end of the nineteenth-century’s laissez-faire liberalism and ushered in a period of state-centered economic systems.
The Great Depression and World War II opened the new era of the Bretton Woods system of a more balanced state-market relationship.
Similarly, the 2008 global financial crisis ended three decades of neo-liberalism, characterized by free trade and financial globalization.
We still do not know the nature of the era ahead of us; we can only be certain that the global economy is in the middle of a major transition, and that the old ways will not work anymore.
The main concern in this period of great uncertainty is whether the transition to a new paradigm can be managed without further destabilizing the international political-economic order.
There are already some serious signs of distress – the currency war between the United States and China, and its spread to other countries, being a case in point.
Indeed, current global conditions have more worrying similarities to the early 1930’s than they have differences.
Then, every state looked inward, squandering valuable opportunities to achieve common prosperity through international policy coordination.
The leadership vacuum caused by America’s unwillingness to cooperate and Britain’s sudden inability to lead resulted in the failure of the London Conference of 1933, which is often seen as opening the way to the Great Depression and the catastrophe of World War II.
Having learned the lessons of the 1930’s, the post-war global economic order was built on a network of international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and what ultimately became the World Trade Organization.
But the lessons of the past seem to be too distant in policymakers’ minds these days, whereas domestic political pressure to put national economies first appears overwhelming.
In addition, the institutions created in the days following WWII no longer seem effective enough to meet the new challenges of the global economy, and thus have lost some of their legitimacy.
For example, the IMF’s authority has suffered in the recent decade – especially in Asia – from the fund’s deep commitment to neo-liberal orthodoxy and the so-called “Washington Consensus.”
Reinvigorating these institutions is the first step toward solving the global economy’s current problems.
We need their help to implement norms, principles, rules, and decision-making procedures, thereby mitigating the endemic free-rider problems in quasi-anarchical international society.
Thus, the first task for the G-20 meeting on November 11-12 in Seoul must be to revitalize and strengthen the IMF and global financial regulation.
If the G-20 leaders can also make meaningful progress towards resolving the Doha Round of trade negotiations, they will add momentum for global economic stabilization.
There are signs that the Seoul meeting may be successful.
The meeting of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in the South Korean city of Kyeongju on October 22 produced some noteworthy achievements, such as shifting 6% of the IMF’s voting quota from overrepresented Europe to underrepresented emerging countries, doubling members’ quotas, and reducing Europe’s representation on the Fund’s executive board by two seats.
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn declared the move “historic” and the most important decision on the Fund’s governance since its establishment in 1944.
The IMF also was empowered to conduct the Mutual Assessment Process of each country’s macroeconomic policies under the Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth.
That authority should allow the Fund to inspect even the world’s mightiest economies, the US and China.
The recent agreement by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on a new capital-adequacy framework is another positive step.
But the key issues lingering in the minds of the G-20 leaders will be exchange rates and global imbalances.
The Kyeongju meeting decided that the G-20 countries would move toward market-determined exchange rates and pursue “politics conducive to reducing excessive imbalances and maintaining current-account imbalances at sustainable levels.”
These two issues may or may not be on the table for further discussion in Seoul.
If G-20 leaders can reach specific and effective agreements on exchange rates and global imbalances without overshadowing other issues, the prospects for a soft-landing for the global economy will improve greatly.
If not, protectionism and trade wars will intensify, and we will come one step closer to reliving the nightmare of the 1930’s.
Either way, the Seoul G-20 summit will likely mark a watershed in the history of the post-war global political economy.

What Really Matters in the Sino-American Competition?
CAMBRIDGE – The United States and China are competing for dominance in technology.
America has long been at the forefront in developing the technologies (bio, nano, information) that are central to economic growth in the twenty-first century.
Moreover, US research universities dominate higher education globally.
In Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s annual Academic Ranking of World Universities, 16 of the top 20 institutions are in the US; none is in China.
But China is investing heavily in research and development, and it is already competing with the US in key fields, not least artificial intelligence (AI), where it aims to be the global leader by 2030.
Some experts believe that China is well placed to achieve that goal, owing to its enormous data resources, a lack of privacy restraints on how that data is used, and the fact that advances in machine learning will require trained engineers more than cutting-edge scientists.
Given the importance of machine learning as a general-purpose technology that affects many other domains, China’s gains in AI are of particular significance.
Moreover, Chinese technological progress is no longer based solely on imitation.
Former US President Donald Trump’s administration punished China for its cybertheft of intellectual property, coerced IP transfers, and unfair trade practices.
Insisting on reciprocity, the US argued that if China could ban Google and Facebook from its market for security reasons, the US can take similar steps against Chinese giants like Huawei and ZTE.
But China is still innovating.
After the 2008 global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession, Chinese leaders increasingly came to believe that America was in decline.
Abandoning Deng Xiaoping’s moderate policy of keeping a low profile and biding one’s time, China adopted a more assertive approach that included building (and militarizing) artificial islands in the South China Sea, economic coercion against Australia, and the abrogation of its guarantees with respect to Hong Kong.
In response, some people in the US began to talk about the need for a general “decoupling.”
But as important as it is to unwind technology supply chains that directly relate to national security, it is a mistake to think that the US can decouple its economy completely from China without incurring enormous costs.
That deep economic interdependence is what makes the US relationship with China different from its relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
With the Soviets, the US was playing a one-dimensional chess game in which the two sides were highly interdependent in the military sphere but not in economic or transnational relations.
With China, by contrast, the US is playing three-dimensional chess with vastly different distributions of power at the military, economic, and transnational levels.
If we ignore the power relations on the economic or transnational boards, not to mention the vertical interactions between the boards, we will suffer.
A good China strategy therefore must avoid military determinism and encompass all three dimensions of interdependence.
The rules governing economic relations will need to be revised.
Well before the pandemic, China’s hybrid state capitalism followed a mercantilist model that distorted the functioning of the World Trade Organization and contributed to the rise of disruptive populism in Western democracies.
Today, America’s allies are far more cognizant of the security and political risks entailed in China’s espionage, coerced technology transfers, strategic commercial interactions, and asymmetric agreements.
The result will be more decoupling of technology supply chains, particularly where national security is at stake.
Negotiating new trade rules can help prevent that decoupling from escalating.
Against this backdrop, middle powers could come together to create a trade agreement for information and communication technology that would be open to countries meeting basic democratic standards.
One size will not fit all.
In areas like nuclear non-proliferation, peacekeeping, public health, and climate change, the US can find common institutional ground with China.
But in other areas, it makes more sense to set our own democratic standards.
The door can remain open to China in the long run; but we should accept that the run could be very long indeed.
Notwithstanding China’s growing strength and influence, working with likeminded partners would improve the odds that liberal norms prevail in the trade and technology domains.
Establishing a stronger transatlantic consensus on global governance is important.
But only by cooperating with Japan, South Korea, and other Asian economies can the West shape global trade and investment rules and standards for technology, thereby ensuring a more level playing field for companies operating abroad.
Taken together, democratic countries’ economies will exceed China’s well into this century; but only if they pull together.
That diplomatic factor will be more important than the question of China’s technological development.
In assessing the future of the US-China power balance, technology matters, but alliances matter even more.
Finally, a successful US response to China’s technological challenge will depend upon improvements at home as much as on external actions. Increased support for research and development is important.
Complacency is always a danger, but so, too, is lack of confidence or an overreaction driven by exaggerated fears.
As former MIT Provost John Deutch contends, if the US attains its improvements in innovation potential, “China’s great leap forward will likely at best be a few steps toward closing the innovation leadership gap that the United States currently enjoys.”
Immigration also will play an important role in maintaining America’s technology lead.
In 2015, when I asked former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew why he did not think China would surpass the US, he pointed to America’s ability to draw upon the talents of the whole world – a possibility that is barred by China’s ethnic Han nationalism.
It is no accident that many Silicon Valley companies have Asian founders or CEOs.
With enough time and travel, technology inevitably spreads.
If the US lets its fears about tech leakage shut it off from such valuable human imports, it will surrender one of its biggest advantages.
An overly restrictive immigration policy could severely curtail technological innovation – a fact that must not get lost in the heated politics of strategic competition.

Bush Loses in the Supreme Court and America Wins
Two rulings of the United States Supreme Court this week rejected the sweeping wartime powers claimed by President Bush.
In the case of Yaser Hamdi, the court renounced the Administration's claim that military authorities could indefinitely hold a U.S. citizen as an "enemy combatant" without ever providing him with an opportunity to contest the basis for his detention before a neutral decision maker.
And in a case brought by fourteen foreign nationals, the court cast aside the government's argument that because the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay is nominally under Cuban sovereignty, American courts lack jurisdiction to entertain legal claims brought by persons who had no say in where the U.S. military chose to detain them.
Although nowhere mentioned in either case, the scandalous treatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the revelations that high-level government lawyers prepared confidential memoranda authorizing torture, likely played a part in the Justices' reasoning.
The Administration essentially said, "trust us to do what's right."
Clearly, the court thought that such trust had not been earned.
Another unspoken consideration may have been at work in the Guantanamo Bay case, which has garnered considerable international attention.
In recent years, a majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court have articulated a multilateralist view of American law that stands in marked contrast to the unilateralism of the Bush Administration.
For example, in a 2002 Virginia case, the high court ruled that the execution of the mentally retarded is forbidden by the American Constitution as "cruel and unusual punishment."
While most of the Court's analysis focused on domestic considerations, the Justices also invoked a legal brief filed by the European Union that described the overwhelming disapproval of the practice in the world community.
Likewise, in last year's ruling striking down a Texas prohibition on same-sex sodomy, the Court cited a 1967 Act of the English Parliament and a 1981 ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.
Significantly, the six Justices in the majority in the Virginia and Texas cases also constituted the majority in the Guantanamo Bay case: the four dissenters from Bush v. Gore plus Ronald Reagan's two relatively moderate appointees, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy.
These Justices regularly travel to colloquia on comparative constitutional law and see themselves as part of an international community of high court judges.
It cannot have escaped their notice that to uphold indefinite detention of foreign nationals without judicial process would have made them virtual pariahs on the conference circuit.
I do not mean to suggest that the Justices decided the Guantanamo Bay case as they did so that they would be toasted at their international cocktail parties.
I contend that their concern for world opinion-if that concern played the role I am suggesting it did-was for their country, not for themselves.
In less than four years, President Bush and his advisers have cast aside much of the longstanding bipartisan consensus under which the United States works through and with multilateral institutions like the United Nations.
Alarmed by this dramatic volte-face, the majority Justices in the Guantanamo Bay case may be trying to send assurances to the rest of the world that President Bush does not speak for all Americans, not even the ones who put him in office in the first place.
Of course, neoconservative critics of the high court will see in this explanation the confirmation of their worst fears.
Here are judges, they will say, who do not understand that they have no legitimate qualifications to act as agents of American foreign policy, a job committed by the Constitution to the President and (they may grudgingly admit) Congress.
Yet the high court has considered foreign policy implications before.
In the most celebrated American case of the twentieth century, Brown v. Board of Education, the Justices were probably influenced by a government brief explaining how racial segregation in the southern United States undermined American efforts to compete with the Soviet Union for the hearts and minds of people in developing countries.
By holding that American apartheid violated the constitutional command of "equal protection of the laws," the court struck a blow for justice at home and American strategic interests abroad.
To be sure, the Brown precedent is not entirely analogous, for there the Supreme Court gave weight to foreign policy considerations in just the way that the federal executive had urged.
In the Guantanamo Bay case, by contrast, the Bush Administration argued that a ruling for the detainees would undermine the war effort by diverting manpower and material from the battlefield to the courtroom.
But the majority opinion of Justice John Paul Stevens paid little heed to the Administration's parade of horribles.
A decorated World War II veteran, Justice Stevens may well have thought that he was at least as qualified as the civilians in the Bush Justice Department to forecast the impact of the court's ruling on military efficiency.
Or perhaps the Justices were simply reacting to the Administration's constant overreaching.
Yes, the existence of religious fanatics eager to kill large numbers of innocent American civilians warrants strong measures in response.
But the Supreme Court's rulings affirm the fundamental principle that even grave dangers do not warrant the sort of blanket deference to which the Bush Administration believes it is entitled whenever it utters the words "war" and "terrorism."

Anatomy of a Crash
Why did high_tech stock market values fall so far in the last year-and-a-half?
What does the crash of the NASDAQ (and of smaller IT exchanges around the world) tell us about the future of the "new economy"?
As we move away from those events, a clearer assessment is possible.
Conventional wisdom holds that the NASDAQ crash exposed the "new economy" as a conjuring trick of smoke and mirrors.
It incarnated the irrational exuberance that often breaks out as a boom peaks and did not deliver deeper permanent changes in the economy.
A more likely explanation, however, is that the NASDAQ crashed because it became clear that dominant market positions in high tech_based businesses were not sources of profits unless accompanied by substantial barriers to entry for new potential competitors--and that such barriers to entry were becoming remarkably hard to create.
Over a wide range of activities, the dominant effect of the "new economy" has been to make competition more effective, not to create new advantages based upon economies of scale.
The high-tech crash was thus the result of a realization by investors that the "new economy" was, in most sectors and for most firms, unlikely to lead to large quasi_rent type profits from established market positions, but rather to heightened competition and reduced margins.
The exuberance that pushed the NASDAQ so high in 1999 and early 2000 rested on the belief that a technological leap forward in data processing and data communications technologies had created a host of "winner_take_all" markets in which increasing returns to scale were the dominant feature.
An information good--a computer program, a piece of online entertainment, or a source of information--needs to be produced only once and can then be distributed to a potentially unlimited number of consumers at very little (if any) additional cost.
The larger the market, the larger the cost advantage.
Moreover, information goods produced at larger scale are also more valuable to consumers.
The version with the largest market share becomes the standard; it is the easiest to figure out how to use, the easiest to find support for, and the one that works best with other products (which are, of course, designed to work best with it).
In the section of the "new economy" dominated by producers' economies of scale and consumers' economies of scope, a firm that establishes a lead in market share gains a nearly overwhelming advantage.
Unless its competitors take extraordinary and extraordinarily costly steps--like those taken by Microsoft against Netscape, its rival in the Internet browser market, by pouring a fortune into creating its Internet Explorer and then distributing it for free--the first firm to establish a dominant market position will reap high profits as long as its sector of the industry lasts.
But increasing returns to scale and winner_take_all markets are not the only, or even the primary, consequence of the IT revolution.
It is at least as likely that innovations in computer and communications technologies are competition's friends because they eliminate the frictions that in the past gave nearly every producer a little bit of monopoly power.
In the past you could comparison_shop only by trudging from store to store.
Today you can use the World Wide Web to conduct instant searches that can reveal the prices and qualities of every single producer.
Firms must adjust instantaneously or perish in the process.
Thus the "new economy" makes most markets more, not less, contestable.
A competitive edge based on past reputation, brand loyalty, or advertising footprints will fade away.
As they do, profit margins will fall: competition will become swifter, stronger, more pervasive, and more nearly perfect.
Consumers will gain and shareholders will lose.
Those products that can be competitively supplied will be supplied at very low margins.
The future of technology is bright; the future of the profit margins of businesses--save for those few that truly are able to use economies of scale to create mammoth cost advantages--is dim.
Is it really possible to acquire significant economies of scale by writing a single suite of software that will cover the heterogeneous purchasing requirements of millions of businesses seeking to streamline their operations by using the Internet? Is it really possible to obtain significant economies of scale by using the Internet to distribute information about groceries?
The NASDAQ crash was the result of realization by marginal investors that the odds were heavily against this.
But the NASDAQ crash tells us next to nothing about the future of the underlying technologies, or about their true value.
Perhaps the best analogy is an old puzzle posed by the classical economists three centuries ago: why is there such a difference between the price of water and the price of diamonds?
Water is absolutely essential to sustain life, and thus immensely valuable to every consumer. Yet water is cheap.
Diamonds, by contrast, have been and remain expensive.
The gap in price does not tell us that diamonds are useful and valuable and water is not, but that it has so far proved easier to maintain market power and high margins in the diamond business than in the water business.
The analogy to the Internet, the "new economy," and the crash of the NASDAQ is straightforward.
Even Internet Explorer, which today has as dominant a position in the browser market as anyone could wish to have, is not (or is not yet) a source of profits, and will not be, barring the creation of some essential function that Internet Explorer can serve and competing browsers cannot.
Our modern computer and communications technologies simply make it too cheap and too easy to distribute a competing product.
So, what NASDAQ's crash tells us is that the new economy is more likely to be a source of downward pressure on profit margins than of large, durable quasi_rents.

A Test for Europe’s German Anchor
BERLIN – The outcome of Germany’s federal election holds a crucial lesson for the European Union: even the country that has been the EU’s bedrock of stability amid crisis is not immune to political fragmentation and polarization.
Although Chancellor Angela Merkel will almost certainly gain a fourth term, her new government is likely to be considerably weaker than the three that preceded it.
The Bundestag now counts six factions, compared to four in the previous electoral term.
Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union took 33% of the vote, its worst result since 1949, though still enough to give the CDU the most seats in parliament.
The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) – Germany’s second-largest political party, and a part of Merkel’s last governing coalition – also hit a post-war low, receiving just 20.5% of the vote.
Meanwhile, the populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) won 12.6%, making this anti-euro, pro-Russia, and staunchly xenophobic party the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in almost 60 years.
And the SPD has thrown in the towel, vowing to spend the coming electoral term in opposition.
In this context, Germany is likely to be ruled by a so-called Jamaica coalition, named for the colors of the parties – the CDU, the Greens, and the Free Democrats (FDP) – that would comprise it.
But such a coalition will be unruly, owing to the parties’ heterogeneous foreign-policy positions.
Similarly, the SPD-led opposition will be beset by deep divisions.
Indeed, it is unlikely to cooperate on any issue at all with its fellow opposition party, the AfD.
The SPD shares almost no values with the AfD, which has already declared that its main goal will be to hound the other parties with populist and nationalist bombast.
As a result, decades-old parliamentary norms of decorum and collegiality are in jeopardy.
Given the Bundestag’s central role in shaping Germany’s EU policy, this could weaken the capacity of Merkel’s government to provide the kind of leadership Europe now needs.
To be sure, there is some good news.
The victory of Merkel’s CDU, however weak, implies elements of continuity on which to build.
Merkel’s prompt decision to take responsibility for forming a viable coalition government means that her commitment to preserving the EU and her staunch defense of democracy and Western values will continue to guide German policymaking.
Moderation, stability, and international openness will remain Germany’s watchwords, no matter how much ugly rhetoric the AfD spews.
But, in terms of action on international challenges, Germany’s partners will have to be patient.
In particular, though Merkel is expected to cooperate closely with France’s pro-European president, Emmanuel Macron, to forge a new model of EU integration for the post-Brexit age, she is unlikely to do so right away.
The formation of a coalition alone – in particular, a conservative-liberal-green coalition – will likely take months.
Next month’s state election in Lower Saxony, where the AfD secured significant support, adds another element of uncertainty to the mix.
Even after that election, compromise may not come easily.
The Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) – the CDU’s sister party – will face a state election next autumn.
Feeling the hot breath of the AfD on its neck, the CSU has already sharpened its criticism of Merkel’s immigration policy, and is likely to try to push the chancellor further to the right in the coming year.
Perhaps the stickiest issue for the coalition parties will be the eurozone.
The stances of the FDP and the Greens are opposed on this front, particularly when it comes to joint crisis management, mutual insurance mechanisms, and fiscal tools.
But this struggle to find common ground may prove useful for the wider EU, as its leaders attempt to strike a balance between the responsibility of member governments and the eurozone-wide institutions that the monetary union needs to function effectively.
It may turn out to be easier for Germany’s coalition parties – not to mention the French and German governments – to forge a new framework for bilateral and European security cooperation.
Polls show that concerns about terrorism and internal security outweigh fears over immigration.
If those pressing issues are addressed at the European level, as Merkel suggested in her victory statement, support for Europe could end up winning back the discontented voters who cast their ballots for the AfD.
Whatever government emerges in Germany in the weeks ahead, its leaders will need to devote more effort to explaining their policy choices to citizens and international partners alike.
With the AfD in the Bundestag, the German public will be exposed to more radical positions on foreign affairs – from EU leadership to relations with Russia – than have been heard in over a generation.
While Germany’s center has held, its consensus is about to be tested.

What Is Threatening Science?
CAMBRIDGE – Scientific knowledge and technological innovation, as Yuval Noah Harari emphasizes in his book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, are among the key drivers of economic progress.
Yet there is remarkably little reflection taking place about the state of science today, despite significant challenges, rooted in globalization, the digitization of knowledge, and the growing number of scientists.
At first glance, all of these seem to be positive trends.
Globalization connects scientists worldwide, enabling them to avoid duplication and facilitating the development of universal standards and best practices.
The creation of digital databases allows for systematic mining of scientific output and offers a broader foundation for new investigations.
And the rising number of scientists means that more science is being conducted, accelerating progress.
But these trends are Janus-faced.
To understand why, one must recognize, first, that science is an ecosystem.
Just like any other ecosystem, it is characterized by the push and pull among competing actors.
Universities compete to ascend the research rankings.
Scientific journals compete to publish the most relevant papers.
Conference organizers compete for the most distinguished speakers.
Journalists compete for scoops on the most important breakthroughs.
Funders compete to identify and support the research that will produce the most significant advances in terms of social impact, security, or commercial profitability.
Like in the natural world, this complex competition enables the production of both ecosystem “goods” and “services.”
Our natural ecosystems produce goods in the form of raw materials and services such as maintaining oxygen in the atmosphere, pollinating plants, cleaning air and water, and even providing us with beauty and inspiration.
Our scientific ecosystem’s goods are the independent, distilled, peer-reviewed knowledge that drives our societies and economies forward.
Its services include an improved understanding of our world and the frameworks that best support progress, enabling us to innovate and solve problems.
The scientific ecosystem also serves us in ways that are harder to articulate.
It instills in us an appreciation for the beauty of mathematics, a belief in the inherent values of education, trust in the intrinsic worth of transnational intellectual communities, and interest in scholarly discussion.
Yet funders and governments have undervalued these essential ecosystem services.
And the three trends mentioned above – globalization, digitization of knowledge, and the expanding ranks of scientists – are exacerbating the problem.
As globalization increases competition, it also reinforces certain narratives – such as those dictating which research areas deserve the most funding.
In my meetings with government officials around the world, I have seen this firsthand.
They trumpet the importance of science to their countries’ futures, and then identify the areas that they “uniquely” are spearheading.
The areas are usually the same.
Just as “trending” topics in the media can come to dominate public attention, trending research areas attract the vast majority of funding.
Support for parallel research in the same areas reduces the efficiency of each investment, and such herding behavior by donors may even preclude some of the most significant advances, which often come as a result of combining the results of seemingly unrelated research.
The digitization of knowledge has intensified these effects.
The currency of science is the citation – when one scientist refers to another’s previously published work.
With all scientific publications recorded digitally, citations can be counted instantly, allowing scientists to be ranked accordingly.
The “h-index,” for example, attempts to measure the productivity and impact of a particular scientist using citation data – and it has become a kind of currency.
If a scientist’s h-index is their bitcoin – convertible through salaries and research grants – then citations are the blockchain on which it depends.
Now, again, the same researchers producing the same types of research are being rewarded disproportionately, leaving less room for those with less of this quantifiable esteem.
This trend is exacerbated further by the rise in the number of scientists.
Ask a room full of chemists how many colleagues they have in the world, and no one will know.
Ask how many are needed, and they will look at their shoes.
What is known is that the population of scientists is increasing at a faster rate than the human population as a whole.
More scientists do not mean more discoveries.
What they can cause – through intensifying competition within the ecosystem – is h-index inflation, just as printing more money can cause price inflation.
Given these trends, scientists in recent decades have felt increasingly compelled to oversell their research.
And in the complex and interconnected scientific ecosystem, a solution is not easy to find.
But there are some dynamics that are worth exploring.
Most fundamental, encouraging diversity – of institutions, funding mechanisms, and research approaches – is vital to prevent innovation-killing conformity.
Ecosystems always require diversity for resilience.
Such disruption can come not only from the new mega-rich tech giants, but also from crowd sourcing, and tech-wealthy benefactors.
To support this effort, we could encourage a new breed of science curators to explore the terrain of scientific knowledge more systematically, looking beyond trending topics to identify surprising but promising linkages between research, as well as conflicting results that merit further inquiry.
Finally, the one-dimensional citation metric should be complemented by additional indices that provide a more comprehensive, multifaceted assessment of scientific work.
Only then can the huge number of new minds that join the ranks of the world’s scientific researchers each year actually contribute meaningfully to the advancement of science and, in turn, the progress of humankind.

The New IMF
WASHINGTON, DC – When Ministers meet for the IMF’s Spring Meeting this month they will find an institution with regained self-confidence.
The London G20 summit gave a strengthened mandate to the IMF, while tripling its resources.
More concessional finance will be available for low-income countries, and international liquidity will be increased by a hand-out of $ 250 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs).
This is a boost for the IMF, and it gives hope to emerging and developing countries that have been severely hit by a crisis that originated elsewhere.
The IMF is well-positioned to help its members overcome the financing gaps resulting from the crisis.
In the run-up to the G20 summit access to the Fund’s credit facilities was increased and policy conditions were streamlined.
In a watershed with former practice, a new non-conditional credit line was introduced for well-performing countries.
Mexico and Poland will be its first users and more countries will line up.
These more flexible lending policies reflect a new image of the IMF.
The negative stigma attached to IMF financing is a thing of the past.
Its financing role in this crisis secured, the IMF now needs to strengthen its position as guardian of an open international financial system.
The IMF was created to prevent crises like the current one and in this it has failed.
Admittedly, there were warnings, but policy makers, particularly in advanced countries, did not follow suit.
The ‘new’ IMF should be an institution that communicates better with its members, balances the interests of its advanced, emerging and developing members in an evenhanded manner, and aligns its policies better to the needs of the moment.
Now that the IMF has been given a second lifetime, it needs to regain its central position in the international financial system.
For this, it needs to focus on three issues: improved surveillance of financial stability, strengthened international coordination, and an updated decision-making process.
The new IMF needs to become more vocal on global financial stability issues.
The IMF should see to it that there are no gaps in the surveillance of financial institutions.
It can help shape a more robust global supervisory system which needs to be built in order to preserve the benefits of global financial markets.
And it should help develop a vision on what the future financial landscape should look like.
To this end IMF surveillance should include regular updates on supervisory regimes in systemically important countries.
Early warnings, commissioned by the G20, should be specific and the IMF should monitor whether policymakers give follow-up to the Fund’s advice.
The new IMF needs to take a fresh look at international policy coordination.
The demand for a different monetary order, as advocated by China, sets the stage for a renewed effort to avoid the international imbalances which were at the root of this crisis.
First, the US saving deficit will need to be addressed in a sustainable manner.
Second, China will have to make its currency convertible.
Third, the position of the euro will strengthen over time as more countries will join the euro zone.
With more key currencies in place, the perspective of a truly multipolar currency system comes in sight, with an increased role for the SDR.
This will lessen the need felt by emerging economies for self-insurance against financial instability, by building up large reserves.
Finally, the new IMF needs governance structures that better reflect today’s new global realities.
The perception that advanced countries are running business in the Fund, but do not adhere to Fund advice, has undermined the IMF’s authority.
The G20 summit marked the return of the United States to multilateralism.
This acceptance of collective responsibility should come with abandoning US veto power in the IMF by lowering required voting majorities, as well as abandoning Europe’s prerogative of appointing the Managing Director.
One of the strengths of the IMF’s present governance structure, the constituency system, should be duplicated at the G20 as well, so as to ensure inclusiveness.
The rapid growth of China, India, and other emerging countries should come with increased influence, to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011.
Advanced countries, including European countries, will see a relative decrease in voting power.
An increased say for emerging economies will imply taking more international responsibility as well, also in financial terms.
Now European countries finance 42% of IMF lending and 62% of concessional World Bank lending.
This task will have to be shared by emerging countries with large reserves.
These reserves are put to better use by assisting the IMF in maintaining an open and stable financial system and prevent crises like these from recurring

Four Ways to Beat HIV/AIDS
PITTSBURGH – In the fight against HIV/AIDS, some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others.
In 2009, I heard one such story in Tanzania.
I was visiting a remote village when I spoke to a woman who knew that she was HIV-positive.
She told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of CD4 T-helper cells, a type of white blood cell used by the immune system, had dropped below a certain threshold.
After walking several miles to get her count checked, she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken.
The machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey.
Only months later, after her third trip to the clinic on foot, did she receive her cell count: her levels were far below the necessary threshold.
Her treatment should have begun months before.
Since HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1984, it has killed more than 35 million people.
Although the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005, there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition.
In 2016 alone, one million people around the world died from HIV-related causes, while 1.8 million more became infected.
Contrary to popular myth, we have not turned the corner on AIDS – not by a long shot.
World AIDS Day, on December 1, is an occasion to honor the millions of victims, and to recommit to ending this devastating disease.
According to UNAIDS, just 54% of HIV-positive adults, and only 43% of HIV-positive children, are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections.
With so many untreated patients, the virus will continue to spread.
As CEO of a global pharmaceutical company, I’m proud of the work we have done to fight HIV/AIDS around the world.
Today, more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for HIV in developing countries – depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce.
But for those of us on the front lines of this struggle, our work is far from over.
The pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment, and to help stop the spread of HIV once and for all.
Fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable.
For starters, pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost, generic medicines.
My company, Mylan, introduced the first generic once-daily pill for developing countries in 2009, and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people.
With this treatment alone, Mylan and other generic manufacturers save the US government, international donors, and national health programs more than $4.5 billion a year.
Still, treatment options could be expanded further.
In September, Mylan announced a collaboration with UNAIDS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and other partners to provide the next-generation single-pill HIV regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle-income countries for less than $75 per year.
These drugs are widely used in high-income countries because they produce fewer side effects.
Affordability initiatives like this one should be replicated.
Next, drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply-chain reliability.
Since 2005, the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten, to 21 million.
But roughly twice as many people are currently infected with HIV.
Over the last decade, Mylan has invested more than $250 million in expanding production capacity, and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year.
But further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment.
A third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery.
For example, Mylan provides study medications to research trials, like the MaxART trial in Swaziland, which demonstrated that providing treatment to all HIV-positive people is the best way to slow the disease’s spread.
We also supported the Kirby Institute’s ENCORE1 trial, to develop a reduced-dose version of the most commonly used HIV treatment regimen.
And we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called OPTIMIZE, which aims to accelerate access to new therapies.
We do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property – we won’t.
Rather, we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment.
Finally, real gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health-care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve.
Antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges.
Drugs for young people produced in the West are often liquids that require refrigeration.
But developing countries often have limited cold-storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk.
That’s why Mylan has developed heat-stable, taste-masked, dispersible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food.
Our scientists are now working on the next-generation formula, which comes in the equivalent of a sugar packet that even newborns can take.
More innovations like these will be needed to solve the country-specific issues that patients face.
The global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on HIV/AIDS, introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment.
But when I think back to the woman I met in Tanzania, I am reminded of how much work remains to be done.
Makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight, and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it.

An IMF We Can Love?
CAMBRIDGE – What a difference the crisis has made for the International Monetary Fund.
It was just a few months ago that this important but unloved institution, a landmark of post-war global economic arrangements, seemed destined to irrelevance.
The IMF has long been a whipping boy for both left and right – the former because of the Fund’s emphasis on fiscal rectitude and economic orthodoxy, and the latter because of its role in bailing out indebted nations.
Developing nations grudgingly took its advice, while advanced nations, not needing the money, ignored it.
In a world where private capital flows dwarf the resources at its disposal, the IMF had come to seem an anachronism.
And, when some of the IMF’s largest debtors (Brazil and Argentina) began to prepay their debts a few years ago with no new borrowers in sight, it looked like the final nail in the coffin had been struck.
The IMF seemed condemned to run out of income, in addition to losing its raison d’être.
It shrank its budgets and began to downsize, and, while it was handed some new responsibilities in the meantime – surveillance over “currency manipulation,” in particular – its deliberations proved largely irrelevant.
But the crisis has invigorated the IMF.
Under its capable managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Fund has been one of the few official agencies ahead of – instead of behind – the curve. It moved quickly to establish a fast-disbursing emergency line of credit for countries with “reasonable” policies.
It ardently championed global fiscal stimulus on the order of 2% of world GNP – a position that is all the more remarkable in view of its traditional conservatism on all fiscal matters.
And, in the run-up to the G-20 summit in London, it thoroughly overhauled its lending policies, de-emphasizing traditional conditionality and making it easier for countries to qualify for loans.
Even more significantly, the IMF has emerged from the London meeting with substantially greater resources, as well as new responsibilities.
The G-20 promised to triple the Fund’s lending capacity (from $250 billion to $750 billion), issue $250 billion of new Special Drawing Rights (a reserve asset made up of a basket of major currencies), and permit the Fund to borrow in capital markets (which it has never done) if necessary.
The IMF was also designated as one of two lead agencies – along with an expanded Financial Stability Forum (now renamed the Financial Stability Board) – charged with providing early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and issuing the requisite policy recommendations.
Another piece of good news is that the Europeans have now given up their claim on naming the IMF’s managing director (as have the Americans their corresponding claim on the World Bank presidency).
These senior officials are henceforth to be selected “through an open, transparent, and merit-based selection process.” This will provide for better governance (although Strauss-Kahn’s leadership has been exemplary), and will enhance both institutions’ legitimacy in the eyes of developing nations.
So the IMF now finds itself at the center of the economic universe once again.
How will it choose to deploy its newfound power?
The greatest risk is that it will once again over-reach and over-play its hand.
That is what happened in the second half of the 1990’s, as the IMF began to preach capital-account liberalization, applied over-stringent fiscal remedies during the Asian financial crisis, and single-handedly tried to reshape Asian economies. The institution has since acknowledged its errors in all these areas.
But it remains to be seen if the lessons have been fully internalized, and whether we will have a kinder, gentler IMF in lieu of a rigid, doctrinaire one.
One encouraging fact is that developing countries will almost certainly get a larger say in how the Fund is run.
This will ensure that poorer nations’ views receive a more sympathetic hearing in the future.
But simply giving developing nations greater voting power will make little difference if the IMF’s organizational culture is not changed as well.
The Fund is staffed by a large number of smart economists, who lack much connection to (and appreciation for) the institutional realities of the countries on which they work.
Their professional expertise is validated by the quality of their advanced degrees, rather than by their achievements in practical policymaking.
This breeds arrogance and a sense of smug superiority over their counterparts – policymakers who must balance multiple, complicated agendas.
Countering this will require proactive efforts by the IMF’s top leadership in recruitment, staffing, and promotion.
One option would be to increase substantially the number of mid-career recruits with actual practical experience in developing countries. This would make the IMF staff more cognizant of the value of local knowledge relative to theoretical expertise.
Another strategy would be to relocate some of the staff, including those in functional departments, to “regional offices” in the field.
This move would likely face considerable resistance from staff who have gotten used to the perks of Washington, DC.
But there is no better way to appreciate the role of context than to live in it.
The World Bank, which engaged in a similar decentralization a while back, has become better at serving its clients as a result (without facing difficulties in recruiting top talent).
This is an important moment for the IMF.
The international community is putting great store in the Fund’s judgment and performance.
The Fund will require internal reforms to earn that trust fully.

Erdoğan’s Second Chance
ISTANBUL – The outcome of Turkey’s latest general election – voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months – reveals important insights into the nature of the country’s democracy and the preferences of its citizens.
The first of Turkey’s two parliamentary elections this year, in June, was widely viewed as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s efforts to strengthen the powers of his office.
The result was clear.
Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) received just 41% of the vote, costing it the majority it had enjoyed since coming to power in 2002.
On November 1, however, after negotiations following the June elections resulted in a hung parliament, Turks voted again, and the outcome could not have been more different.
This time, the election was predominantly perceived as a referendum on the continuation of single-party rule, and the AKP won 49% of the vote, providing it with a comfortable majority.
In the run-up to the latest election, Erdoğan and the AKP emphasized the importance of the party’s parliamentary majority for Turkey’s political stability.
The opposition countered with the argument that a coalition government would counter the country’s deep political polarization, while helping to establish stronger checks and balances.
The promise of stability proved to be the more resonant message.
The political instability following June’s inconclusive election had been compounded by a sharp decline in domestic and regional security.
A renewed campaign of violence by the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and attacks by the Islamic State, including suicide bombings in Ankara that killed more than 100 people, created a backdrop that reinforced the AKP’s message.
The outcome of the vote attests to the ineffectiveness of Turkey’s parliamentary opposition, which once again failed to make a dent in the AKP’s popularity, almost as if they had set out to disprove the theory that electorates simply tire of long-serving governments.
Instead the AKP obtained its landslide victory – a major achievement after 13 years of uninterrupted rule – by siphoning voters from its competitors.
The party received nearly five million more votes than it did in June, corresponding to a 20% increase in its popularity.
Two opposition parties, the conservative Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the predominantly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), together lost three million votes, while the center-left Republican People’s Party (CHP) held its ground, finishing second with 25% of the vote.
Voters punished the nationalist MHP severely for its obstructionism following the June election, when it refused all offers to join a coalition government.
With 12% of the popular vote, compared to 16% in June, the MHP lost almost half of its parliamentary seats.
The HDP was handicapped by its inability to distance itself from the PKK, which a large section of the electorate regards as being responsible for the upsurge in domestic violence.
Indeed, the HDP seemed at risk of failing to obtain the 10% of the vote it would need to enter parliament, an outcome that would have provided the AKP with a majority large enough to amend the constitution on its own.
In the end, HDP ended with 10.75% of the vote, down from 13% in the June elections, preventing Erdoğan from securing the compliant parliament he would need to establish an executive presidency.
Nonetheless, Turkey’s new government has been provided with a broad enough mandate to address some of the country’s most difficult and imminent policy challenges – most notably the peace process with the Kurds.
A previous effort had been suspended ahead of the election, as the PKK returned to violence and the AKP’s leadership adopted increasingly nationalist and hawkish rhetoric.
With the election over, however, there is hope that the new government will restart the negotiations.
If successful, the talks would have a major impact not only domestically, but also on the ongoing fight against the Islamic State.
The AKP’s majority will also enable it to continue to recalibrate the country’s foreign policy.
Turkey’s policies following the Arab Spring had led to a loss of influence and friends in the region; but recently the country has begun to adapt its approach to the realities on the ground.
For example, Turkey has lifted its objections to a role for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in negotiations to end the civil war in Syria.
Similarly, a new commitment to the struggle against the Islamic State has eliminated a core point of friction with Turkey’s Western partners.
The main trap the new government must avoid is a return to a heavily paternalistic style of governance.
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent more benignly, in a way that befits a country negotiating accession to the European Union.
The lesson of the two elections is clear: Turkey’s voters want a strong, stable government, but not one that runs roughshod over its opponents.

Strengthening African Science
URBANA, ILLINOIS – In late March, Africa’s leading scientists, innovators, and policymakers met in Kigali, Rwanda, to brainstorm solutions to an increasingly pressing problem: the low quality of science on the continent.
Any good leader knows that scientific discovery and innovation fuels progress, facilitates development, and can help tackle issues like food insecurity, water shortages, and climate change.
And yet most African governments are failing to fund research and development adequately in their countries.
According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa spend, on average, just 0.5% of GDP on research and development.
In the West, the share is closer to 3%.
This disparity underscores the development challenges that Africans face.
Africa is home to 15% of the world’s population and 5% of its GDP, but accounts for a paltry 1.3% of total research spending.
Moreover, African inventors hold just 0.1% of the world’s patents, meaning that even when money is spent on science, innovation, and research, the findings rarely translate into solutions for the continent’s most immediate challenges.
To be sure, these trends are not universal; some African governments are investing heavily in science-led innovation.
In South Africa, for example, authorities have pledged to double R&D spending by 2020 – to 1.5% of GDP.
This follows a 2016 commitment by African heads of state to increase science and technology budgets to at least 1% of GDP by 2025.
A handful of countries – including Kenya, Rwanda, and Senegal – are working hard to reach this funding threshold.
Africa also benefits from generous research-related aid and international support.
One of the top donors, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has invested more than $450 million in African science initiatives over the last decade.
Projects include a $306 million program to boost crop yields and a $62.5 million grant to improve health outcomes.
These and other funding streams have helped African researchers develop drought-resistant crops, produce vaccines for infectious diseases like Ebola, and expand opportunities for science and technology education.
Unfortunately, many African governments lack the resources to fund programs that could build on these gains.
Simply put, a new, more collaborative approach to African science is urgently needed.
Africa’s leaders have pooled their science resources before.
In 2003, the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development began implementing a continent-wide strategy “to develop and use science and technology for the socioeconomic transformation of the continent and its integration into the world economy.”
It was an ambitious goal that yielded early results.
Between 2005 and 2014, continent-wide spending on R&D increased, while research output more than doubled in many countries.
Since then, however, progress has stalled.
The recent meeting in Rwanda, hosted by President Paul Kagame and organized by the Next Einstein Forum, was designed to help get the agenda back on track.
But summits are only part of the solution; governments must also commit to improving research quality, and they can start by focusing attention on three key areas.
First, Africa’s leaders must engage with CEOs, philanthropists, and donors who understand the long-term value of investing in science.
Innovation is expensive, and seed money will be needed to help strengthen the continent’s scientific capacity.
Second, African universities and institutions should align their research agendas with national and regional goals.
For example, given that one of Africa’s most pressing challenges is feeding its growing population, schools specializing in agricultural research should ensure that their work contributes to solutions.
Last but not least, countries should encourage entrepreneurship within research organizations.
One way to do this is by establishing commercialization offices, which could help scientists bring their research to market.
Scientists everywhere need help navigating bureaucracy when turning an idea into a commercial venture, and this process is particularly challenging in a region where R&D pipelines are in their infancy.
Boosting Africa’s scientific capabilities will require the continent’s leaders to do more than ask tough questions at summits; they must also allocate more funding and forge new partnerships.
To overcome Africa’s human development challenges, African governments must invest in the people who can overcome them.

More Bad News at the IMF
CAMBRIDGE: Bad news is all the IMF has been getting in the last year.
First came a divisive fight over naming a new Managing Director: Germany pushed a little known and unqualified bureaucrat and failed to have him accepted.
In the end, Chancellor Schroder was given a fig leaf to hide his embarrassment in the form of the present managing director, Horst Kohler, whose main qualification for the job is being German, unlike his two predecessors De Larosiere and Camdessus, who were distinguished French inspecteusr de finances, i.e. they belonged to the cream of cream in the bureaucratic elite of France.
The next slap came from criticism by American Republicans of the IMF’s strategy as nothing but unending bailouts.
That criticism was enshrined in the Meltzer Report, which now hangs even more ominously over the IMF because the Republicans now rule in Washington.
America’s Congress has never had much sympathy for the IMF.
Democrats question tough-minded programs; Republicans criticize bailouts; nobody has anything constructive to offer. But criticism of the IMF not only comes from the American right.
A few shots across the bow came from inside the community, from just across the street at the World Bank.
The most notable barrage here was the affaire Stiglitz, when the World Bank’s chief economist accused the IMF of malpractice, gaining applause from bad economists and failed policy makers worldwide.
The latest hits have just happened. First came the resignation of IMF chief economist Michael Mussa, a formidable University of Chicago-educated economist renowned for good judgment.
He predicted most of the crises that came along but that did not raise his popularity with the IMF’s board.
Mussa was also remarkable for a flamboyant presentation of his views, which was hard for some IMF folk to tolerate in so stuffy environment.
The final hit is comes in the form of the resignation of the IMF’s first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, who was in charge of assuring continuity and good sense as well as staff morale.
These two departures come on top of a steady exodus of talent to Wall Street in recent years.
So the IMF is at a cross roads, it is weak in leadership, weak on economics knowledge at its top, weak in the support it gets from its member countries.
The IMF has become a household word, but one with unfavorable connotations.
Ask any undergraduate about the IMF and the answer, however vague, is invariably negative.
Ask any leftist activist, and the IMF competes with greedy multinationals as the lowest form of life.
Part of this negative assessment is inevitable: by the time a country comes to the IMF it is on its way to the economic emergency room. Radical surgery usually follows.
The fact that recovery does come is noted less than the time spent in hospital.
IMF policies are criticized more than the awful policies that incited a country to collapse in the first place.
Turkey today is a case in point, or Russia, or Asia in 1997-98.
What can the IMF do?
Little by itself, of course, because it is governed by its member countries and that means the US, Europe (which does not speak with one voice), and Japan (which has no voice).
The most important issue now is the Fischer succession.
The right person should not necessarily be an American as that would unduly limit the choice and risks bringing an appointment more distinguished by ideology than competence.
Doling out top international jobs by nationality is a terrible practice and choosing Fischer’s replacement presents a wonderful opportunity to make a break with this routine.
The successful appointee should be, above all, an effective administrator and a top economist experienced in policymaking.
But the IMF must also reinvent itself to become far more focused; it may not be able to change its image but it can become more effective.
There are two ways to do this:
- resist the temptation of mission creep: the IMF is widening its focus to poverty issues, corruption issues, environment issues, governance issues.
All these are important, all these are remotely affected by IMF policies, none of them can get around the central truth that a country which has hit the ropes needs to practice austerity.
The IMF is well advised to stay away from the details and not stretch its little political capital to so broad a range of issues with an inevitable failure in satisfying the whole range of partners in an ever-wider dialogue;
- increase transparency.
The IMF staff must begin to report, publicly and for everyone to see, the shortcomings in countries' balance sheets and currency strategies because these are invariably the causes of collapse.
Over and over again, Turkey being the latest example, the IMF is mute for too long.
The IMF board must learn that muzzling the IMF staff contributes to crisis by postponing a reckoning.
The IMF is an important part of the international financial architecture, but it is in great need of repair.
It needs a strong and respected leadership in the top ranks and it needs a refocusing of its mission and a shift from emergency operations to preventive medicine.
Because the IMF is at a crossroads, now is the time for serious reforms, not a quick fix.

Iran: One Year Later
WASHINGTON, DC – This month marks the one-year anniversary of the contested re-election of hard-line Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which spurred the country’s largest popular uprisings since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
While the regime gradually succeeded in violently quelling the momentum of the opposition Green Movement, the country’s deep internal rifts – both among political elites as well as between government and society – are far from being reconciled.
Among the numerous post-election casualties was the notion of Iran as an “Islamic Republic.”
As the late Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri put it, the regime’s brutality towards its own people has rendered it “neither Islamic nor a Republic.”
Another casualty was the legitimacy of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
For two decades, Khamenei deceptively cultivated an image of an impartial and magnanimous guide, but his defiant public support for Ahmadinejad exposed him as a petty, partisan autocrat.
Among the unprecedented slogans of last summer’s street protests were thunderous chants of “Khamenei is a murderer, his leadership is void!”
Under Khamenei’s leadership, an unholy trinity of nouveau-riche Revolutionary Guardsmen, hard-line clergymen, and indoctrinated Basij militiamen increasingly wield power.
Despite his religious pretensions as a spiritual guide, Khamenei’s future rests largely in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards.
While opposition to his rule among top clerics in Qom worries Khamenei, opposition within the Revolutionary Guard could be fatal for him.
Despite the government’s crisis of legitimacy and endemic mismanagement, the Green Movement – nominally led by opposition presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi – faces major obstacles.
Their brain trust is either in prison, under virtual house arrest, or unable to communicate freely.
They lack organization and strategy.
As protests began last year, the grass-roots nature of the Green Movement was initially thought to be advantageous, given that it could not be easily decapitated. “Thirty years ago people were sheep and Khomeini was their shepherd,” a prominent Iranian democratic activist told me.
Despite their strength in numbers however, Mousavi and Karroubi’s excessive reliance on street protests is misguided.
While their courageous supporters espouse tolerance and practice non-violence, they are overwhelmed by armed government forces who are willing to kill and die to retain power.
If the Green Movement is to mount a serious challenge to the government it must incorporate support from bazaar merchants, workers in major industries, transportation unions, and government workers.
Sustained strikes by these groups would bring the country’s economy to a halt. This is a tall order, however, given that Iran’s labor groups, while deeply discontented, are just as amorphous as the Green Movement itself.
What’s more, Mousavi and Karroubi, perhaps chastened in part by the unfulfilled promises and excesses of the Islamic Revolution – are seemingly in no hurry to see abrupt change.
Instead, they have pursued a gradualist approach that aims to co-opt and recruit disaffected members of the traditional classes, including clergy and Revolutionary Guardsmen, to the Green Movement.
The Green Movement’s deliberate approach is complicated by the sense of urgency that the United States, Europe, and especially Israel, feel about the Iranian government’s nuclear ambitions.
While the role that outside powers like the US can play in affecting political reform in Iran is limited, the Obama administration faces two fundamental challenges in its Iran policy.
First, how do you reach an accommodation with a regime that seemingly needs you as an adversary?
While a large majority of Iranians want to make amends with the US, for Iran’s hardliners, enmity toward the US has become a central part of the Islamic Republic’s identity. “If pro-American tendencies come to power in Iran, we have to say goodbye to everything,” conceded Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of the powerful Guardian Council.
The second challenge for the US is to champion human rights and democracy in Iran without compromising the independence of opposition forces.
Given the diversity of the Green Movement, there is no clear consensus as to which US policies are most constructive.
There is a seemingly universal belief that America should absolutely refrain from military action, condemn the Islamic Republic’s human rights abuses, and express moral solidarity with the Iranian people.
There is little agreement, however, when it comes to more contentious questions, such as the potential efficacy of targeted sanctions.
Iran’s first post-revolution prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, reportedly once said that the real leader of the 1979 revolution was not Ayatollah Khomeini but rather the Shah, who united diverse groups of people against him.
Today, a somewhat similar dynamic exists: the two individuals arguably most responsible for the opposition’s resilience are not Mousavi and Karroubi, but Ahmadinejad and Khamenei.
Governmental brutality and intimidation can withstand the march of history for years, but not indefinitely.
Whatever becomes of the Green Movement in the short term, millions of courageous Iranian protestors made clear to the world last summer that their country’s centennial quest for a democracy is an idea whose time has come.

Big Tech Flies Too Much
“If we don’t curb emissions, and temperatures continue to climb,” the firm said on its official blog, “science tells us that the results will be catastrophic.” Microsoft deserves credit for publicly discussing the climate crisis, being transparent about its own greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, and at least having some sort of plan to reduce them.
But the elephant in the room is that Microsoft is one of the top ten corporate buyers of commercial flights in the United States.
Before the pandemic, in the financial year 2019, the firm’s business travel alone accounted for 392,557 metric tons of GHG emissions.
That’s far more than my entire Pacific island country emits in a year.
Tuvalu is well known for its vulnerability to the effects of climate change.
We contribute almost nothing to global GHG emissions, but their consequences affect us on a monthly or even daily basis.
Microsoft’s high level of corporate air travel is not a good look for a company that talks big on climate, sustainability, and racial justice, especially one that literally has its own videoconferencing platform.
Surely an advanced tech firm that claims to be “reimagining virtual collaboration for the future of work” should practice what it preaches, crank up Microsoft Teams, and fly less.
But Microsoft is hardly an outlier among tech firms. Five of the ten largest buyers of corporate air travel in the US are technology companies: Amazon, IBM, Google, Apple, and Microsoft.
These digital giants, along with the big consulting firms, are also among the top buyers of flights globally.
Although one might expect these big, growing companies’ large number of employees to fly to many meetings, there are plenty of even bigger employers that fly less.
Companies that tout technological innovation as the key to tackling climate change should be savvy enough to use video calls, rather than shuttle employees around the planet on airlines that before the pandemic burned 7-8 million barrels of oil per day – more than India.
In May last year, a paper in the journal Nature Climate Change found that the pause to aviation accounted for 10% of the decrease in global emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Given that only 4% of the global population took an international flight in 2018, and that half of all aviation emissions come from just 1% of the global population, this outsize impact shows not only how often the 1% fly, but also that flying is a function of privilege.
And according to the International Air Transport Association, many, if not the majority, of frequent flyers are businesspeople.
Microsoft, which is so committed to business travel that it has its own priority check-in lane at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, sits near the top of a highly unequal and skewed global carbon hierarchy.
The wealthiest (and often the whitest) pollute the most, while those who emit the least – predominantly people of color, the socially vulnerable, and inhabitants of the Global South, including the Pacific – bear the costs.
Comparatively wealthy flyers must recognize their responsibility to those less fortunate, who deserve to live without fear of global warming’s effects.
Climate-vulnerable people want to maintain their homes and identities as citizens of their country, rather than being forced to migrate elsewhere.
If concern for equality and climate justice won’t cure Big Tech’s corporate flight addiction, maybe money will.
The profits of Amazon and other large technology firms soared during last year’s lockdowns, even when commercial flights were reduced to zero for many months.
Chief financial officers and accountants are therefore now wondering whether the expense of business flights makes any sense.
Employees can hold more meetings in a day via videoconference, and business flyers say the pause in air travel either had no impact on their productivity, or actually improved it.
Bill Gates has predicted that business travel will decline by half after the pandemic.
If that’s the baseline, then what would a company truly committed to urgent climate action do?
With that question top of mind, a coalition of NGOs, activists, and Microsoft customers recently launched JustUseTeams.com, calling on Microsoft to take the lead and announce that it will permanently lock in all of its 2020 reduction in business flights.
Once Microsoft shows some leadership on this issue, the campaign will expand to other tech firms.
On the road to net-zero emissions, any step that advances that goal while saving a company millions of dollars a year should be considered low-hanging fruit.
Tech firms will claim that they have been trying to pluck it, but their actions are inadequate to the climate crisis we face.
Microsoft, for example, is part of an initiative to promote sustainable fuels.
But the airline industry has consistently failed to meet its own targets for scaling up such fuels, which still account for less than 0.1% of the sector’s use.
Meanwhile, many Big Tech firms buy “carbon credits,” and maintain that this somehow erases or “offsets” their own flight emissions.
But this claim is losing whatever scientific credibility it once may have had.
A recent investigation revealed that the most popular carbon-offset scheme used by airlines is based on a flawed system, in which so-called “phantom credits” are often sold on the promise to protect forest areas that were never at risk of being cut down.
In reality, neither airlines nor their biggest corporate customers are in a position to claim that their flights are “carbon neutral.”
Microsoft and other big technology companies therefore must commit to remain permanently at their 2020 flight levels.
This is possible, necessary, and fair.
It is also good business.

The Resistible Rise of US-China Conflict
CAMBRIDGE – US President Joe Biden’s economic and foreign policies may represent a sharp departure from those of his predecessor, Donald Trump.
But when it comes to relations with China, Biden has largely maintained Trump’s tough line – refusing, for example, to reverse Trump’s tariff hikes on Chinese exports and warning of further punitive trade measures.
This reflects the widespread hardening of US attitudes towards China.
When Foreign Affairs magazine recently asked leading US experts whether American “foreign policy has become too hostile to China,” nearly half of the respondents (32 out of 68) disagreed or disagreed strongly – suggesting a preference for an even tougher US stance toward China.
For economists, who tend to view the world in positive-sum terms, this is a puzzle. Countries can make themselves and others better off by cooperating and by shunning conflict.
The clearest application of this principle is the gains from trade that countries achieve – the bread and butter of professional economists.
It is generally in each country’s benefit to open its domestic markets to others.
But the same idea extends also to policy domains where there could be tensions between domestic and global interests.
Yes, countries could pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies, such as restricting access to home markets to improve their terms of trade, or free ride on global public goods such as decarbonization policies.
But wouldn’t it be better if they refrained from such actions so they could collectively all do better?
Geopolitical strategists, by contrast, tend to see the world instead in zero-sum terms.
Nation-states compete for power – the ability to bend others to their will and pursue their interests unhindered – which is necessarily relative.
If one country has more power, its rival must have less.
Such a world is necessarily conflictual, as great powers (the United States) or rising powers (China) jockey for regional and global dominance.
In a recent article, John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago provides a forceful articulation of this view.
Mearsheimer was among those in the Foreign Affairs survey who disagreed strongly with the proposition that US policy may have become too hostile toward China. “All great powers, be they democracies or not,” he writes, “have little choice but to compete for power in what is at root a zero-sum game.”
The implications for US-China relations are bleak: China is bound to want to expand its power, and the US has no option but to try to contain it. This perspective sets an important challenge for economists and others who believe in the feasibility of a stable, peaceful, and largely cooperative world in which the US and China can prosper together.
“Realist” theorists of international relations such as Mearsheimer and my Harvard University colleague Stephen Walt are clearly correct when they argue against the “liberal” presumption that open markets in the US and rules-based multilateralism would produce a China that looked “more like us.”
The American policy of engagement with China, pursued until the Trump administration took over, may have helped China grow richer, but it made the country neither more democratic nor less likely to compete for power and influence.
But does a China with a decidedly different economic and political system and strategic interests of its own imply inevitable conflict with the West?
Perhaps not.
The realists’ argument about the primacy of power hinges on assumptions that need to be qualified.
First, while states may prioritize national security and survival above all else, there is a big gap between meeting these narrower objectives and maximizing power.
The US would be secure from annihilation or invasion even without a military presence on every continent.
The historian Stephen Wertheim has argued that the expansionist vision of US foreign policy has always competed with a more restrained approach, misleadingly and dismissively labeled as “isolationism.”
China’s territorial integrity will remain uncontested even without saber rattling vis-à-vis neighbors.
Beyond a baseline of security, the pursuit of power competes with other national goals, such as domestic economic prosperity, that require less bullying on the world stage.
It is true, as realists like to point out, that the world lacks an enforcer of rules.
There is no world government to ensure that states act in accordance with rules that they may have an interest in enacting but little interest in following.
This makes cooperation more difficult to elicit – but not entirely so.
Game theory, real-world experience, and lab experiments all suggest that reciprocity induces cooperation.
A third-party enforcer is not necessarily required to elicit cooperative behavior in repeated interactions.
Finally, it is also true that uncertainty and the risk of misperceiving other states’ intentions complicate prospects for international cooperation among great powers.
Purely defensive measures – whether economic or military – are likely to be perceived as threats, cumulating through a vicious cycle of escalation.
But this problem, too, can be mitigated to some extent.
As Walt and I have argued, what might help is a framework that facilitates communication and encourages mutual justification of actions that may be misinterpreted by the other side.
Mearsheimer is skeptical that creative institutional design can make much of a difference. “The driving force behind [US-China] great-power rivalry is structural,” he writes, “which means that the problem cannot be eliminated with clever policymaking.”
But structure does not fully determine equilibrium in a complicated system where the definition of national interests, the strategies pursued, and the information available to actors are all dependent on our choices to some extent.
The structure of great-power rivalry may exclude a world of love and harmony, but it does not necessitate a world of immutable conflict.
It does not preclude any of the myriad alternatives that lie between these extremes.
Structure is not destiny: We retain the agency to craft a better (or worse) world order.

Can Italy Survive Berlusconi?
If history seems likely to rank Silvio Berlusconi as an inconsequential Prime Minister of Italy, it will surely remember him as an extraordinary – and extraordinarily bizarre – one.
Promising one thing and delivering another was not so much a weakness of his government as its organizing principle.
Given the erratic nature of Berlusconi’s rule, it is no surprise that, ever since the 2001 election that returned him to power, the center-left l’Unione coalition has won all subsequent elections – administrative, regional, and European.
Yet the left’s prospects in the upcoming parliamentary election are far from certain, and Berlusconi seems far from doomed.
Given the country’s economic conditions, one would think that Italy is ripe for decisive change.
For the last four years, average growth in incomes has been a mere 0.3%, compared to 1.5% in the European Union, and in the past two years public debt has again started to rise.
Moreover, the strategy of Berlusconi’s ruling center-right Casa della Libertà coalition has been to tread water and wait for Europe’s economy to pick up instead of tackling Italy’s structural difficulties.
As a result, the government is criticized not only by the unions, but also by the employers’ association, Confindustria, which in 2001 gave Prime Minister Berlusconi strong support.
Then there is the ongoing conflict of interests between Berlusconi-the-Premier and Berlusconi-the-magnate, who holds public licenses that make him a semi-monopolist in media and TV advertising.
During Berlusconi’s tenure in office, his enormous personal assets have tripled.
While his parliamentary majority has approved many laws that promote his personal interests and have eased some of his legal difficulties, at the beginning of March, Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax fraud.
Berlusconi’s ministers have scarcely behaved better.
Two were forced to resign within a month of each other.
Roberto Calderoli, a prominent official in Lega Nord, the third-largest government party, provoked riots in Libya by wearing a t-shirt printed with the infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.
Francesco Storace, the former Minister of Health and a leading member of Alleanza Nazionale, the second-largest government party, is suspected of organizing political espionage, in an Italian-style Watergate.
But, despite the government’s catastrophic economic and ethical record, opinion polls indicate a lead of only about four percentage points for l’Unione—too small, given the high number of undecided voters, to predict the election’s outcome.
So what is keeping Berlusconi and his coalition in the race?
Above all, Berlusconi’s electoral campaign is aimed, in the manner of President Bush’s 2004 re-election campaign, at energizing his hard-core supporters and mobilizing the growing number of voters who have abstained in recent years.
In doing this he has not hesitated to use his semi-monopoly over television to exalt his government’s alleged accomplishments.
His campaign rhetoric highlights anti-communism with an emphasis not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled with a defense of the family and values cherished by the Roman Catholic establishment, although the Church has so far resisted being drawn into the campaign.
The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l’Unione.
Its leader, Romano Prodi, obtained an extraordinary popular endorsement when more than four million people voted for him in Italy’s first-ever primary elections.
Yet Prodi continues to be a party-less leader of too many parties.
To be sure, the cohesiveness of l’Unione has strengthened: the two major parties (Democratici di Sinistra and Democrazia e Libertà - la Margherita) are united under the symbol of the olive tree, the other parties have endorsed a detailed 280-page government program, and the left-wing Partito della Rifondazione Comunista has given clear signs of moderation and loyalty to the coalition.
For voters, however, a perception of fragility remains.
Finally, the uncertainty of the outcome reflects not so much voters’ behavior, but a change in the electoral system.
During the past decade, Italy has used a majority electoral system corrected by a proportional quota.
Under this system, Casa della Libertà translated a small popular majority in 2001 into a decisive parliamentary majority.
But, with the same result on the horizon this year for l’Unione, the center-right parliamentary majority changed the electoral law just a few months before the end of its term.
This is reminiscent of an army that, fearing defeat on the battlefield, poisons the wells as it retreats.
A proportional system in the absence of individual preferences means that party secretaries, rather than citizens, will choose deputies, and, with no effective electoral threshold, the number of parties will proliferate.
Although the election ballot will be 40 centimeters long to accommodate all the symbols of the old and new parties, it won’t contain the name of even a single candidate.
But the worst problem is that the majority system for the Senate could lead to a different majority gaining control there than in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house), which may well cause legislative paralysis.
Moreover, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi’s mandate ends at the same time that parliament dissolves, which means that his successor, elected by the new parliament, would have to nominate a government without a majority in both houses.
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a German-style grand coalition – an outcome that seems especially unlikely following an election campaign in which both contestants have strongly hinted that their opponent has no legitimate right to govern.
At the same time, holding another vote would leave the question of the electoral law unresolved.
The puzzle of Berlusconi’s survival reflects a wider European conundrum.
Many Europeans, not just Italians, are nervous and unsure of where the continent is going.
So it is no surprise that an opportunist and charlatan like Berlusconi continues to get a hearing.
Italians must decide upon the sort of Italy they want if they are to get leaders of the stature they need.
