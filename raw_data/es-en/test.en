Lebanon’s Dysfunctional Political Economy
PARIS – Lebanon’s economy has collapsed.
There is little confusion about why or what is needed to save it.
The question is why nothing has been done.
For the last two decades, Lebanon had been living off capital inflows, averaging 20% of GDP per year.
Thanks to high interest rates, deposits – largely denominated in US dollars – grew to about 400% of Lebanon’s GDP, with much of the money being lent to the state to finance large fiscal deficits.
Last July, the current-account deficit was over 25% of GDP, and public debt exceeded 150% of GDP.
Government securities and deposits at the central bank accounted for 14% and 55% of bank assets, respectively, for a total sovereign exposure of nearly 70% of assets.
Meanwhile, GDP growth has been close to zero since 2011.
The house of cards collapsed late last year, when large withdrawals led to a run on deposits, followed by a sudden stop to capital inflows.
By the beginning of this year, Lebanon was mired in a triple crisis: both the state and the banks were bankrupt, lacking liquidity and unable to borrow, and the country suffered from a yawning external deficit.
In March, the government announced that it could not meet its debt-repayment obligations.
Hoping to stave off a sovereign default, it then worked with international experts to develop an economic-reform plan that would address the economy’s weaknesses, including by reducing public debt, shrinking the fiscal deficit, and devaluing the Lebanese pound.
A banking-sector restructuring – with a significant share of the immense losses (about $90 billion) set to be borne by bank owners and large depositors – was also planned.
So far, not a single step has been taken to implement any of these reforms.
Lebanon’s government did request some $10 billion from the International Monetary Fund, but negotiations have gone nowhere.
In the meantime, the authorities have not even imposed capital controls – the most fundamental response to a financial crisis.
Progress has been made toward shrinking the external deficit, but not in a way that should be welcomed.
Imports have collapsed by nearly half since 2018, owing to the currency crisis.
This, together with a lack of access to credit and the COVID-19 shock, has caused many firms to shut down.
Meanwhile, GDP has declined by double digits, unemployment has soared above 30%, and the poverty rate has skyrocketed to 50%, decimating the middle class.
A human-capital exodus has begun.
In this context, the government’s failure to act may seem shocking.
Yet torpor is in Lebanon’s political DNA.
The country has a byzantine sectarian power-sharing system, often paralyzed by squabbling and corruption.
Lebanon’s political elites know that the prospect of a flood of refugees is a powerful bargaining chip in international negotiations, so they are happy to subsist on foreign-exchange reserves while waiting to collect geopolitical rents.
Worse, Lebanon’s political and economic elites – there is considerable overlap between them – may be deliberately seeking to shift the losses resulting from their economic mismanagement onto the population.
In May, the Association of Banks in Lebanon proposed its own economic-reform plan, which recommends using state assets to avoid damaging banks.
In other words, ordinary people would bear the burden of adjustment.
Moreover, the central bank has fired up the printing press, inflating away its pound-denominated holdings in an effort to bolster its foreign-exchange reserves.
The pound has lost 80% of its value in just nine months, with year-on-year inflation having reached 90% in June.
At the same time, withdrawals from dollar-denominated bank accounts are being taxed at 50% or more, by converting them at the official exchange rate, rather than the much more advantageous parallel rate.
This approach – essentially an adaptation of Argentina’s “Corralito,” the deposit freeze that was enacted in 2001 to halt a bank run – pushes losses onto the middle class, whose only option is to live on what remains in their bank accounts.
It is also extremely costly economically.
Absorbing the losses will take years, during which Lebanon will have to cope with a lack of capital inflows, a monetary anchor, or trust in the currency and banking system.
At that point, Lebanon’s elites seem to hope, the country will have created enough fiscal space that they can secure a favorable deal with international creditors and reprise their plundering of the state.
This would set the stage for a grim future, in which elites claim an even larger share of a much smaller pie.
Yet there is reason to hope that they won’t get their wish.
Last October, a national protest movement emerged, fueled by years of pent-up rage.
In recent months, that movement has begun to mature, with protesters organizing into groupings that aim to overhaul the country’s political system.
Of course, Lebanon’s sectarian political system will not be upended easily, not least because sectarianism feeds on fear and insecurity.
But the scale of the current crisis has shattered the regime’s legitimacy.
Even Iran-allied Hezbollah, which has thus far defended a political arrangement that protects its weapons, is fast losing popularity among its constituency.
It helps that the international community is, for once, standing firm in its demands for reform.
Though this will probably cause the crisis to worsen in the short term, as Lebanon’s elites attempt to wait out their international interlocutors, it could ultimately force the country to enact real change.

Homeless at Home
Today, the United Nations estimates that 77 million people – more than 1% of the world’s population – are displaced within their own countries, having been forced to flee their homes by armed conflicts, violence, urbanization, development, and natural disasters.
This is more than the population of France, the United Kingdom, or Turkey.
These people are not “refugees,” because they have not crossed an international border, but their experiences are often equally devastating.
Today, the number of people who have been internally displaced by conflicts alone is twice that of refugees. With the increasing pattern of internal, rather than international, armed conflicts, and the rising regularity of extreme weather events affecting millions of people, internal displacement poses an even greater challenge to future generations.
Uprooted from their homes and livelihoods, and traumatized by the violence or sudden disaster that forced them to flee, the displaced are often thrust into an extremely precarious future with few resources.
Think of the 15 million Chinese displaced following the Sichuan earthquake, the more than two million Iraqis uprooted within their country’s borders by sectarian and other violence, the 2.4 million displaced in Darfur, or the hundreds of thousands who have fled Mogadishu in the last year.
In the last decade, those displaced by conflicts alone rose from 19 million to 26 million, with millions more displaced by disasters.
The plight of these victims long went unrecognized, as governments and the international community alike failed to acknowledge their rights to protection and assistance.
In 1998, the UN issued Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which sets out these legal rights.
Ten years on, what impact have the Principles had on displaced people’s lives? The achievements are notable, if insufficient.
We have raised awareness of the plight of the displaced, brought about changes in government policies, and raised billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs. This has helped save countless lives.
Humanitarian efforts continue to be strengthened, including through a new rapid funding mechanism, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund.
But for every gain we have made, enormous difficulties still remain.
The number of those displaced by natural disasters is rising, as the adverse effects of climate change continue to mount.
Nine of every ten recorded disasters are now climate-related.
As many as 50 million people around the world are estimated to be displaced each year by floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and landslides.
However sudden the initial displacement, the impact can last for generations, together with a long-term need for clean water, shelter, health care, and other basic services, as victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998 know from bitter experience.
Nor are rich countries immune.
Two years after Hurricane Katrina, thousands of people remain in temporary shelters.
Moreover, violent armed groups, be they government-supported militias or rebel movements, increasingly embrace terror as a tactic to force civilians from their homes, as seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Iraq, and elsewhere.
Millions of people remain impoverished, face discrimination, and suffer long-lasting trauma even after the guns fall silent.
Life in camps is demoralizing and ultimately dehumanizing.
The world rightly focuses on the tragedy in Darfur, but overlooks another four million Sudanese still displaced as a result of the north-south conflict, many of whom continue to live in terrible poverty in Khartoum slums or in makeshift camps across the country, with little opportunity to re-build their lives.
We must prevent displacement from occurring, and end it as quickly as possible.
On the preventive front, countless lives can be saved by simple actions such as flood-proofing coastlines, or strengthening earthquake codes for hospitals and schools.
Countries like Bangladesh and Mozambique have proven that disaster risk reduction and preparedness can be a life-saving investment.
In conflict situations, preventing displacement primarily requires political will.
Those who forcibly displace civilians in violation of international law must be held accountable in order to deter others in the future.
States that are not involved in the conflict are also required to uphold the rights of the displaced, including the right to return to their homes wherever possible, and this must be addressed in peace agreements and enforced in peacekeeping mandates.
So here’s the bottom line: conflicts will continue and natural disasters are growing in frequency and intensity.
Addressing the root causes and reducing the impact of displacement should start by heeding victims’ voices – their needs and wishes must be understood and their rights respected.
The international community can help. But national authorities must lead.
Ten years after the Guiding Principles were signed, the time for excuses and inaction has run out.

How to Fail to Recover
NEW YORK – Some people thought that Barack Obama’s election would turn everything around for America.
Because it has not, even after the passage of a huge stimulus bill, the presentation of a new program to deal with the underlying housing problem, and several plans to stabilize the financial system, some are even beginning to blame Obama and his team.
Obama, however, inherited an economy in freefall, and could not possibly have turned things around in the short time since his inauguration.
President Bush seemed like a deer caught in the headlights –�paralyzed, unable to do almost anything – for months before he left office.
It is a relief that the US finally has a president who can act, and what he has been doing will make a big difference.
Unfortunately, what he is doing is not enough.
The stimulus package appears big – more than 2% of GDP per year – but one-third of it goes to tax cuts.
And, with Americans facing a debt overhang, rapidly increasing unemployment (and the worst unemployment compensation system among major industrial countries), and falling asset prices, they are likely to save much of the tax cut.
Almost half of the stimulus simply offsets the contractionary effect of cutbacks at the state level.
America’s 50 states must maintain balanced budgets.
The total shortfalls were estimated at $150 billion a few months ago; now the number must be much larger – indeed, California alone faces a shortfall of $40 billion.
Household savings are finally beginning to rise, which is good for the long-run health of household finances, but disastrous for economic growth.
Meanwhile, investment and exports are plummeting as well.
America’s automatic stabilizers –�the progressivity of our tax systems, the strength of our welfare system – have been greatly weakened, but they will provide some stimulus, as the expected fiscal deficit soars to 10% of GDP.
In short, the stimulus will strengthen America’s economy, but it is probably not enough to restore robust growth.
This is bad news for the rest of the world, too, for a strong global recovery requires a strong American economy.
The real failings in the Obama recovery program, however, lie not in the stimulus package but in its efforts to revive financial markets.
America’s failures provide important lessons to countries around the world, which are or will be facing increasing problems with their banks:
- Delaying bank restructuring is costly, in terms of both the eventual bailout costs and the damage to the overall economy in the interim.
- Governments do not like to admit the full costs of the problem, so they give the banking system just enough to survive, but not enough to return it to health.
- Confidence is important, but it must rest on sound fundamentals.
Policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were made, and that the business acumen of financial-market leaders and regulators will be validated once confidence is restored.
- Bankers can be expected to act in their self-interest on the basis of incentives.
Perverse incentives fueled excessive risk-taking, and banks that are near collapse but are too big to fail will engage in even more of it.
Knowing that the government will pick up the pieces if necessary, they will postpone resolving mortgages and pay out billions in bonuses and dividends.
- Socializing losses while privatizing gains is more worrisome than the consequences of nationalizing banks.
American taxpayers are getting an increasingly bad deal.
In the first round of cash infusions, they got about $0.67 in assets for every dollar they gave (though the assets were almost surely overvalued, and quickly fell in value).
But in the recent cash infusions, it is estimated that Americans are getting $0.25, or less, for every dollar.
Bad terms mean a large national debt in the future. One reason we may be getting bad terms is that if we got fair value for our money, we would by now be the dominant shareholder in at least one of the major banks.
- Don’t confuse saving bankers and shareholders with saving banks.
America could have saved its banks, but let the shareholders go, for far less than it has spent.
- Trickle-down economics almost never works.
Throwing money at banks hasn’t helped homeowners: foreclosures continue to increase.
Letting AIG fail might have hurt some systemically important institutions, but dealing with that would have been better than to gamble upwards of $150 billion and hope that some of it might stick where it is important.
- Lack of transparency got the US financial system into this trouble.
Lack of transparency will not get it out.
The Obama administration is promising to pick up losses to persuade hedge funds and other private investors to buy out banks’ bad assets.
But this will not establish “market prices,” as the administration claims.
With the government bearing losses, these are distorted prices. Bank losses have already occurred, and their gains must now come at taxpayers’ expense.
Bringing in hedge funds as third parties will simply increase the cost.
- Better to be forward looking than backward looking, focusing on reducing the risk of new loans and ensuring that funds create new lending capacity. Bygone are bygones. As a point of reference, $700 billion provided to a new bank, leveraged 10 to 1, could have financed $7 trillion of new loans.
The era of believing that something can be created out of nothing should be over.
Short-sighted responses by politicians – who hope to get by with a deal that is small enough to please taxpayers and large enough to please the banks – will only prolong the problem.
An impasse is looming.
More money will be needed, but Americans are in no mood to provide it – certainly not on the terms that have been seen so far.
The well of money may be running dry, and so, too, may be America’s legendary optimism and hope.

The Birth Pains of Arab States
TEL AVIV – Caught off guard by the unraveling of the Iraqi state – spurred by the rapid advance of militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) – Americans and Europeans have reverted to their penchant for self-flagellation.
And, indeed, a major share of the responsibility for the tumult in Iraq – not to mention Syria – undoubtedly lies with the West’s pernicious colonial legacy and wrongheaded policies in the Arab Middle East.
But, ultimately, the turmoil in the Arab world reflects the difficult encounter of an old civilization with the challenges of modernity.
To be sure, US President George W. Bush’s Iraqi enterprise was calamitously ill-conceived, as was President Barack Obama’s subsequent failure to leave an adequate residual force in Iraq after the United States withdrew its troops.
Indeed, America’s hasty departure allowed ISIS to gain ground, while blurring the border with Syria.
In its push to carve out an Islamic state, ISIS invaded Syria from Mosul long before they invaded Mosul from Syria.
But history is frequently shaped by overwhelming impersonal forces – such as religion, ethnic identity, and cultural attitudes – that are not receptive to solutions based on force, let alone intervention by foreign armies.
Even if the US never invaded Iraq, it is not far-fetched to assume that the transition from Saddam Hussein’s leadership would have been violent, with an outcome resembling either Syria today or Yugoslavia in the 1990s, when a brutal civil war ended in the country’s division along ethnic lines.
In his famous attack on determinism, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin did not deny that structural factors could be a driver of history; he simply rejected their use as a pretext for avoiding moral responsibility.
Though Arab elites could not control, say, the forces of Western imperialism, their failure to acknowledge their share of responsibility for the problems plaguing modern Arab societies amounts to a betrayal of their peoples.
Today, the Arab predicament is, at its core, a crisis of the concept of the Arab state.
Arabs have long denigrated Israel’s ethnic concept of nationalism, arguing that religion is not a legitimate basis for statehood – as if European countries did not begin as and remain Christian republics for centuries, and as if the Arab countries surrounding Israel were a monument to religious and ethnic diversity.
In fact, Arab countries are imploding precisely because of their incapacity to reconcile such diversity.
Of course, that struggle is not unique to Arab countries.
For Europe, creating a peaceful, quasi-federal union required two world wars and the redrawing of national boundaries through ethnic cleansing – and it continues to be challenged by xenophobic and nationalist movements.
Likewise, Yugoslavia’s multi-ethnic experiment ended violently, following the collapse of its dictatorship.
The Arab world’s struggle to create a viable sociopolitical order will not be any easier.
Indeed, Syria and Iraq – now composed of separate Kurdish, Shia, and Sunni quasi-states, with the latter extending into Syria – might not be the last countries in the region to face challenges to the arbitrary borders established in the region by colonial powers at the end of World War I.
The Arab Spring revolutions are not just about the new Arab generation’s yearning for democracy, which still remains mostly unfulfilled; they are now mainly about the long-simmering frustration of minorities that were neglected in the post-colonial era and repressed by autocrats seeking to impose unity on multi-ethnic societies.
Today, the Middle East is experiencing the collapse of the notion that Arab states can accommodate religiously diverse societies.
This is not a problem that a foreign power can resolve.
The mistake that the US has made in the Middle East has been to attempt to cut short the maturation process that major historical changes demand.
Indeed, by invading Iraq, the US was effectively trying to circumvent the logic of the historical cycle.
If Europe had to endure centuries of religious wars and two successive world wars to settle its national and ethnic disputes, how could the US expect to be able to export democracy and respect for minorities to the Middle East on the wings of F-16s?
It is telling that the two most successful democratic transitions in the Arab world in recent years – Tunisia and Kurdistan – occurred with minimal meddling from the West.
The future of the Arab Middle East is in the hands of its peoples – and history does not allow for shortcuts.
Like all other civilizations in history, the Arabs must engage in a long process of trial and error aimed at overcoming their structural challenges – a process that is likely to extend throughout much of the twenty-first century.
However pernicious Western policies might have been, Islamist forces are a natural outcome in Arab lands, a genuine response to the failures of secular Arab nationalism and the modern Arab state.
This is not to say that the West cannot offer any assistance.
But it must do so with humility and cultural sensitivity, using smart diplomacy instead of “counter-terrorist strikes.”

Soft Power and the Struggle Against Terrorism
Last year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, asked Secretary of State Colin Powell why the United States seemed to focus only on its hard power rather than its soft power.
Secretary Powell replied that the US had used hard power to win World War II, but he continued: "What followed immediately after hard power?
Did the US ask for dominion over a single nation in Europe?
No.
Soft power came in the Marshall Plan¼.We did the same thing in Japan."
After the war in Iraq ended, I spoke about soft power (a concept I developed) to a conference co-sponsored by the US Army in Washington.
One speaker was Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
According to a press account, "the top military brass listened sympathetically," but when someone asked Rumsfeld for his opinion on soft power, he replied, "I don't know what it means."
One of Rumsfeld's "rules" is that "weakness is provocative."
He is correct, up to a point.
As Osama bin Laden observed, people like a strong horse.
But power, defined as the ability to influence others, comes in many guises, and soft power is not weakness.
On the contrary, it is the failure to use soft power effectively that weakens America in the struggle against terrorism.
Soft power is the ability to get what one wants by attracting others rather than threatening or paying them.
It is based on culture, political ideals, and policies.
When you persuade others to want what you want, you do not have to spend as much on sticks and carrots to move them in your direction.
Hard power, which relies on coercion, grows out of military and economic might.
It remains crucial in a world populated by threatening states and terrorist organizations.
But soft power will become increasingly important in preventing terrorists from recruiting new supporters, and for obtaining the international cooperation necessary for countering terrorism.
The US is more powerful than any country since the Roman Empire, but like Rome, America is neither invincible nor invulnerable.
Rome did not succumb to the rise of another empire, but to the onslaught of waves of barbarians.
Modern high-tech terrorists are the new barbarians.
The US cannot alone hunt down every suspected Al Qaeda leader.
Nor can it launch a war whenever it wishes without alienating other countries.
The four-week war in Iraq was a dazzling display of America's hard military power that removed a vicious tyrant.
But it did not remove America's vulnerability to terrorism.
It was also costly in terms of our soft power to attract others.
In the aftermath of the war, polls showed a dramatic decline in the popularity of the US even in countries like Britain, Spain, and Italy, whose governments supported the war.
America's standing plummeted in Islamic countries, whose support is needed to help track the flow of terrorists, tainted money, and dangerous weapons.
The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations - Islam versus the West - but a civil war within Islamic civilization between extremists who use violence to enforce their vision and a moderate majority who want things like jobs, education, health care, and dignity as they pursue their faith.
America will not win unless the moderates win.
American soft power will never attract Osama bin Laden and the extremists.
Only hard power can deal with them.
But soft power will play a crucial role in attracting moderates and denying the extremists new recruits.
During the Cold War, the West's strategy of containment combined the hard power of military deterrence with the soft power of attracting people behind the Iron Curtain.
Behind the wall of military containment, the West ate away Soviet self-confidence with broadcasts, student and cultural exchanges, and the success of capitalist economics.
As a former KGB official later testified, "Exchanges were a Trojan horse for the Soviet Union.
They played a tremendous role in the erosion of the Soviet system."
In retirement, President Dwight Eisenhower said that he should have taken money out of the defense budget to strengthen the US Information Agency.
With the Cold War's end, Americans became more interested in budget savings than in investing in soft power.
In 2003, a bipartisan advisory group reported that the US was spending only $150 million on public diplomacy in Muslim countries, an amount it called grossly inadequate.
Indeed, the combined cost for the State Department's public diplomacy programs and all of America's international broadcasting is just over $1 billion, about the same amount spent by Britain or France, countries that are one-fifth America's size and whose military budgets are only 25% as large.
No one would suggest that America spend as much to launch ideas as to launch bombs, but it does seem odd that the US spends 400 times as much on hard power as on soft power.
If the US spent just 1% of the military budget on soft power, it would quadruple its current spending on this key component of the war on terrorism.
If America is to win that war, its leaders are going to have to do better at combining soft and hard power into "smart power."

The Digital Money Revolution
LONDON – How radically will digital currencies change our methods of exchange and the way that we think about money?
With innovation in digital payments barreling ahead, these questions are now commanding the attention of the World Economic Forum and other international institutions.
Regardless of how Facebook’s own digital-currency moonshot, Libra, fares, it has already provided a wake-up call for firms and policymakers around the world.
“If revolution there is to be, let us rather undertake it than undergo it,” Otto von Bismarck once said.
The question for policymakers is not whether to try to shape the digital-money revolution, but how.
Digital money is already a key battleground in finance, with technology firms, payment processing companies, and banks all vying to become the gateway into the burgeoning platform-based economy.
The prizes that await the winners could be huge.
In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay already control more than 90% of all mobile payments.
And in the last three years, the four largest listed payment firms – Visa, Mastercard, Amex, and PayPal – have increased in value by more than the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google).
In a way, Libra is actually crashing the party late.
The opportunities offered by digital money are clear.
Across Western countries, moving money is overly costly and inefficient, and those who end up paying the most are often the ones who can least afford to do so.
As I argued in a report for the Bank of England (BOE) earlier this year, improving these processes could yield significant returns and social benefits.
Moreover, the needs – the potential returns – are even greater in many emerging markets, particularly when it comes to cross-border payments.
According to the World Bank, the cost of sending international peer-to-peer remittances averages around 7% of the sum.
Efforts to improve the main payment channels are ongoing.
TransferWise, for example, claims to have reduced the average cost of cross-border transfers for its clients to 0.74%.
But less well-trodden routes remain a challenge, owing to the hurdles posed by anti-money-laundering rules and poor data quality.
Given the concerns that Libra has raised, some central banks have begun to explore the option of issuing their own digital tokens.
Others are studying the thorny legal and regulatory challenges posed by digital money, so that they can safeguard monetary and financial stability.
For her part, Lael Brainard, a governor on the US Federal Reserve Board, recently suggested that the risks of cryptocurrencies outweigh the benefits.
By contrast, the People’s Bank of China is forging ahead – though not toward the decentralized or “permissionless” blockchain model envisioned by crypto enthusiasts.
The PBOC wants to use cryptography to issue tokens to mainstream banks, which will then be passed on to customers within the existing two-tiered banking system.
Hence, if the European Central Bank (or others) wanted to be the first central bank to issue digital money, the opportunity is there for the taking.
To policymakers considering the options presented by digital money, I would offer five recommendations from my BOE report.
First, monetary authorities should create the infrastructure to enable alternative payment methods to connect to one another.
The private sector can flourish when central banks act as a platform for innovation, as BOE Governor Mark Carney has shown by granting non-bank payment firms access to the BOE payments system.
But success will depend on how easily new providers can access the central-bank infrastructure, which will require well-designed application programming interfaces through which to receive and share information.
Second, policymakers should usher in the next generation of payments regulation.
Rules need to be updated to reflect the increasing complexity and shifting risks of the current system.
As the cost of payments falls, the value of data will grow.
Yet existing rules pertaining to data sharing, security, and liability are mostly rudimentary.
Given the flurry of new entrants, there is a case to be made for tiering regulation – as the Singaporeans have done – and stress-testing payment firms for their financial resilience and cyber-security protections.
Third, governments need to champion better digital identification, which is essential to improving financial inclusion, curbing cyber fraud, and reducing costs.
Some countries have already made impressive progress on this front.
India, for example, has largely cracked the identification problem with its Aadhaar program, which dramatically simplifies the process through which networks can know their customers.
Countries that do not have a tradition of issuing national ID cards have more work to do, but their governments can cooperate with the private sector, or use existing high-quality national data sets such as passport and tax numbers.
Fourth, all countries need to support stronger messaging standards to improve cross-border payments, reduce costs, and prevent fraud.
Just as postal codes help mail get to the right place, so too could better tagging of payment senders and recipients.
Fifth, and critically, policymakers need to create a roadmap for the decline of cash.
In Sweden, cash payments have fallen by 80% over the past decade, and many other developed markets are just 5-10 years behind.
Digital payments bring many benefits, but the Swedish experience shows that without a coordinated plan, the pace of change risks excluding some groups in society.
As payment habits shift, each country will need a strategy to improve its payments infrastructure – including broadband and mobile-telephony networks – so that no one is left behind.
Payments innovation is moving at a dizzying pace.
Some ideas may fail to get off the ground, while others may need to pivot to become commercially viable.
Other issues, like market dominance or cyber-security risks, will undoubtedly become more prominent in policy debates.
On balance, however, the economic and social benefits of a frictionless, fraud-free, and trusted global payments system will likely outweigh the risks.

Let A Thousand Growth Models Bloom
Over recent decades a simplistic view about the fundamentals that govern the theory and practice of development has taken root.
Stated nakedly, this view holds that growth requires two things: foreign technology and good institutions.
Failure to grow can be attributed to either (or both) of two pathologies.
Call one the "protection" pathology, in which governments stymie progress by reducing access to foreign investment and technology.
The other pathology is "corruption," where political leaders fail to respect property rights and the rule of law.
The natural remedies for these pathologies are claimed to be economic openness and improved governance.
Reforms focused on governance and openness thus became the cornerstones of development strategy in virtually every country during the last fifteen years.
Experience presents an awkward fit (at best) with this conception.
Consider Latin America, where there has been greater enthusiasm for the so-called "Washington Consensus" on growth than in any other corner of the world.
By the standards of the consensus view, policymaking in Latin America was better in the 1990s than ever before, nonetheless few countries in the region grew faster than in the period before 1980.
Or consider more successful countries.
Some of the most important - South Korea and Taiwan since the early 1960s, China since the late 1970s, India since the early 1980s - have done extremely well under heterodox arrangements.
All emphasized exports; none grossly violated property rights.
Their strategies bear only passing similarity to today's consensus.
South Korea and Taiwan retained high levels of protection for a long time, and made active use of industrial policies.
China's reforms are marked by partial liberalization, two-track pricing, limited deregulation, financial restraint, an unorthodox legal regime, and the absence of clear private property rights.
India barely reformed its cumbersome trade and industrial regime before its economy took off in the 1980s.
These and other success stories share one thing: they are instances of growth strategies that combine orthodoxy with local heresies - unconventional institutional innovations that relax constraints on growth at least cost to the social and political fabric.
Of course, heterodoxy does not always produce payoffs.
Most countries with protected economies and lax protection of property rights languish.
But the fact that some of the world's most successful economies prospered while doing things that are not in the rule-book is something that cannot be dismissed easily.
To grasp the conventional view's deficiencies, begin with the problem of technology adoption.
Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge.
Neither economic nor management theory is of much help in helping entrepreneurs (or the state) choose appropriate investments among the range of modern-sector activities.
Yet making the right investment decisions is essential to growth, because they determine the pattern of specialization.
Today's intellectual property regime protects innovators in advanced countries by issuing temporary monopolies, i.e., patents.
But the investor in the developing country who figures out that an existing good can be produced profitably at home and sets up a model for others to emulate does not normally get such protection, even though the social returns can be high.
Laissez-faire is not the optimal solution here, just as it is not in the case of research and development of new products.
Desirable government policy consists of a carrots and stick: encouraging investment and entrepreneurship in the modern sector ex ante, but, equally important, rationalizing production and driving out poor performers ex post.
Institutional arrangements also have large elements of specificity.
Discovering which institutions are suitable to local conditions requires experimentation.
Reforms that succeed in one setting may do poorly or fail in other settings.
Two-track reform worked well in Deng's China but not in Gorbachev's Soviet Union.
Import-substitution fostered competitive industries in Brazil, but not in Argentina.
Gradualism may be appropriate to India, not Chile.
Specificity helps explain why successful countries -China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Chile among others - usually combine unorthodox elements with orthodox policies.
It may also account for why important institutional differences persist among advanced countries in areas such as the public sector's role, the nature of legal systems, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance mechanisms.
It is not that economic principles work differently in different places, or need to be tailored to local conditions.
An important distinction between economic principles and their institutional embodiment is that most key economic principles are institution-free.
Incentives, competition, hard-budget constraints, sound money, fiscal sustainability, property rights are central to the ways in which economists think about policy and its reform.
But these principles do not demand specific institutional solutions.
Property rights can be implemented through common law, civil law, or, for that matter, Chinese-style socialism.
Competition can be maintained by a combination of free entry and laissez-faire, or by a well-functioning regulatory authority.
Macroeconomic stability can be achieved under a variety of fiscal institutions.
Because policymakers operate in second-best environments, optimal reform trajectories - even in apparently straightforward cases such as price reform - cannot be designed without due regard to prevailing conditions and without weighing the consequences for multiple distorted margins.
Neither technology nor good institutions can be acquired without significant domestic adaptations.
Those adaptations require a pro-active role for the state and civil society, and collaborative strategies that foster entrepreneurship and institution building.
What the world needs right now is less consensus and more experimentation in the service of such strategies.

A Better Future for the Congo
LONDON – The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has become synonymous with state failure.
No country has endured more brutal conflicts, hosted more kleptocratic and corrupt governments, or squandered more resource wealth.
Trapped in a cycle of political uncertainty, economic recession, and escalating violence, humanitarian disaster has become a way of life.
Yet a better future is possible.
At the ramshackle Rubaya primary school, in a small town in the lush green hills of North Kivu province, bordering Rwanda, one gets a glimpse of that possibility.
Children sit attentively in overcrowded classrooms, with enthusiasm, ambition, and hope lighting up their faces.
Dorothy Gakoti, aged 13, wants to become a nurse.
“If I succeed in school, I can have a better life with more opportunity – and I can help my family and community,” she declares.
Yet the DRC – including North Kivu – remains beset with challenges.
Dozens of ethnically based armed groups called Mai-Mai prey on local populations.
Sexual violence, often targeting young girls, is as endemic as it is under-reported.
Some 4.5 million children are malnourished, almost half of them severely.
Less than half of the children who contract potentially deadly diseases like pneumonia and malaria receive treatment.
Making matters worse, about one-quarter of the DRC’s school-age children are not receiving any education at all.
And those who do go to school face abysmal learning outcomes: Dorothy doesn’t have a book or pencil to her name, and she struggles to understand French, the language of instruction.
Yet writing off the DRC as a development failure would be a mistake.
Since the end of a devastating five-year war in 2003, the country has made marked gains.
While two-thirds of its people still survive on less than $1.25 per day, poverty and child mortality have fallen, while rates of immunization and school enrollment are rising.
Moreover, the DRC has vast untapped economic potential.
It possesses over half of the world’s known reserves of cobalt (a key component in computer chips and lithium-ion batteries) and around 80% of the world’s supply of coltan (a heat-resistant metal used in mobile phones and other devices).
The country is also a major producer of copper, gold, tin, tungsten, and diamonds.
Add to that fertile soils and some of the world’s greatest hydro-power potential, and the DRC should be a regional, if not continental, economic powerhouse.
What explains the disconnect between the DRC’s vast economic potential and the condition of its children?
For starters, the government has failed to create a tax system to mobilize resources for public investment in health and education.
In fact, the DRC has one of the world’s lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios, with foreign actors and local vested interests effectively pillaging the country.
In his novel Heart of Darkness, set in the DRC, Joseph Conrad wrote about what he later described as “the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience.”
Yet even Conrad would have been aghast at the windfall gains and rock-bottom tax rates that foreign mining investors have secured over the last decade.
Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have criticized the excessive generosity of the deals provided for foreign investors in mining, despite having designed and pushed them.
The US Treasury Department has accused one foreign investor of gaining $1.3 billion – more than five times total government health financing in the DRC – through “opaque and corrupt” deals.
The lack of government revenue is directly reflected in under-investment in public services.
Parents seeking treatment for a malaria-stricken child, or a place for that child in school, must pay from their own pocket – an impossibility for many.
As crowded as the Rubaya primary school’s classrooms are, every child I spoke to there had a sibling not attending school, because their family couldn’t cover the fees – around $10 per term.
Political turbulence has further disrupted development efforts.
The election that President Joseph Kabila was supposed to have called in 2016 is now scheduled for December 2018 – a delay that has intensified grievances and spurred violence.
Last year, some two million people in the DRC, half of them in the previously peaceful central province of Kasai, were forced to flee their homes.
The total number of internally displaced people now stands at 4.5 million – second only to Syria in current conflicts – while another 750,000 have fled to neighboring countries.
These displaced people and refugees are living in desperate conditions, without adequate shelter, nutrition, and health care, and with virtually no access to education.
Boosting productivity and creating jobs for the more than 1.5 million workers entering the labor market each year are essential to put the DRC on a different, more hopeful path.
Here, education is critical.
Each additional year of schooling is associated with a 9% increase in income.
Expanded opportunities for learning would thus go a long way toward reducing poverty, especially given that almost half of the DRC’s population is under 15 years of age.
But improved access to education must go hand in hand with strategies to combat child malnutrition and poor health.
Education for all and universal health provision hold the key to a better future for DRC’s children.
Progress will require the next government to take urgent action to build a tax base.
More immediately, unless an effective response to the DRC’s escalating humanitarian crisis is mounted this year, the level of suffering will be immense – and not just in the country itself.
As neighboring countries know all too well, what happens in the DRC often doesn’t stay in the DRC.
An emergency summit planned for this week in Geneva is an opportunity for donors to stave off the worst, by providing the $1.7 billion the United Nations estimates an effective response will require.
That will require donors to abandon their short-sighted and wrong-headed perceptions of the DRC as a lost cause, and instead help the country build the future that its children deserve.

How France Will Reform
PARIS – The world is changing rapidly – and it will not wait for anyone.
The only way to thrive is to keep pace with this transformation.
That is why France is pursuing reforms.
Of course, reform means change.
But it does not mean giving in to external pressure, or giving up what makes France French.
Rather, it is the key to consolidating our history, our pride, our traditions, our way of life, and our values in a dynamic global environment, for the sake of today’s citizens and tomorrow’s.
It is the key to building a stronger, more prosperous France.
Clearly, much is at stake in the ongoing reform process.
The good news is that many factors work in France’s favor, including diverse geography, a vibrant science and technology sector, a rich culture, and vast human capital.
Indeed, these factors help to explain why France remains the world’s fifth-largest economy.
But, as globalization transforms the world economy, France must adapt in order to enable its businesses to compete abroad as well as at home.
A robust business sector is decisive in an open economy, as it shapes a country’s ability to preserve – and improve – its citizens’ living standards.
That is why everything possible must be done to enable France to create more and better wealth.
By helping French businesses recover lost margins, we can empower them to invest and create employment.
That is precisely what the “responsibility pact,” which came into force on January 1, and the tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs aim to do.
As we help French businesses to expand abroad, we must also work to encourage inward foreign investment.
Both are key to a country’s commercial attractiveness – among the most important dimensions of global competition.
This stronger France will tackle whatever challenges the world throws at it head on.
At the same time, it will demonstrate its capacity to eliminate drags on creativity and wealth creation.
The “law on growth and activity” that will be voted on this year will unleash the business sector’s energy, including by stimulating competition.
Moreover, opening up regulated professions will help to reduce the inequalities with which the French public has become increasingly frustrated.
To create more wealth in an open economy is one of my government’s priorities.
But more wealth alone will not cure France’s ills.
The most successful countries are those where employers and employees feel bound to a common fate.
It is thus urgent to improve social dialogue and bolster trust in France.
This objective underlies our “simplification schemes” for negotiation and consultation in the business sector.
And it is helping to guide vocational education and training reform, which will benefit not only those who wish to enhance their skills at work, but also those whose lack of training is preventing them from finding employment.
These initiatives are just part of a broader shift.
Through a variety of mechanisms, we are working to make citizens’ lives easier, streamline business activities, and relieve the authorities of extraneous work that diverts attention from important strategic tasks.
French citizens will soon begin to feel the impact of these efforts in their daily lives.
Despite the tremendous potential of these initiatives, they will be for naught if they are not perceived as being fair.
France, after all, has long been defined by a strong egalitarian impulse.
Consider education.
In reworking our “priority education” program, we can adjust teaching methods to address school inequalities, while channeling additional resources to disadvantaged areas.
This includes ensuring that all schools have enough computers, so that all students can benefit from today’s technological breakthroughs, with no digital divide among students or regions.
The fact that the impact will not be felt for years should not be allowed to diminish its urgency.
Indeed, the entire process of building a strong and equitable economy should aim not just to improve citizens’ lives today; it must also prepare France for the future.
And, when it comes to boosting a country’s long-term prospects, the most successful initiatives often take time to produce visible results.
In a society that overvalues immediacy, it can be difficult to take a long-term view.
But my government will not be deterred from forward-thinking action that will ensure that tomorrow’s France is the France our citizens want and deserve.
It is up to the state to set an example for reform.
This is all the more true in France, where citizens place high expectations on the state – not to do everything, but certainly to draw strategic lines and enable local actors to succeed.
In short, the government must put its agenda-setting power at the service of the people.
When it comes to preparing for the future, one exceptionally large project lies ahead: the energy transition.
We all know that we are headed toward a new growth model – one that is more sober and sustainable, that depends less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy sources.
This new approach to growth will entail new habits, new attitudes, and new modes of living.
With the energy transition law, my government aims to get ahead of this trend by creating the legislative framework for future “green” growth.
The goals of the French government’s reform agenda are clear: A stronger France, able to thrive in a rapidly changing global environment; a fairer France, without which no effort, whether individual or collective, could be considered a success; and a more steadfast France that can serve as a stable and prosperous home for our children.
In the interest of France and its people, we are committed to the reforms needed to realize this vision.

The Elusive Search for Global Financial Rules
BRUSSELS – If the financial crisis is global, it is said, then the solution must be global : an international financial system that works better.
And, because the Bretton Woods institutions (BWIs) – the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund – form the center of the international financial system, they must be included in the solution.
An enhanced international financial system must pursue two main lines of action.
The first is to broaden the scope of international cooperation.
At the moment, the Financial Stability Board, whose members include the G-20 countries, mainly pursues initiatives in this field.
A second line of action is to strengthen the international institutions’ soft powers to aim for more consistent economic policies, especially by systemically important economies.
This would directly involve the Bretton Woods institutions, notably the IMF.
A strengthening of the IMF was agreed after the Asian crisis in the 1990’s, and the G-7 summit in Cologne in 1999 mandated the Fund to play a strong surveillance role to ensure greater transparency and encourage early adjustment by countries with unsustainable balance-of-payments positions.
But, over the last decade, the expectations raised by this mandate have not been met.
Some emerging economies did not let their currencies float but, instead, continued to peg them at undervalued exchange rates in order to promote their exports and build up reserves as a form of insurance in case of crisis.
Moreover, the IMF has not succeeded in convincing countries to pursue macroeconomic policies consistent with sustainable current-account positions.
Nor have advanced economies, particularly the United States, taken IMF advice fully into consideration.
The accumulation of large surpluses, especially in emerging Asian economies and oil-exporting countries, enabled the US to finance its current-account deficit.
It also lowered long-term interest rates in the US and made monetary conditions there more expansionary.
Emerging economies, following the advanced countries, also attached less importance to Fund surveillance, especially as their accumulation of external assets made them less dependent on IMF financing and advice.
For example, the Fund has been unable to complete a surveillance program with China for three years.
All this occurred against the background of emerging-market economies’ claims that their relatively low representation in the BWIs denied the IMF legitimacy.
In recent months, the Fund played an important role in resolving the crisis, in particular by assessing the gravity of the situation and providing countries with external finance. But, if we are to create an international monetary system in which crises are the exception, the Fund must play a greater preventive role.
There seems to be a sense of denial in several countries that large external imbalances were a cause of the crisis.
These imbalances ultimately reflected the accumulation of excessive international liquidity by countries like the US, stemming from excessive savings by countries like China.
This spurred an unsustainable consumption boom, as well as unwarranted risk-taking by consumers and financial institutions, which contributed to the large distortions and bubbles in global financial markets that were the preconditions for the current crisis.
The risk now is that the forces favoring earlier and effective adjustment of imbalances have been weakened.
Indeed, few today are calling for the IMF to play a stronger role in preventing the accumulation of excessive external imbalances and in fostering more disciplined domestic policies.
An example of this is the way the IMF’s Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members’ Policies, aimed at identifying fundamental exchange-rate misalignments, was modified to allow greater discretion in surveillance, especially over exchange rates.
This might look like a tactical choice, but I doubt that it will result in a stronger hand for the IMF.
Emerging and developing countries are demanding a stronger voice in the IMF, but they also seem to be suggesting that they would like it to be less intrusive and less able to impose conditionality – while simultaneously providing more and cheaper financing.
This might be appropriate in times of systemic crisis, but it is not sustainable in normal times.
Indeed, some thought should be given to an exit strategy from cheap and unconditional IMF financing.
Instead, most IMF shareholders seem to favor making the organization’s financing easier.
Enhancing the role of its Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), or supplementing the dollar with another world reserve currency, would help facilitate the financing needs of both deficit and surplus countries.
For deficit countries, borrowing from international institutions outside the markets would be easier, giving the issuer of such currency some form of international lender-of-last-resort function.
For surplus countries that want to accumulate reserves, it would reduce exchange-rate risk.
But, if financing were to become easier, it would be unclear how both creditors and debtors would perceive the risk of excessive imbalances.
The real danger is that adjustment would take place even later, with imbalances left to accumulate for a longer period of time.
Under these circumstances, crises could be even greater, and the adjustments harsher – as occurred under the last world currency, the gold standard.
A viable international financial system requires a mechanism to keep imbalances in check.
An essential element of such a mechanism is to give the IMF a prominent role in two areas: strong and effective surveillance in order to prevent crises, and responsible lending to countries in need, but with appropriate limits and conditionality.
We don’t need to reinvent the wheel; we just need to follow up on the commitments made ten years ago.
Dealing with the short-run challenges of the current crisis should not distract us from the objective of preventing future meltdowns.

Why Subsidies Beat Lockdowns
BERLIN – Many European governments are trying to combat the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic by imposing a “lockdown light,” usually including limitations on the operations of restaurants, bars, and some non-essential shops.
The assumption behind these partial closures is that the risk of infection is high when people mingle in closed spaces.
A recent paper published in Nature provides further evidence that places like restaurants, gyms, and cafes can play a major role in spreading the coronavirus.
The mandated closures have led to strong popular protests (especially in France and Italy), because they threaten many small shop and restaurant owners’ livelihoods.
These sectors were already under pressure from e-commerce before the pandemic, and many marginal operators fear they cannot survive even a light second lockdown.
Governments have been trying to help by compensating them for lost income.
But in many cases the compensation has been late, partial, and difficult to target at the most economically vulnerable.
Yet, governments might not need to resort to mandated closures if they consider the alternative of taxes or subsidies.
Such fiscal measures have so far played no role in so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight the pandemic, even though they could achieve the same social-distancing goals.
In concrete terms, the government could announce a subsidy to any store or restaurant owner willing to close their establishment for a certain period (say, 1-3 months).
A longer closure would be better because it would help to keep COVID-19 infections low during the remainder of the winter.
Once a large proportion of stores have closed, policymakers would need to prevent the remainder from becoming more crowded.
But they already regulated overcrowding prior to the new second-wave restrictions by asking customers to keep a minimum distance from one another.
This type of regulation should be maintained in the simplest form possible, by requiring a minimum number of square meters of space per customer.
The government could thus start by specifying a subsidy in terms of a lump sum per square meter, paid up front to the owner of any establishment prepared to close (for in-store shopping or dining) for a number of months.
Takeaway services and online sales would still be permitted.
Operators would then calculate their opportunities from other sales channels.
For those least able to adapt, accepting the subsidy might be the best option.
In principle, it would be preferable to conduct a reverse auction under which retailers submit the price at which they would be willing to close.
The government could then hold successive rounds until it achieved the desired reduction in retail space.
But there might simply not be enough time to organize this now.
A similar discrepancy between social and private interests exists with regard to climate change.
Most economists recognize that a Pigovian tax on greenhouse-gas emissions – named after the British economist Arthur Pigou – can achieve the desired reduction in emissions more efficiently than direct regulation of polluting activities can.
Policymakers should also apply this lesson to pandemic control.
In the case of climate change, policymakers broadly agree that a tax on emissions is more appropriate than a subsidy not to emit.
But with pandemic control, the choice between taxes and subsidies is not so clear.
In a 1960 article, the Nobel laureate economist Ronald Coase argued that, provided transaction costs can be neglected, the efficient solution to a problem involving a difference between social and private cost should be independent of the allocation of property rights.
For pandemic control, the interests of society are represented by the government, which keeps transaction costs low.
The key question, then, is whether the right to keep a store or restaurant open is held by the owner or instead belongs to society.
The fact that governments are providing compensation during lockdowns indicates that they recognize that the decision whether to stay open should belong to the owner.
It follows that a subsidy aimed at encouraging restaurants and stores to close would be more appropriate than taxing them.
More practically, a closure subsidy offers a number of advantages.
It would provide income compensation to the most marginal businesses at a reasonable fiscal cost, while still reducing social interactions in stores and restaurants.
The subsidy for closing in-store activity should be especially attractive for struggling shops and restaurants, whose owners are most inclined to protest against mandated lockdowns.
And it would obviate the need for policymakers to make arbitrary distinctions between essential and non-essential goods.
Another, longer-term advantage of this approach is that it would encourage small shop owners to modernize (or quit the market).
That way, policymakers might help to overcome the very strong resistance to structural change in this sector.
The lesson is clear: As the second wave of the pandemic threatens Europe, governments should change tack by inducing restaurant, bar, and shop owners to take a paid vacation, rather than ordering them to close.
Such a policy promises much lower fiscal and social costs and would be politically far easier to sustain in the tough winter months ahead.

The Death Penalty – Again
PRINCETON – Three significant events relating to the death penalty occurred in the United States during September.
The one that gained the most publicity was the execution in Georgia of Troy Davis, who had been convicted of the 1989 murder of Mark McPhail, an off-duty police officer.
Davis’s death sentence was carried out despite serious doubts about whether he was guilty of the crime for which he received it.
Witnesses who had testified at his trial later said that prosecutors had coerced them.
Even death-penalty supporters protested against his execution, saying that he should be given a new trial.
But the courts denied his appeals.
In his final words, he proclaimed his innocence.
The deliberate judicial killing of a man who might have been innocent is deeply disturbing.
But the execution was consistent with something that happened just two weeks earlier, at one of the debates between Republican candidates for their party’s nomination to challenge President Barack Obama next year.
Texas Governor Rick Perry was reminded that during his term of office, the death penalty has been carried out 234 times.
No other governor in modern times has presided over as many executions.
But what is more remarkable is that some audience members applauded when the high number of executions was mentioned.
Perry was then asked whether he was ever troubled by the fact that one of them might have been innocent.
He replied that he did not lose any sleep over the executions, because he had confidence in the judicial system in Texas.
In view of the record of mistakes in every other judicial system, such confidence is difficult to justify.
Indeed, less than a month later, Michael Morton, who had served nearly 25 years of a life sentence for the murder of his wife, was released from a Texas prison.
DNA tests had shown that another man was responsible for the crime.
As September drew to a close, the US Supreme Court reached its decision in the case of Manuel Valle, who had been sentenced to death 33 years earlier.
Valle had asked the court to halt his execution, on the grounds that to spend so long on death row is “cruel and unusual punishment” and therefore prohibited by the US constitution.
Justice Stephen Breyer agreed that to spend 33 years in prison awaiting execution is cruel.
In support of that view, he pointed to “barbaric” conditions on death row, and the “horrible” feelings of uncertainty when one is under sentence of execution but does not know whether or when the sentence will be carried out.
Breyer then went on to document the fact that so long a period on death row is also unusual.
It was, in fact, a record, although the average length of time spent on death row in the US is 15 years; in 2009, of 3173 death-row prisoners, 113 had been there for more than 29 years.
So Breyer held that Valle’s treatment was unconstitutional, and that he should not be executed.
But he found no support for his position among the eight other Supreme Court judges.
On September 28, the court rejected Valle’s application, and he was executed that evening.
The US is now the only Western industrialized nation to retain the death penalty for murder.
Of 50 European countries, only Belarus, notorious for its lack of respect for basic human rights, still executes criminals in peacetime.
The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights regards the death penalty as a human-rights violation.
The death penalty is not an effective deterrent.
Murder rates in Europe and other Western industrialized nations are lower, often much lower, than those in the US. In the US itself, the 16 states that have abolished the death penalty generally have lower murder rates than those that retain it.
In the US, however, deterrence is not really the issue.
Retribution is often seen as a more important justification for the death penalty.
It is quite common for family members of the victim to watch the execution of the person convicted of killing their relative, and afterwards to pronounce themselves satisfied that justice has been done – it happened again with the execution of Troy Davis.
In the rest of the Western world, the desire to witness an execution is widely regarded as barbaric, and barely comprehensible.
The idea that the families of murder victims cannot obtain “closure” until the murderer has been executed seems not to be a universal human truth, but a product of a particular culture – perhaps not even American culture as a whole, but rather the culture of the American South, where 80% of all executions take place.
In view of the possibility that Georgia recently executed an innocent man, it is particularly ironic that the South’s voters are America’s most zealous in their efforts to protect innocent human life – as long as that life is still inside the womb, or is that of a person who, suffering from a terminal illness, seeks a doctor’s assistance in order to die when he or she wants.
It is a contradiction that belies what the Republican Party, which dominates the region, promotes as a “culture of life.”

New York, the Dada Capital
I am looking down on Central Park and recall from half-a-century ago in a small town in Northern Romania a tall, white-haired man proclaiming his poem, “The Colors Red and Black.” Gazing over the park, I remember those Stalinist era verses:
In New York, everything is beautiful.
Heroes come, heroes go.
Children, born for Sing-Sing,
cover the streets like pellagra
Yellow karate-blood
pulses through each building.
In the harbor the Statue of Liberty!
Behind her elevated falsehood
Yankee ghosts howl at the moon
tormented as if from pellagra
by the colors red and black.
The red of the Revolution, of course, and the black of the oppressed race.
Cliché was the common currency of all Communist dictatorships, but they had the opposite effect to what the regime intended, for they cast an aura of forbidden fruit around the slandered New World metropolis, making it seem a glowing Olympus of modernity, an urban Everest of adventure.
The few trips I was allowed to take as a citizen of Socialist Romania did, of course, have moments of rapture for me, novice that I was.
Yet New York remained a dream, so foreign and distant that I never imagined I would have the chance to compare illusion with reality.
My eventual escape to New York had nothing to do with tourism.
Sudden terror before this omnipresent, all-devouring monster was soon overtaken by fascination.
The critic Irving Howe, a New Yorker of long standing, tried to temper my enthusiasm.
“To enjoy this city you need a good apartment and a certain salary.”
I was living in a miserable hotel in a rundown neighborhood, consumed with a newcomer’s neurotic insecurity. Yet I found everything irresistible, the city’s rhythms and colors, its contrasts and surprises.
That Walt Whitman and Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Henry James, and John Dos Passos had lived here, that Enescu, Brancusi, or Eugen Ionesco had been successful here in no way raised my hopes.
Life in and with this city was as hypnotic as a drug.
Over the last seventeen years this addiction was established through daily negotiations with life’s routine.
New York’s metabolism filled me with its energy and its toxins.
Although I felt that I, an exile in the land of exiles, belonged ever more to a world to which no one can really be said to belong, on September 11, 2001, I was finally able to proclaim, “I am a New Yorker,” just as President Kennedy had declared himself a Berliner when that former National Socialist capital was in danger of becoming a Communist capital.
The Old Testament tells how work on the tower in Shinar, in ancient Babylon, was disrupted because man aspired to reach the heavens and divinity.
Suddenly the builders could no longer understand each other.
Different languages divided them.
In present-day Babylon in Chinatown, in Little Italy, in Russian Brighton Beach, and in the alleys and byways of New York, all the world’s languages are spoken.
The builders of the twin towers, whatever their native tongues, wanted to be Americans, citizens of the New World, the towers they built symbolizing the stature of freedom.
The attack on the towers of Babel was unexpected but not unpredictable in so far as it represented the hatred of Allah’s fanatical followers for the symbols of modernity.
In the World Trade Center, human creativity and collaboration were universally codified.
Of course, the building lacked poetry.
Yet, the towers could have been a symbol of worldwide poetry, not commerce.
As the Surrealist poet André Breton said, “It is above all our differences that unite us.”
Surprisingly, for such an extensive, cynically efficient cluster of humanity, the city displayed surprising civility and solidarity during and after the attacks.
It immediately regained its strength, its sense of humor, and its industriousness.
After September 11, 2001, skyscrapers, clubs, and restaurants of all kinds sprang up like mushrooms, with almost more vitality than before.
Moreover, the city refused to give its votes to a president who exploited its disaster for political gain.
Romania is often called the Land of Dada, not because one of its sons, Tristan Tzara, was a founder of Surrealism, but because of the absurdity and paradoxes of its daily life, particularly in its politics.
In exile, I immediately identified with another capital of Dada, the “cosmic republic, that speaks all languages in a universal dialect,” as Johannes Baader put it.
Here, the old and the new are accomplices in celebrating life “in all its incomprehensibility” – exactly the subversiveness that the Dadaists loved.
A famous map painted by my friend and compatriot Saul Steinberg depicts the global village as seen from Manhattan: the distance from the Hudson River to the Pacific Ocean is the same as the distance from Ninth to Tenth Avenue on the Upper West Side, and somewhere beyond the calm ocean float Russia, China, and Japan.
Saul’s other maps evoke his past: Milan, the city of his youth, Zurich, where Dada got its explosive start, and the Romanian city Buzau, where he was born.
A map of my own fate would encompass Bukovina as my native land, the Transdnistrian concentration camp of my childhood, the Communist labor camp Periprava where my father’s identity was altered, the Bucharest of my student years and my adulthood, Berlin, my exile’s starting point, and finally New York, where my exile found its residence.
This fate is its own “Babel,” a confused mixture of memories and places.
Here on the Upper West Side, in the middle of a triangle formed by Central Park, Lincoln Center, and the Hudson River, I was once in the habit of beginning each day with an exotic act of devotion, a ritual of humility.
I now had a good apartment and a certain salary, so Irving Howe’s conditions for life in the city were fulfilled.
From my window, I watched the Rubbish Gangster: shaven head, bull neck, and swollen nose, from which dangled mucus-incrusted strands of hair, his short arms bursting with criminal power.
Every day, at the same hour, he appeared with his metal trunk stuffed with all that he had collected from street corner garbage cans; it was as if he wanted to ensnare me with his street sorcery so that I could see the city’s unfathomable contrasts.
The writer, caught up in the shelter of solitude, does not have much time to wander about.
His neighborhood is his world, the geography of his calendar.
Luckily, the streets of New York offer extraordinary spectacles wherever one is.
In the Bronx or in Soho, in Washington Square or Times Square, in front of the New York Public Library or near a hot dog stand, across all the planets’ races, the banal vies with the exceptional for one’s attention.
All faces, ages, and events, sooner or later, can be found here.
Routine increases banality and thoughtlessness; the personal disappears.
You pursue your business here as only New Yorkers can, but every once in a while you look up and wonder, “How did I get here?” Or, rather, “How on earth did mankind come so far?”
I often look at New York’s architecture as if looking at an art book.
On my way home from Bard College, where I teach, I am greeted by the George Washington Bridge majestically suspended over the Hudson River.
It is a glorious welcome, even in fog.
The same is true of the skyline.
Approach the city and you see the urban center of the world – a hard and harried place, marked by social contrasts as dizzying as its skyscrapers and with a sense of transience as elevated as its buildings.
Its workforce labors round the clock and its inventiveness, energy, and diversity counter provincialism with scorn.
Like America itself, although so utterly different, New York can only be comprehended “synthetically.”
This festively incoherent capital of Dada is a spectacular fusion of freedom and pragmatism.
Misery and magnificence, seduction and neurosis create and recreate the dynamic, unmistakable spectrum of New York life.
In this city you learn to limit yourself.
It is impossible to take in at once all of the innumerable symphonic or jazz concerts, or parades celebrating ethnic or sexual minorities.
You can’t attend all the lectures, panel discussions, and auctions where everyday dramas and dreams are bartered.
You can’t sit in all the taxis driven by those loquacious ambassadors from India and Russia and Haiti, from Pakistan and Ghana and Guatemala.
At best you can grab a mere crumb of this frenetic global kaleidoscope.
In the end, in New York you own nothing more than the instant, the now, the right now.
Again I look over Central Park.
“Dada covers things with an artificial tenderness,” wrote Tzara.
“It is snowing butterflies that have escaped from a prophet’s head.”

Japan’s Strategic Imperative
CAMBRIDGE – Last December, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the most ambitious expansion of military power in Japan since the creation of the country’s Self-Defense Forces in 1954.
Japanese defense spending will rise to 2% of GDP – twice the 1% level that has prevailed since 1976 – and a new National Security Strategy lays out all the diplomatic, economic, technological, and military instruments that Japan will use to protect itself in the years ahead.
Most notably, Japan will acquire the kind of long-range missiles that it had previously foresworn, and it will work with the United States to strengthen littoral defenses around the “first island chain” off China.
Last month in Washington, following Kishida’s diplomatic tour through several other G7 countries, he and US President Joe Biden pledged closer defense cooperation.
Among the factors precipitating these changes are China’s increased assertiveness against Taiwan and, especially, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which reminded a new generation of what military aggression looks like.
Of course, some of Japan’s neighbors worry that it will resume its militarist posture of the 1930s.
When Kishida’s predecessor, Abe Shinzō, broadened the constitutional interpretation of self-defense to include collective undertakings with Japanese allies, he stoked concerns both within the region and from some segments of Japanese society.
But such alarmism can be reduced if one explains the full backstory.
After World War II, militarism was deeply discredited within Japan, and not just because the US-imposed constitution restricted the Japanese military’s role to self-defense.
During the Cold War, Japan’s security depended on cooperation with the US.
When the Cold War ended in the 1990s, some analysts – in both countries – regarded the bilateral security treaty, in force since 1952, as a relic, and a Japanese commission was created to study whether Japan could do without it, such as by relying on the United Nations instead.
But the end of the Cold War did not mean that Japan no longer lived in a dangerous region.
Its next-door neighbor is North Korea’s unpredictable dictatorship, which has consistently invested the country’s meager economic resources in nuclear and missile technology.
A much larger, longer-term concern is the rise of China, which surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest economy in 2010, and which disputes Japan’s control of the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.
To the north, a nuclear-armed Russia claims and controls territory that belonged to Japan before 1945.
And on the economic front, Japan remains dependent on imports that travel through contested areas like the South China Sea.
This is a persistent source of risk, because, unlike Europe after 1945, East Asia never benefited from full reconciliation between rivals or established strong regional institutions.
Faced with this situation, Japan has had four options for ensuring its security, only one of which has held much promise.
Amending the pacifism out of its constitution and fully re-arming as a nuclear state would be costly, dangerous, and lacks domestic support.
At the same time, seeking neutrality and relying on the UN Charter would not provide adequate security, while forming an alliance with China would give the latter far too much influence over Japanese policy.
Or, lastly, it could maintain its alliance with the distant superpower.
That alliance is by far the safest and most cost-effective option.
But since Donald Trump won the US presidency in 2016, some Japanese have worried about America turning to isolationism.
Even in the early 1990s, when I was involved in renegotiating the terms of the US-Japan alliance at the end of the Cold War, high-ranking Japanese officials would ask me if the US might someday abandon Japan as China became stronger.
Back then, many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat, and many Japanese were open to a more UN-centered approach to ensuring their national security.
The situation changed with the Clinton administration’s 1995 East Asia Strategy Report, which invited greater Chinese participation in international affairs but also hedged against uncertainty by reinforcing the alliance with Japan.
In 1996, the Clinton-Hashimoto Tokyo Declaration made clear that the US-Japan security alliance was the foundation for post-Cold War stability in East Asia.
Still, there were questions about the reliability of American guarantees, leading to discussions among US and Japanese security experts, who helped flesh out the principle of American “extended deterrence.”
The best security guarantee is the presence of US troops, which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support.
The new measures announced by Kishida and Biden in January are designed both to reinforce this guarantee and to provide reinsurance in the event that Trump or a Trump-like figure returns to the White House.
Importantly, these measures do not give Japan’s neighbors any reason to fear that it has reacquired a taste for aggression.
In fact, strengthening the US-Japan alliance is the best way to ensure that Japan never does.
For the past two decades, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and I have issued bipartisan reports on how to strengthen the US-Japan alliance.
As one such report explains, “With the dynamic changes taking place throughout the Asia-Pacific, Japan will likely never have the same opportunity to help guide the fate of the region.
In choosing leadership, Japan can secure her status as a tier-one nation and her necessary role as an equal partner in the alliance.”
In this context, Kishida’s recent actions can be seen as appropriate steps in the right direction.
There is enormous potential for developing a more equal partnership and working with others in the provision of joint security.
Doing so will be good for the US, good for Japan, and good for the rest of the world.
Recent events offer grounds for optimism about the future of the US-Japan alliance and stability in East Asia.

China’s Credit Overdose
SHANGHAI – The days of double-digit economic growth in China are over.
Indeed, the annual growth rate, which has been lingering at about 7.5% since 2012, is predicted to fall to 7% this year – and is likely to go lower.
This is China’s “new normal,” characterized, according to China’s leaders, by “medium-to-high-speed” (instead of high-speed) growth.
But perhaps even this is optimistic.
In the last two years, credit grew almost twice as fast as GDP, and total social financing grew even faster.
Yet GDP growth slowed considerably – from an annual average of 10.2% in 2002-2011 – suggesting that China may be moving closer to a medium-to-low-speed growth path.
One possible explanation for the divergence between credit and GDP growth is that potential growth has already dropped to 7%.
But such a sharp decline in potential growth typically implies a powerful brake, in the form of an external shock or major internal adjustments.
Under normal circumstances, an economy’s potential growth rate adjusts naturally and gradually, as structural change progresses.
In fact, there is no definitive evidence that China’s potential growth rate has plunged.
China weathered the 2008 global economic crisis better than other emerging economies.
And, though structural factors, including an aging population and shrinking labor force, can certainly undermine potential growth, their effects are not sudden.
So what explains the sharp decline in China’s economic output, in an environment of rapid credit expansion?
The answer is simple: the way the credit is being used.
Before the crisis, credit expansion in China kept pace with GDP growth.
Since the end of 2008, however, credit amounting to 35% of GDP has been issued annually, causing the credit-to-GDP ratio to soar from less than 150% before the crisis to 250% today.
That means that credit has become much less efficient.
The problem stems from the CN¥4 trillion ($660 billion) stimulus plan that the government launched in 2008, which fueled the creation of about CN¥14 trillion worth of credit – and supported a rapid increase in fixed-asset investment, especially in infrastructure and real-estate development.
When, in late 2009, the investment-intensive economy began to show signs of overheating, the government imposed strict macroeconomic controls, forcing investors to halt ongoing projects.
Growth fell immediately.
Meanwhile, debt continued to rise – not least because of the continued accumulation of interest.
Indeed, according to the political economist Victor Shih, the interest that accrued to all debts in China in 2010 amounted to 80% of incremental nominal GDP.
In 2012, the two figures were nearly equivalent, with interest rising to 140% of incremental nominal GDP in 2013 and, Shih expects, to 200% for 2014.
Local governments, in particular, have struggled with a colossal volume of bad debt, which has undermined their capacity for capital expenditure and frozen out private demand for productive investment.
Stringent controls on the real-estate market placed a heavy burden on the developers themselves, as well as related industries like steel.
Yet China’s government failed to acknowledge – much less address – the bad debts in a timely manner, instead allowing them to grow even larger.
Given that the only way to enable borrowers to avoid default – at least temporarily – has been to provide an ever-increasing amount of liquidity, even banks facing liquidity constraints have remained willing to extend new loans.
Though China’s high national savings rate means that it does not have to borrow liquidity from abroad or print large amounts of money, the risks it faces should not be underestimated.
With such a large share of the new liquidity being used to cover debt service, there is little left to finance new, growth-stimulating investment.
Moreover, as debts grow ever larger, banks’ willingness to lend will decline, driving debtors to the unregulated shadow-banking sector, where interest rates are extremely high, for their liquidity needs.
The rising cost of financing will further undermine fixed-asset investment (and thus economic growth).
China’s “new normal” is actually not normal at all.
While the growth curve and structural changes in the East Asian economy from the 1960s to the 1990s suggest that China could experience medium-to-high growth rates for another decade, the country must address its debt problem first.
The first step is to cut interest rates immediately, thereby reducing the burden on debtors and bolstering GDP growth.
The government must also pursue a more active fiscal policy, rather than focusing on monetary policy.
Furthermore, given that local governments and state-owned enterprises are responsible for the majority of China’s bad debts, write-offs, funded by central-government bonds, will probably be necessary – and soon.
Though the “debt swap” scheme that the finance ministry just introduced – which allows highly leveraged local governments to swap CN¥1 trillion of debt maturing this year for bonds with lower interest rates – is a step in the right direction, it is far from adequate.
With the central government enjoying such favorable fiscal conditions – its debt-to-GDP ratio stands at only about 20% – now is the ideal time to initiate a much larger debt-swap program.
Of course, curbing future debt accumulation is also vital to China’s long-term prosperity.
That is why China must reduce local governments’ dependence on banks to meet their financing needs, by nurturing bond and equity markets.
The debt-induced distortions in China’s economy today are precisely that – distortions.
They are not a fundamental feature of the economy, and they need not characterize China’s new normal.
With the right strategy, the authorities can eliminate these distortions and allow the economy to reach its medium-to-high-speed growth potential over the next decade.

The EU, Serbia, and the Balkans
BRUSSELS: On September 24, despite a system heavily rigged against them, Serbia’s people voted – in huge numbers – for spring after a long political winter.
They demanded a new start for their country – the chance to consign to history the economic and political misery endured in recent years.
Today, they have that new start.
Ten years after the rest of postcommunist Europe, Serbia must begin establishing an open, democratic society.
The EU has made clear its willingness to help a democratic Serbia re-join the family of Europe.
The EU symbolizes one of history’s most successful attempts by countries and peoples to overcome division through partnership and co-operation, where competition on a level playing field replaces battlefield conflict.
Fifty years ago, few thought that possible.
Much of Western Europe was rubble.
Enmities smoldered.
With generous support from America, we built a robust community of democracies, whose economic wealth and political liberty helped us stand firm in the face of tyranny.
Yugoslavia’s enmities, and the ruins of its economy, need to be addressed in a similar spirit.
The EU’s record is clear.
When Communism collapsed, we set about helping the countries of Eastern Europe to establish democracy and make the transition to the market economy.
We did so with the same commitment and faith in their ability to succeed that the US devoted to re-building Western Europe after WWII.
In the ten years since the Berlin Wall’s fall these countries have been transformed and are on the way to joining the EU.
War in Europe, we told ourselves, could never happen again.
But it did, in the Balkans.
All Europe’s demons had not been exorcised.
After a decade of war, we are now humbler, wiser, I hope – but more determined to turn the page, to work with the countries and peoples of Southeast Europe not to escape their neighborhood, but to transform it.
That is what the Stability Pact is about – a recognition that the region’s problems must be tackled in the round; a recognition that coping with crisis after crisis is far more costly than implementing a long-term strategy for peace.
The EU, indeed, faces few greater tests of its ability to project stability than in the Balkans.
Last year in Kosovo, America bore the brunt of the military campaign.
American and European peacekeepers serve alongside each other in Kosovo and in Bosnia.
Nearly two thirds of those troops – some 30,000 of them – are from EU nations.
Our overall strategy is clear: to build a strong, stable network of democracies in the region, a network that – we hope – will now include Serbia.
We are starting to implement such a strategy by building, literally and metaphorically, Southeast Europe’s road to integration with the rest of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community.
That road is built on a foundation in which solid reform is backed by substantial assistance.
We have spent nearly 8bn euros in reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in the region since 1991; EU financial assistance to the region during those years amounts to 17bn euros.
This year, the European Commission is spending nearly 600m euros rebuilding lives in Kosovo and Bosnia, backing brave and newly elected leaders in Croatia, supporting reform in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYROM) and Albania.
In Montenegro, the EU provided considerable support as its government stood up to Milosevic.
We doubled – to 20 million euros – the EU’s assistance to Montenegro this year.
The European Council in Lisbon ordered further assistance to help alleviate the immediate financial needs of Montenegro.
We stand ready to offer assistance to Serbia in the same spirit.
When Serbia’s new leaders look around, indeed, they can see real progress in the region: in Croatia, which has blazed a democratic trail since elections earlier this year; in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has nearly concluded negotiations with the EU for a Stabilization and Association Agreement, the first country to do so; in Albania, which is persevering with political and economic reforms; and in Bosnia, where refugee return has accelerated.
Even in Kosovo, where obstacles remain formidable, progress is being made.
That progress is taking place at a regional level too: a regional investment compact, a regional anti-corruption initiative, media reform.
Agreements to upgrade the Blace border-crossing between fYROM and Kosovo, and to build a new bridge over the Danube between Bulgaria and Romania have been made.
These are real achievements, which the Stability Pact helped broker.
Europe is also funding a substantial package of >Quick Start’ projects – ready to begin now or in the next twelve months – to upgrade bridges, roads, airports, water systems, and electricity networks across the region.
Just as important are projects to install institutional >software’ - public administration, a free media, independent judiciaries, functioning, accountable institutions in which all members of the community can place trust and confidence.
The European Commission pledged 530 million euros for projects under the Quick Start package.
Cooperation, however, is a two-way street.
To succeed, these efforts must be matched with equal determination by the countries of the region in delivering on reform.
That approach – help for self-help, inextricably linked to actual reforms – lies at the heart of the EU’s Stabilization and Association process.
That process will bring – is already starting to bring – substantial benefits to the region in terms of trade access, political dialogue, and regional co-operation.
Indeed, we recently agreed radical proposals to expand trade access – through asymmetric trade measures – to the EU market for the countries of the region.
These come into effect on 1 November.
Eighteen months after the air strikes in Kosovo, we are making headway.
The changes in Serbia provide evidence that the people of Serbia, too, have noticed what is happening in the rest of their region and no longer want to miss out.
We, too, don’t want them to miss out on better ties to Europe.

The Disunited States of American Gun Control
LONDON – The Las Vegas massacre and its aftermath are pure Americana.
A deranged person lugs nearly two dozen high-tech assault weapons to a 32nd-floor hotel room to spray death upon concertgoers in a mass murder and suicide.
In response, the culture wars flare anew, with gun-control advocates in pitched battle against gun enthusiasts.
Yet there is consensus on one deep truth: nothing much will change.
After a week of televised, heart-wrenching funerals, American life will go on until the next massacre.
Mass violence is deeply rooted in American culture.
America’s European settlers committed a two-century-long genocide against the native inhabitants, and established a slave economy so deeply entrenched that only a devastating civil war ended it. In almost all other countries, even Czarist Russia, slavery and serfdom were ended by decree or legislation, without a four-year bloodletting.
When it was over, America established and enforced a century-long system of apartheid.
To this day, America’s homicide and imprisonment rates are several times higher than Europe’s.
Several large mass shootings occur each year – in a country that is also waging several seemingly endless wars overseas.
America is, in short, a country with a past history and current stark reality of racism, ethnic chauvinism, and resort to mass violence.
The Las Vegas shootings make clear once more the need to ban assault weapons.
When America had such a ban, from September 1994-September 2004, it helped to limit mass shootings; yet Congress failed to renew the ban, owing to intense lobbying from gun enthusiasts. Nor is the ban about to be reinstated any time soon at the federal level.
A prohibition against “bump stocks,” the device used by the Las Vegas killer to enable his semi-automatic rifles to fire like fully automatic weapons, appears possible; but there will be little more federal action than that.
When Australia banned assault weapons in 1996, mass shootings stopped abruptly.
America’s gun lovers reject such evidence, and mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas serve only to reinforce their belief that firearms are their only true protection in a dangerous world.
According to compelling recent survey data, the attachment to guns is especially intense among less-educated white Republican men residing mainly in rural and suburban areas in the South and Midwest – the same demographic that forms the core of support for President Donald Trump.
Despite the deep ideological divisions in the country, there is a glimmer of hope.
Under the US Constitution, states have the authority to ban assault weapons and regulate firearms (though not to ban handguns and rifles outright, given the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Second Amendment’s “right to bear arms”).
My own state, New York, already bans assault weapons, as do a handful of other states.
Rather than fighting another ill-fated battle in Washington, it is more promising to encourage many more states to exercise their prerogatives.
States that do will have lower rates of mass shootings, more secure citizens, and more vibrant economies.
Las Vegas will suffer not only from the trauma of the recent massacre, but also from a diversion of tourism and conferences, at least until Nevada cracks down on assault weapons and can guarantee visitors’ safety.
America today doesn’t just have red (conservative) states and blue (progressive) states, but de facto red countries and blue countries, that is, distinct regions with distinct cultures, heroes, politics, dialects, economies, and ideas of freedom.
In New York City, freedom means not having to fear that the thousands of strangers sharing the city’s sidewalks and parks with you on any given day are carrying deadly weapons.
In Texas or Las Vegas, freedom is the comfort of carrying your trusty firearms anywhere you like.
It’s time to let red states and blue states go their own way.
We don’t need to fight another civil war to agree on an amicable and limited move to much looser linkages across the states.
In this, the conservatives have it right: Let’s reduce the power of the federal government and turn more revenues and regulations back to the states, subject to the constitutional limits on the division of powers and fundamental rights.
That way, each side of the culture wars can move closer to its preferred outcomes without impeding the other side from doing the same.
My own state would thrive in such a looser federation, using its increased margin of maneuver to tighten its own regulations and to scale up its social services with the savings in taxes now paid to the federal government.
And the weaker federal government would mean fewer US “wars of choice” in the Middle East.
At some point, the US will end up with federal gun control legislation.
When more Congressmen come to realize that their own lives are on the line – which, sadly, they are – we will finally see national action.
Two members of Congress have already been shot this decade (Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 and Steve Scalise earlier this year).
For now, however, members of Congress will remain caught in the political crossfire of mad gunmen and pro-gun lobbyists.
This is terrifying, but sadly the case.
In Trump’s America, gun violence and instability are being stoked daily.
A rapidly implemented, national-scale solution would be ideal. But until that happens, more US states should be encouraged to choose gun sanity for themselves.

Understanding Brazil’s Insurrection
SÃO PAULO – The January 8 insurrection in Brazil’s capital was driven by a mix of factors. Participants’ delirium, passion, obstinacy, and resentment, as well as their lack of education and political literacy, all played a part.
While none of these factors justifies what happened, they can help us understand why it happened.
Like his role model, former US President Donald Trump, Brazil’s defeated president, Jair Bolsonaro, spun the narrative and created the conditions that led his followers to attack the seat of democratic governance.
Well before losing his re-election bid in 2020, Trump had sowed doubts about the process, telling his supporters that fraud was likely.
Bolsonaro followed suit, suggesting to his followers that if he lost the 2022 election, they should conclude that it was rigged against him.
In both cases, the incumbents had prepared the ground for challenging the election results and fomenting outrage among their supporters.
And once they had indeed lost, their followers had a clear target.
While Trump ultimately mobilized his supporters to challenge the vote-certification process in the US Senate, where Vice President Mike Pence was the presiding officer, Bolsonaro focused on the issue of electronic voting machines, which are managed by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) under the leadership of Justice Alexandre de Moraes.
Since Bolsonaro had no concrete evidence to show that the electronic voting machines were vulnerable, he relied on the old maxim: “If you can’t convince them, confuse them.”
Many of his supporters already had their sights set on the TSE and de Moraes before the election.
When Bolsonaro lost by only a narrow margin, even as his party performed well in the parliamentary election, the outcome seemed to corroborate his pre-election warnings about a looming communist coup (at least in the minds of his supporters).
Then, in the weeks following the election, false, distorted, and exaggerated reports of voting irregularities were pumped out to Bolsonaro’s base through social media and other channels.
Consumed by their dissatisfaction, many began to imagine that the result could still be reversed.
The first step was to deny the legitimacy of the newly elected government, in order to justify suspending the usual rules.
The events of January 8 followed from the participants’ collective belief, which followed from the signals they had received from the former president and his allies, that violence and other lawless behavior were justified in confronting an even greater act of “illegality.”
While the full implications of January 8 remain to be seen, we can already trace some of the immediate effects.
First, there is no denying that Bolsonarismo has shot itself in the foot.
Even if the attacks on government buildings were spontaneous, they revealed a failure by Federal District Governor Ibaneis Rocha, a Bolsonaro ally, to provide basic public security.
And if they were premeditated, they demonstrated an utter lack of maturity on the part of the planners.
Either way, Bolsonarismo’s image has been further tarnished.
Any future peaceful demonstrations will be closely monitored, and more mainstream politicians who have previously aligned themselves with Bolsonaro presumably will not want to play a leading role in the official opposition.
Does Bolsonaro want to lead the opposition to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva within Brazil’s political institutions, or does he want to lead an opposition movement in the streets?
He cannot have it both ways.
To lead the formal opposition, Bolsonaro will have to condemn the insurrection unambiguously; but if he sides with the insurrectionists, he will strengthen Lula’s position vis-à-vis Congress.
After all, January 8 has brought together numerous government and opposition parliamentarians, and Lula will be looking to peel off support from center-right politicians who are questioning their ties to the former president.
Lula’s administration has promised a full investigation of the insurrection, including how it was funded and planned.
Hundreds of participants have been arrested and will be prosecuted.
One pressing question is how the informal street opposition will respond now that de Moraes has temporarily removed Rocha.
Could Bolsonaro allies leading other states meet a similar fate?
Much will depend on what Lula, Minister of Defense José Múcio, and Minister of Justice Flávio Dino do in the coming days.
If they indulge their sense of outrage, they will risk strengthening the street opposition.
They must choose whether to focus on the acts that can be prosecuted under the law. Targeting their enemies more broadly would merely perpetuate the pattern of polarization, further trivializing terms like “fascist” and “communist.”
But if the government ensures accountability for criminal acts, it can reinforce the message that any attacks on democratic institutions, regardless of whether they come from the left or the right, will be met by swift enforcement of the rule of law.
More broadly, January 8 shows what can happen when democracy is understood merely as a process, rather than as a core value.
With Bolsonarismo having discredited itself, Brazil’s democracy is not immediately at risk. But that could change quickly unless Brazilians develop a more mature appreciation of how and why the procedures of democracy work.

The Next Chinese Economy
BEIJING – After more than 30 years of extraordinary growth, the Chinese economy is shifting onto a more conventional development path – and a difficult rebalancing is underway, affecting nearly every aspect of the economy.
For starters, China’s current-account surplus has shrunk from its 2007 peak of 10% of GDP to just over 2% last year – its lowest level in nine years.
In the third quarter of 2014, China’s external surplus stood at $81.5 billion and its capital and financial account deficits amounted to $81.6 billion, reflecting a more stable balance of payments.
This shift can partly be explained by the fact that, over the last two years, developed countries have been pursuing re-industrialization to boost their trade competitiveness.
In the United States, for example, manufacturing grew at an annual rate of 4.3%, on average, in 2011-2012, and growth in durable-goods manufacturing reached 8% – having risen from 4.1% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2002 and 2007.
Indeed, America’s manufacturing industry has helped to drive its macroeconomic recovery.
Meanwhile, as China’s wage costs rise, its labor-intensive manufacturing industries are facing increasingly intense competition, with the likes of India, Mexico, Vietnam, and some Eastern European economies acting as new, more cost-effective bases for industrial transfer from developed countries.
As a result, the recovery in the advanced economies is not returning Chinese export demand to pre-crisis levels.
These trends – together with the continued appreciation of the renminbi – have contributed to the decline of Chinese goods’ market share in developed countries.
Indeed, Chinese exports have lost some 2.3% of market share in the developed world since 2013, and about 2% in the US since 2011.
Incipient trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and the Plurilateral Services Agreement will accelerate this process further, as they eliminate tariffs among certain countries and implement labor and environmental criteria.
Add to that furtive protectionism, in the form of state assistance and government procurement, and Chinese exports are facing serious challenges.
China is also undergoing an internal rebalancing of investment and consumption.
As it stands, declining growth in fixed-asset investment – from 33% in 2009 to 16% this year – is placing significant downward pressure on output growth.
Investment’s contribution to GDP growth fell from 8.1 percentage points in 2009 to 4.2 last year.
One reason for the decline is that China has yet to absorb the production capacity created by large-scale investment in 2010-2011.
Aside from traditional industries like steel, non-ferrous metals, construction materials, chemical engineering, and shipbuilding, excess capacity is now affecting emerging industries like wind power, photovoltaics, and carbon fiber, with many using less than 75% of their production capacity.
But the decline in investment is also directly correlated with that of capital formation.
In 1996-2012, China’s average incremental capital-output ratio – the marginal capital investment needed to increase overall output by one unit – was a relatively high 3.9, meaning that capital investment in China was less efficient than in developing countries experiencing similar levels of growth.
Moreover, the cyclical increase in financing rates and factor costs has brought a gradual restoration of the price scissors of industrial and agricultural goods.
As a result, industrial firms’ profits are likely to continue to fall, making it difficult to sustain high investment.
Meanwhile, the expansion of China’s middle class is having a major impact on consumption.
Last year, China surpassed Japan to become the second-largest consumer market in the world, after the US.
To be sure, Chinese imports remain focused on intermediate goods, with imports of raw materials like iron ore having surged over the last decade.
But, in the last few years, the share of imported consumption goods and mixed-use (consumption and investment) finished products, such as automobiles and computers, has increased considerably. This trend will contribute to a more balanced global environment.
The final piece of China’s rebalancing puzzle is technology.
As it stands, a lag in technological adoption and innovation is contributing to the growing divide between China and the Western developed countries, stifling economic transformation and upgrading, and hampering China’s ability to move up global value chains.
But, as China’s per capita income increases, its consumer market matures, and its industrial structure is transformed, demand for capital equipment and commercial services will increase considerably.
Indeed, over the next decade, China’s high-tech market is expected to reach annual growth rates of 20-40%.
If the US loosens restrictions on exports to China and maintains its 18.3% share of China’s total imports, American exports of high-tech products to China stand to reach more than $60 billion over this period.
This would accelerate industrial upgrading and innovation in China, while improving global technological transmission and expanding related investment in developed countries.
China’s economy may be decelerating, but its prospects remain strong.
Its GDP may have reached $10 trillion in 2014.
Once it weathers the current rebalancing, it could well be stronger than ever.

What Italy’s Crisis Means for Europe
MILAN – Since the populist Five Star Movement and the right-wing League captured a combined parliamentary majority in Italy’s March 4th election, Italian politics has been at an impasse, with the two parties struggling to form a government.
But now, with President Sergio Mattarella having rejected a M5S/League proposal to appoint the staunchly Euroskeptic economist Paolo Savona as Minister of Economy and Finance, the situation has taken a dramatic turn.
Rather than explore more moderate alternatives, the coalition has abandoned negotiations and called for a new election.
An attempt to form an interim technocratic administration chosen by Mattarella was followed by a clash with the populists, which could have led to a constitutional crisis and spooked the markets.
Now the situation seems to have changed again, and a coalition government is back on the table.
But the situation remains highly fluid – and volatile.
This is the first time in Italy’s postwar history that a coalition of parties from the political extremes has attempted to form a government without any input from centrist forces.
For their part, M5S and the League represent two different, but possibly overlapping, constituencies.
Whereas M5S’s stronghold is in Italy’s poorer south, the League’s is in the country’s prosperous north, where a large small-business community harbors fears of immigration, globalization, and high taxes.
Neither party represents Italians who want change but still support Italy’s membership in the European Monetary Union (EMU).
These voters’ voice has been relatively subdued, but now Mattarella is tenaciously channeling it.
A new election could take place as soon as this fall, or early in 2019.
Either way, it will now essentially be a referendum on the euro.
The campaign will be bitter and divisive, and the outcome will not generate greater certainty about the future.
Elections to the European Parliament will be held in May 2019, and the situation in Italy will no doubt mobilize nationalist and Euroskeptic parties hoping to change the European Union’s political equilibrium.
Given that Italy is a founding EU member state with a long pro-European tradition, it is worth asking how we arrived at this point, and how the EU should respond.
Italy’s economic problems are rooted in low productivity, unfavorable demographics, and weak governance in many parts of the country – all of which pre-date the introduction of the euro in 1999.
While Italy’s mainstream political leaders hoped that eurozone membership would create the conditions for far-reaching economic reform, the euro has instead deprived Italy of the means to engage in competitive devaluation.
With the exception of Greece, Italy has fared worse than any other euro member state since the 2008 financial crisis.
But there is no use playing the blame game.
Responsibility lies partly with the EU and its pro-cyclical policy rules, but mainly with Italy’s past leaders, all of whom failed to address its structural problems.
The Italian story is different from the Irish, Spanish, and Portuguese boom-bust narrative of recent years.
Italy experienced neither a credit-fueled boom during its first decade of euro membership, nor a traditional bust.
The country’s problems are structural and will require a creative reform program that addresses the deep causes of its dismal economic performance over the past 20-plus years.
Unfortunately, neither EU-recommended fiscal discipline nor populist-style fiscal profligacy will fix this fundamental problem.
Instead, Italy needs aggressive action to help the truly productive parts of the economy grow faster and exploit potential external demand.
Rather than designing industrial policies to subsidize the losers, Italy should be providing opportunities for new market entrants, to reverse the high rate of emigration by skilled young people.
Italy also needs more public investment in infrastructure and education, which will require addressing corruption, inefficient judicial processes, and ineffective local institutions – problems that have dogged Southern Italy, in particular.
Beyond this domestic agenda, Italy also needs to pursue reforms vis-à-vis the EU, starting with a relaxation of constraints on public spending for pro-growth investments and new partnerships.
More investment will require additional fiscal space.
But, more importantly, Italy and the EU both need new ideas, and more trust on each side.
Of course, whether the EU would even engage in such a discussion in the absence of credible Italian leadership remains an open question.
EU rules cannot easily accommodate the problems of a country that is unable to consolidate its debt as a result of structurally weak growth – even if it has run large primary surpluses for years.
More broadly, whereas the discussion about reforming eurozone economic governance has long focused on enhancing risk-sharing mechanisms to strengthen resilience against economic shocks and financial crises, that emphasis is somewhat beside the point in Italy’s case, because it offers no cure for structural weakness.
Addressing the latter will require deeper EU-level cooperation on a growth agenda, which presupposes a formal deal on the timing and schedule of fiscal consolidation.
The economic agenda proposed by Italy’s populist parties is fanciful and unconvincing.
But that is no excuse for the EU to maintain the status quo.
It is time for EU leaders to start thinking outside the box to formulate a growth strategy for the bloc’s fourth-largest member state.
At this point, Italy looks more like Japan than Spain or Portugal, and policies need to reflect that fact.
Italy and the EU are at an inflection point.
In the absence of concerted action, we may well be sleepwalking toward another euro crisis – one that would be much harder to overcome than the last, and which could threaten the current composition of the EU itself.

The Fastest Way Out of the Pandemic
GENEVA – Every day, the COVID-19 pandemic costs the world thousands more lives and billions more dollars.
The most efficient way to bring this crisis to an end – possibly as early as next year – is with a safe and effective vaccine, manufactured in large quantities and distributed globally.
To avoid any unnecessary delays, governments should take this moment, while researchers work to develop the right formula, to prepare the ground for rapid production and broad, equitable deployment.
This is the principle on which the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility is based.
Created by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, this innovative platform aims to distribute at least two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021.
That many doses – which will be divided equitably among participating countries, regardless of their ability to pay – would cover some 20% of populations in participating countries.
It would thus be sufficient to protect high-risk and vulnerable people and frontline health-care workers worldwide.
(Additional doses would also be stockpiled, so that any future outbreak could be tackled before it spun out of control.)
As it stands, over 160 vaccine candidates are in preclinical or clinical development.
There is no way to know which will pass clinical trials and be licensed (failure rates of vaccines in early development are high). But we can ensure that, by the time one does, an effective framework for manufacture and deployment is in place.
To that end, governments must invest in COVAX as soon as possible.
The problem is that governments may feel compelled to eschew cooperation, in favor of negotiating directly with vaccine manufacturers to claim the doses they need.
Yes, governments are duty-bound to protect their own citizens above all.
But this national approach carries serious risks, beginning with the possibility that a government may back the wrong vaccines.
Even if a government secures enough doses of an effective vaccine for its own population, some of its people – such as those who are immunocompromised and may not be able to be vaccinated – would be left exposed if other countries are unable to obtain enough vaccine.
And this leaves aside the moral imperative of ensuring that people are not cut off from lifesaving drugs.
During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, a few countries cornered the vaccine market, leaving the vast majority of the global population with no vaccine at all until the outbreak was effectively over.
This scenario must be avoided at all costs during the current crisis, not least because COVID-19 has a much higher infection and mortality rate.
By collaborating with global health agencies through COVAX, governments can ensure that everyone has equal access to COVID-19 vaccines.
For countries that have secured bilateral deals with manufacturers, COVAX amounts to an insurance policy, in case they bet on the wrong candidates.
For countries that haven’t secured any deals – the vast majority of the world – COVAX is the only way to avoid being pushed to the back of the line.
COVAX ensures that the benefits and risks of vaccine development are broadly shared.
With the largest portfolio of vaccine candidates anywhere in the world, it gives participating governments the best odds of receiving a safe and effective vaccine as soon as it becomes available – and ensures that this moment comes much sooner.
When pharmaceutical companies are shouldering all of the financial risks, they will invest in scaling up production only after their vaccine has completed clinical trials and been approved.
This approach may make business sense, but it does not make sense in the context of a rapidly moving global pandemic.
COVAX employs a radically different approach.
In addition to using “push” financing – direct investment in research, development, and manufacturing – it uses “pull” financing, in the form of advance purchase commitments for large numbers of doses upon licensure.
This provides powerful incentives for the private sector to support urgent vaccine development.
Moreover, COVAX pools government resources to fund scaling up the most promising candidates even before clinical trials are completed.
That way, when approval comes, large quantities of vaccine doses will be ready to go.
Already, WHO is working with a range of stakeholders, including member states and civil-society organizations, to develop and implement a mechanism for equitable and fair allocation of vaccine doses, once they become available.
COVAX will support only vaccine candidates that are developed in accordance with the highest possible safety standards.
By working with experts around the world to develop target product profiles, share best-practice testing models, facilitate multi-country clinical trials, and promote regulatory harmonization, COVAX will establish a new benchmark for rapid, safe, and efficacious vaccine development and delivery.
We cannot afford to leave our economies on their current path for much longer.
As global GDP shrinks – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank forecast about a 5% contraction in 2020 – poverty and hunger are rising sharply.
With the world economy losing more than $10 billion each day, shortening the pandemic by even a few days would more than offset the costs of COVAX.
Global collaboration – where risks and benefits are shared equally – has never been a better value proposition.

Licking the Boot that Kicks You
NEW YORK – Watching Michael D. Cohen, US President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and self-described “fixer,” testify to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform was a remarkable spectacle to behold.
Here was a man who was hired by Trump to behave like a gangster.
And he did that to perfection.
When The Daily Beast was about to report on allegations by Trump’s first wife, Ivana, that her husband had raped her, Cohen barked at the journalist working on the story: “So I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting.
You understand me?”
That journalist was hardly alone.
Cohen’s job was to threaten anyone who got in the way of his old boss.
He lied to congressional committees, paid off prostitutes to stop them from talking about their affairs with Trump, and much else.
Cohen, who will soon begin serving a three-year prison sentence, has become what Mafiosi (and Trump) call a “rat.”
Testifying against his old boss in Congress, Cohen neither looked nor sounded like a thug.
He recalled a very different type of person.
Anyone who has ever spent time in a school playground will recognize him: the weakling hanging around the swaggering bully, doing his bidding, while constantly being humiliated himself.
With his hurt-puppy eyes and slack mouth, Cohen plays that part to perfection as well.
On one occasion, when Cohen was still, in his own words, prepared to “take a bullet” for his boss, he had to delay his son’s bar mitzvah ceremony, because Trump decided to show up late.
When he finally arrived, he demeaned Cohen in front of family and friends by claiming that the only reason he came was because his fixer had begged him to.
This tells you everything about the relationship between the narcissist and the sycophant, or the sadist and the masochist.
They feed off one another.
The worshipper’s desire to worship is just as strong as the narcissist’s craving to be slavishly admired.
You only need to glance at entries on Facebook to observe the phenomenon.
For every person who posts a self-flattering picture (usually taken years before) or a rave review of his or her latest book (often tempered by false modesty: “I’m so humbled ...”), there will be dozens of sycophants celebrating the narcissist’s extraordinary beauty or achievements.
The urge to flatter is as conspicuous as the spectacle of self-love.
There is something quite primitive about this: the weak seek protection from the strong by obsequiousness, and the narcissist gains his or her power from their submission.
This does not always lead to abuse, but it very often does.
Mankind has invented many ways to moderate such abuse and channel these desires in directions that are less likely to cause harm.
Religion offers an abstract focus for worship and submission; it is not for nothing that several faiths forbid creating images of living beings.
In our more secular times, the reverence for spiritual idols has been replaced by adoration of rock stars or sports heroes.
When John Lennon once outraged religious Americans by claiming that The Beatles were more popular than Jesus, he was only half-joking.
The worship of rock stars is relatively harmless.
But when narcissists gain political power, the results are anything but harmless.
Charisma feeding off adoration leads to mass hysteria.
Critics and naysayers must be eliminated.
Power goes unchecked.
The pseudo-religious trappings of the great twentieth-century dictatorships are a terrible example.
To many Chinese, Russians, and Germans, their leaders were gods.
What is easy to overlook is that such worship is not always coerced.
Many people become sycophants of power willingly.
Submission, paradoxically, makes them feel less weak.
Trump is not a dictator, but he would dearly love to be.
His own toadying to the world’s strongmen, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, is a sign of this.
But the source of his considerable popularity in the United States is still baffling to many people who have not fallen under his sway.
They cannot grasp how a coarse, vain, self-absorbed fantasist can possibly have such broad appeal.
After all, liberals say, it is all show.
But that is precisely the point.
Of course it is all show – just like religious ceremonies, or Nazi or Maoist rallies.
Trump may not be knowledgeable, sophisticated, curious, or well read, but he has a fine instinct for the psychology of power and submission.
He knows how to weld people who feel weak and unrecognized into mobs drawn to his spectacle of angry charisma.
His self-love makes his followers love themselves and hate their enemies.
His is a great and dangerous gift.
Trump’s massive rallies in the American heartland are his relationship with his former fixer writ large.
One of Cohen’s more bizarre remarks in his congressional testimony was that he had lied, but that he was not a liar.
Perhaps he meant this sincerely.
His point might have been that he wasn’t really himself when he was lying for his boss.
He was literally under Trump’s spell, mesmerized, almost sleepwalking.
That is also what people say who once cheered wildly for dictators, and then can’t explain why they did so once the great leaders have fallen and times have changed.
It is hard to say at this point how much of Cohen’s testimony is true.
His claims certainly jibe with what others in Trump’s orbit have reported.
But one thing he said, although ungrammatical, showed that he had learned a valuable lesson.
Others should take heed: “I can only warn people.
The more people that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.”

The Middle East’s Cold War
PRINCETON – The breach in diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a dangerous watershed in an already unstable, war-torn region.
The trigger was the execution by Saudi Arabia of Nimr al-Nimr, a firebrand Shia sheikh who had called for the end of the country’s monarchy.
But the rupture has its roots in a strategic rivalry that stretches across the Middle East.
The tensions between the two countries go back many decades, but they became especially acute after Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979.
The revolution’s leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, did not hide his contempt for the Saudi royal family; he quickly positioned Iran as a champion of “the oppressed” against “the forces of arrogance” – the United States and its local allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
But while the rivalry has sectarian and ideological components, it is, above all, a pragmatic dispute over regional interests.
Because Iran views the political order in the Arab world as serving its enemies’ interests, it has continuously sought to upend it, promoting terrorist groups and deploying proxies in order to establish and expand its influence in the region.
The non-state actors Iran has supported include rioting pilgrims in Mecca, suicide bombers in Lebanon, and Hezbollah militants, who have launched attacks on Israel and, more recently, battled Saudi-backed rebel groups in Syria.
Until the turn of the century, Saudi Arabia’s response was tepid; it sought to establish its Islamic legitimacy through strict enforcement of the religion’s dictates at home and support for Muslim liberation causes abroad, most notably in Afghanistan and Bosnia.
But in recent decades, the cold war between the two regional powers has heated up.
After the 2003 invasion of Iraq led to the formation of a Shia-dominated government in Baghdad, Saudi Arabia’s rulers watched in alarm as Iran extended its influence across the Middle East.
In 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill in Lebanon.
Then, in 2014, Shia Houthi rebels – another Iranian proxy group – conquered the capital of Yemen.
In the royal palaces in Riyadh, the prospect of Iranian-backed uprisings in Bahrain – or in Saudi Arabia itself – began to look alarmingly plausible.
Things came to a head in 2015, when the US and the other five permanent members of the UN Security Council (plus Germany) reached a nuclear accord with Iran, agreeing to lift economic sanctions while allowing the country to maintain its regional influence.
With Iranian allies or proxies operating in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, Saudi Arabia’s leaders have felt increasingly surrounded.
Since Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud’s accession to the throne in January 2015, the kingdom’s principal strategic aim has been to roll back Iran’s influence – with or without US help.
The rivalry’s principal battlegrounds are Syria and Yemen.
In Syria, Saudi Arabia has dedicated itself to the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad, a key Iranian ally, and has worked to unite the woefully disorganized opposition groups.
Iran, for its part, continues to back Assad, with the help of Russia.
The war has turned into a quagmire.
With no side able to gain the upper hand, the violence is likely to continue.
A recent US-led effort to broker a peace deal in Lebanon, carried out in the hope that this could lead to a breakthrough in Syria, fell victim to the distrust between the two countries.
The proposed power-sharing agreement would have replaced Assad with one of his allies and installed a long-time Saudi client as Prime Minister.
But while the Saudis appeared willing to accept the deal, Iran rejected it after Hezbollah balked at both candidates.
In Yemen, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies launched a military campaign in March 2015 that quickly ground down into another stalemate.
Pro-Iranian Houthi fighters and forces loyal to former President Ali Saleh have fought off a force of southern Yemenis backed by Saudi and Emirati air power and special forces.
Negotiations to resolve the conflict have collapsed.
In the absence of a full-scale invasion – which is not likely, given the potential for large-scale casualties – the war will almost certainly drag on.
Saudi Arabia’s execution of al-Nimr was part of a broader crackdown on domestic opposition; the sheikh was one of 47 people executed on charges of terrorism, all but four of them Sunni militants accused of supporting Al Qaeda.
The reaction of Iran and its supporters – with violent anti-Saudi protests not only in Tehran, where the kingdom’s embassy was sacked, but also in Iraq and Bahrain – merely revealed the full depth of the underlying bilateral enmity.
In the short term, Iran’s response has benefited Saudi Arabia’s rulers, rallying Sunnis both within the kingdom and abroad and silencing their jihadi opponents.
But without some external intervention to bring the two countries to the bargaining table, their rivalry will derail efforts to stabilize the Middle East and could lead to spillover and escalation, making a bad regional environment much worse.

Let Them Eat Respect?
PRINCETON – A few victories by center-left parties in large countries hardly makes for an international trend.
Nonetheless, wins by the US Democrats in 2020 and the German Social Democrats (SPD) in 2021 – not to mention a strong socialist performance in Portugal’s recent election – suggest that the much-discussed crisis of social democracy has not been fatal.
According to some center-left strategists, political renewal requires a turn away from anything that smacks of identity politics.
The fact that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s successful campaign theme was “respect” supposedly proves this.
The implication appears to be that the “working class” deserves priority over the recognition of ever-more assertive self-identified minorities.
And from this premise follows another argument that pundits have been making for years: the center left must win back votes from the far right, not only by refocusing on bread-and-butter issues, but also by making concessions to nationalist and anti-immigration sentiment (though this part usually isn’t said out loud).
But this premise is wrong, both empirically and morally, and parties that pursue such a strategy not only will fail to secure future majorities; they also will betray the core commitments that define the center left, and that younger voters take especially seriously.
To be sure, Scholz’s triumph last year seemed to vindicate former SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel, who warned in 2016 that “if you lose the workers of the Rust Belt, hipsters in California won’t save you.”
Scholz also took advice from Harvard political philosopher Michael Sandel, who has been urging the center left to abandon its fixation on meritocracy.
The idea is that political leaders should stop telling the proverbial “losers of globalization” that their failures are their own fault (or patronizingly suggesting that displaced blue-collar workers just need to move on and “learn to code”).
The mega-credentialed should acknowledge that their success is often the result of existing privileges and sheer luck, and that the less educated are owed more respect than they have received.
This approach aligns neatly with the insights of another famous academic: French economist Thomas Piketty, who argues that political competition in Western party systems now primarily plays out between two different elites: the “Brahmin Left” (highly educated “knowledge workers”) and the “Merchant Right” (business leaders and wealthy donors who support conservative parties and causes).
In this account, the working class is nowhere to be found.
Plenty of observers are confident that workers who feel ignored will inevitably become a far-right constituency – sometimes dubbed “working class parties 2.0.”
The lesson for the center left, then, is that it should become both post-neoliberal and post-meritocratic, sometimes offering tactical concessions to workers with authoritarian and anti-immigrant attitudes.
Yet as the social scientists Tarik Abou-Chadi, Reto Mitteregger, and Cas Mudde show, the assumptions underpinning this seductively simple formula are mistaken.
After all, there have always been authoritarian-leaning workers, and they have rarely if ever voted for center-left parties – not even during social democracy’s post-World War II heyday.
The working class has never been homogenous, and it has become even more diverse over time.
The archetypal white male steel worker is no longer remotely representative of this broader cohort.
The majority of service workers are female, and a significant share of them are women of color.
But even more striking, Abou-Chadi, Mitteregger, and Mudde point out that the majority of working-class voters in Western Europe – both in traditional production settings and in services – are not hostile to immigration.
While the far right has been doing better among workers in recent years – reaching beyond its traditional constituency of small-business owners and the self-employed – it still commands only around 15% of the total worker vote in Western European elections.
According to Abou-Chadi, Mitteregger, and Mudde, the far right has done much better with the low-educated voters who previously supported mainstream conservative parties or did not vote at all.
True, center-left parties have been losing ground in many democracies in recent decades.
But the main beneficiaries have been center-right and green parties, and it is the highly educated who are more likely to defect from traditional working-class parties.
With populations across the West becoming more educated and – gradually – more open-minded, appealing to an apocryphal white man who resents woke neoliberals is not a winning strategy.
Moreover, it is a mistake to view politics as being either about recognition of people’s dignity or material redistribution.
This is a false choice, and it is fanciful to think that politics in the past was purely about finding rational compromises among groups with competing economic interests.
Old-school socialists did not just lobby for higher pay; they also struggled for the affirmation of working people’s dignity.
Critics of identity politics claim that it is leading to a new form of feudalism, with the polity being sliced into “discrete subsets.”
And yet, their standard examples of identity politics – Black Lives Matter, #MeToo – are not really about separating society into groups whose lived experience is completely obscure to members of other groups.
After all, there is a strong emphasis on distribution: rights that many citizens take for granted – such as not being shot by police or raped by powerful people – need to be secured for everyone.
Young people are more sensitive to these challenges, and it is among younger cohorts, not older workers, that social democrats have been doing poorly in recent years.
According to Scholz’s advisers, he succeeded by insisting that no one should be considered “deplorable” – the now-infamous term that Hillary Clinton used to describe Donald Trump’s supporters in 2016.
True, equal respect is a basic element of democracy.
But that doesn’t mean far-right figures – the self-appointed representatives of the “deplorables” – are correct in suggesting that highly educated professionals spend most of their time sneering at the left-behind.
Reaching out to everyone is one thing; framing politics as a culture war between less-educated folks and supposedly disdainful elites is another thing entirely.
German Social Democrats did not “win back” voters from the far right, because their voters had never moved en masse in that direction.
By making concessions to the far right, center-left parties will only alienate the current and future demographic cohorts they need to win.

Whose Corporate Social Responsibility?
NEW YORK – Increasingly, corporations are under pressure, often from activist non-governmental organizations, to take on specific “corporate social responsibility” (CSR) obligations. But the fact that CSR is being demanded, and occasionally conceded, does not ensure clarity about either its rationale or the ways in which it should be undertaken.
CSR can be divided into two categories: what corporations should do (say, contribute to a women’s rights NGO or build a village school) and what they should not do (say, dump mercury into rivers or bury hazardous materials in landfills).
The latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation (and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host-country regulations).
But are CSR obligations really good practice?
Milton Friedman and other critics often asked if it was the business of businesses to practice corporate altruism.
Prior to the rise of the corporation, there were mainly family firms, such as the Rothschilds.
When they made money, it accrued principally to the family itself.
Altruism, where it existed, also was undertaken by the family, which decided how and on what to spend its money.
Whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point.
With the rise of the business corporation, large family firms have generally disappeared. But that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism – though its various stakeholders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altruistic ways.
Instead of CSR, we should have PSR (personal social responsibility).
One can also argue for PSR on the grounds that asking for CSR becomes a way of “passing the buck” – evading personal responsibility for doing good.
This is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years.
There is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR: there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism.
Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom, but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots. But PSR is more like President George H.W. Bush’s metaphor of a “thousand points of light.”
Moreover, it is hard to see how a corporation’s stakeholders can always arrive democratically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf.
Each will consider his or her CSR view the best.
But there are strong arguments in favor of CSR as well. First, the political reality is that society treats corporations as if they were persons, which is often also a legal reality for many purposes.
Society increasingly demands that these “corporate citizens” be altruistic, just as people are.
Given this reality, corporations want to give simply because it is expected of them.
Such CSR builds the firm’s image as a “good” corporation, just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as “good” billionaires.
Second, many corporations view CSR as an effective defensive strategy against powerful activist NGOs (such as Greenpeace) that have taken to using online agitation, boycotts, and other means to “blackmail” targeted corporations into acceding to the activists’ demands.
The more CSR a company can point to, the less such efforts will succeed – or even be mounted.
Consider the contrasting experiences of Coke and Pepsi.
Coke has been targeted by NGOs for alleged lapses in labor and environmental standards.
By contrast, Pepsi, which once teamed up with AT&T and the CIA to oust President Salvador Allende in Chile, smells like a rose nowadays, because it has distributed CSR largesse to several causes that influential NGOs embrace.
That is a lesson that Wal-Mart has since learned.
In 2005, the Service Employees’ International Union (SEIU) created Wal-Mart Watch, with an annual budget of $5 million.
The purpose was to make Wal-Mart a “better employer, neighbor, and corporate citizen,” and Wal-Mart eventually capitulated on some of the SEIU’s specific demands as well.
Finally, CSR can be simply a matter of advertising.
In this case, the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue, much like advertising, and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is.
A benign example is Adidas’s sponsorship of tennis tournaments.
A malign example is Philip Morris’s donation of money to museums, symphony orchestras, and opera houses, cynically aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes.
All these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine, just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual’s conscience and sense of what needs supporting.
The attempt by some NGOs and activists to impose a straitjacket on CSR, reflecting their priorities, is misguided and must be rejected.
Instead, the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan’s initiative, the Global Compact.
What Annan has done is to embrace ten wide-ranging guiding principles while leaving signatory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively.

JFK Reconsidered
CAMBRIDGE – November 22 will mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
For people alive at the time, it was one of those events that are so shocking that you remember where you were when you heard the news.
I was getting off a train in Nairobi when I saw the dramatic headline.
Kennedy was only 46 when he was killed in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald, a disgruntled former Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union.
Though his life had been plagued by illness, Kennedy projected an image of youth and vigor that added to the drama and poignancy of his death.
Martyrdom led many Americans to elevate Kennedy to the ranks of great presidents like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln; but historians have been more restrained in their evaluations.
Critics point to his sometimes reckless sexual behavior; to his scant legislative record; and to his failure to match words with deeds.
While Kennedy spoke about civil rights, tax cuts, and reducing poverty, it was his successor, Lyndon Johnson, who used Kennedy’s martyrdom and his own far more impressive political skills to pass historic legislation in these areas.
A 2009 poll of 65 American presidential scholars rated JFK as the sixth most important president, while a recent survey of British experts on American politics put Kennedy in 15th place.
Those are impressive rankings for a president who was in office for less than three years, but what did Kennedy really accomplish and how might history have been different if he had survived?
In my book Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era, I divide presidents into two categories: those who are transformational in their objectives, pursuing large visions related to major changes; and transactional leaders, who focus more on “operational” issues – ensuring that the metaphorical trains run on time (and stay on the tracks).
Because he was an activist and a great communicator with an inspirational style, Kennedy appeared to be a transformational president.
He campaigned in 1960 on a promise to “get the country moving again.”
Kennedy’s inaugural address appealed to sacrifice (“Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country”).
He established programs like the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and he set the United States on a path to landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960’s.
But, despite his activism and rhetoric, Kennedy was a cautious rather than an ideological personality.
As the presidential historian Fred Greenstein put it, “Kennedy had little in the way of an overarching perspective.”
Rather than being critical of Kennedy for not living up to his rhetoric, we should be grateful that in critical situations, he was prudent and transactional rather than ideological and transformational.
The most important achievement of Kennedy’s brief presidency was to manage the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and defuse what was probably the riskiest episode since the dawn of the nuclear age.
Kennedy certainly can be blamed for the bungled Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the subsequent Operation Mongoose – the covert CIA effort against the Castro regime that convinced the Soviet Union that its ally was under threat.
But Kennedy learned from his failure at the Bay of Pigs and created a careful process for managing the crisis that followed the Soviet Union’s placement of nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba.
Many of Kennedy’s advisers, as well as US military leaders, urged an air strike and invasion, which we now know might have led Soviet field commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons.
Instead, Kennedy played for time and kept his options open as he negotiated a stand-down with the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev.
Judging by Vice President Lyndon Johnson’s hawkish comments at the time, the outcome might have been far worse if Kennedy had not been president.
Moreover, Kennedy learned from the Cuban missile crisis as well; on June 10, 1963, he gave a speech aimed at easing Cold War tensions.
“I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men,” he said.
While a presidential vision of peace was not new, Kennedy followed it up by negotiating the first nuclear arms-control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty.
The great unanswered question about Kennedy’s presidency and how his assassination affected American foreign policy is what he would have done about the war in Vietnam.
When Kennedy became President, the US had a few hundred advisers in South Vietnam; he increased that number to 16,000.
Johnson eventually raised the number of US troops to more than 500,000.
Many Kennedy supporters claim that he would never have made such a mistake.
But he had supported a coup to replace South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem and left Johnson a deteriorating situation and a group of advisers who counseled against withdrawal.
Some fervent Kennedy supporters – for example, the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Kennedy’s speechwriter, Theodore Sorensen – have written that Kennedy planned to withdraw from Vietnam after he won re-election in 1964, and claim that Kennedy told Senator Mike Mansfield that that was his plan.
But skeptics point out that Kennedy always spoke publicly about the need to prevail in Vietnam.
The question remains open.
In my view, Kennedy was a good but not a great president.
What made him good was not merely his ability to inspire others, but his prudence when it came to complex foreign-policy decisions.
We are fortunate that he was more often transactional than transformational in foreign policy.
We are unfortunate that we lost him after only a thousand days.

How Europe Can Sustain Russia Sanctions
MADRID – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine is a dramatic wake-up call for Europe.
The European Union can no longer be a passive player in global affairs.
It must reinforce its own security structure within the broader context of NATO.
The COVID-19 crisis offers important lessons in this regard.
The intuition behind Europe’s response to the pandemic was that a common, symmetric, external shock to economic policymaking called for common, internally coherent, and consensual solutions.
This translated into a political agreement to create a centralized spending initiative financed with funds raised by the European Commission.
The new Recovery and Resilience Facility provided EU member states with the means – including through fiscal transfers – to respond to the health crisis and its economic consequences.
In the face of Putin’s blitz, Europe urgently needs a similar mechanism to finance investment in its long-term safety, and to help member states bear the economic cost of enacting meaningful sanctions against Russia.
The steps needed to secure Europe geopolitically will be costly, and they will go beyond simply supporting our aging military forces.
Part of the cost will stem from the effects of sanctions, and part from the need to adapt to the new geopolitical environment.
Not all EU members have enough fiscal capacity to absorb these costs.
Some (such as Italy) have much higher levels of public debt, and others (such as Germany) are more exposed to the rebound effects of sanctions.
Moreover, no EU member can feasibly pursue rapid and full diversification away from Russian gas.
As former Russian President Dmitri Medvedev has threatened, Europeans face the prospect of skyrocketing gas prices.
And with Ukraine and Russia together accounting for almost 30% of global wheat exports, food also will be affected worldwide – a problem compounded by an increase in the price of fertilizers, of which Russia is a major producer.
The downside risks to the economy will therefore include new inflationary pressures on top of those associated with the post-pandemic reopening.
Facing the specter of stagflation, the European Central Bank may feel more pressure to tighten monetary policy.
If so, the expectation of rate increases might in turn force some countries into fiscal tightening, which would render meaningful additional security spending all but impossible.
Nonetheless, a united Europe is needed now more than ever to maintain sufficiently severe sanctions against Russia, and to mitigate the short-term pain from Russian counter-sanctions.
With European gas storage facilities still 30% full, and with the possibility of receiving additional liquefied natural gas (LNG), Europe can survive the winter even with an interruption of all Russian gas flows.
But to manage this worst-case scenario, European countries will need to show solidarity by sharing scarce resources with those most in need, and by extending EU financial support to the most-affected countries.
After that, two more measures will be needed to ensure longer-term solidarity on energy issues.
First, EU countries must (finally) build the gas interconnections that are needed to make the EU energy market more flexible and resilient to shocks.
For example, pipelines connecting Spain and France would enable the rest of Europe to tap into Iberia’s large LNG infrastructure.
Second, EU countries must turn gas storage into a strategic asset.
The companies that own storage sites should be required to fill them up ahead of winter, and EU member states should consider developing a regional strategic gas storage system like the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Europe also needs to prepare itself to welcome war refugees.
A mechanism will be needed for distributing potentially millions of refugees within the Union, and for supporting host countries financially.
One possible blueprint is the EU’s Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) initiative, which was rolled out during the pandemic to reinforce national social-security systems.
Moreover, Western companies and financial institutions hit hard by the effects of the war and new sanctions must not suffer liquidity crises.
The Russian economy is likely to be abruptly disconnected from Western markets, and the Ukrainian economy will deteriorate fast.
Many Western companies will be exposed to these developments and will need time and support to refocus their assets and business plans.
Europe’s response here should include activating new state aid exceptions under articles 107(3) and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
But it must not stop there.
As in the COVID-19 crisis, a straightforward suspension of the state-aid framework could produce a scenario in which rich countries are able to shield their markets much more than poorer countries can, undermining competition in the internal market.
Europe therefore needs a facility to provide equal backing to all affected companies and financial institutions.
Finally, we cannot shy away from updating the aging European military infrastructure.
In the past, EU countries have benefited from joint military procurement on specific projects through the European Defence Agency.
This approach now needs to be scaled up substantially and backed by common resources, with guidelines that all assets purchased be used to reform and modernize the national units participating in EU-level defense through EU Battlegroup or NATO assignments.
The COVID-19 Recovery and Resilience Facility was successful because it accounted for different interests in the name of fighting a common problem.
It should now be augmented with a security facility to provide financial support for the difficult measures that will be needed to sustain a united front vis-à-vis Russia.
In addition to loans to deal with short-term issues such as illiquidity, there should be common spending to finance structural adaptation over the medium term, especially to support defense spending, refugee resettlement, and the energy transition.
Accordingly, the facility should be financed with EU bonds, which should be eligible for purchase by the ECB – thus also serving as a much-needed EU safe asset.
The Russia-Ukraine crisis will require rethinking how European countries allocate their budgets and govern key sectors, some of which are only loosely connected with defense and security.
This transition is not a choice, but rather a necessary response to dark times.

Bad Financial Moon Rising
BASEL – No one should overestimate economists’ powers of understanding.
Just as the magnitude of the global downturn that began in mid-2008 took most economists completely by surprise, so did the sclerotic nature of the recovery.
Similarly, economic forecasts today appear to be nothing more than hopeful extrapolations of recent growth.
In reality, all is not well beneath the surface.
Should another financial crisis materialize, the subsequent recession might be even costlier than the last one, not least because policymakers will face unprecedented economic and political constraints in responding to it.
Some take comfort in post-crisis improvements to global financial regulation, on the assumption that these measures will prevent financial distress from spilling over into the real economy.
This is an ill-advised stance.
The analytical foundations of many of these “improvements” appear shaky, and the challenges of implementing the new regulatory regime have proven formidable.
Perhaps most important, ultra-easy monetary policies have encouraged precisely the risky financial behavior that regulations were supposed to limit.
With monetary policy firmly on the accelerator, and regulatory policies firmly on the brake, the likeliest result is heightened instability.
The most worrisome side effect of recent monetary policies has been a continuous increase in the ratio of non-financial debt to global GDP.
Though the 2008 crisis offered an opportunity for deleveraging, the opposite has happened.
Debt has piled up worldwide, with the biggest increases found in emerging-market private sectors.
The recovery in emerging-market economies was supposed to be part of the post-crisis solution. Now, these economies are part of the problem.
The fact that much of this dollar-denominated debt has been issued by non-US residents means that another costly currency-mismatch crisis could be in store.
In addition to ballooning global debt levels, sky-high property prices seem to be heading for a turn, and “risk-free” long-term rates remain unusually low in many countries.
Very low credit risk and term spreads, along with record-low measures of volatility, have invited still more risky behavior.
Should these spreads normalize, the risks would come home to roost.
The record-high percentage of “covenant-lite” new loans (lacking many basic protections for the lender) further attests to excessive risk-taking.
Of course, it also implies that recovery rates on bad loans (and associated collateralized loan obligations) could be unexpectedly high.
The fact that asset-management companies and private-equity firms have increasingly displaced regulation-constrained banks as lenders has made it increasingly difficult to see what is actually going on, and to anticipate how future financial retrenchment might play out, particularly with respect to emerging markets.
Should financial markets begin to tighten, either spontaneously or in response to tighter monetary conditions, there is good reason to worry about overshooting.
Owing to the major central banks’ unconventional monetary policies over the past decade, the process of “price discovery” in financial markets has long been curtailed.
At this point, even “efficient” financial markets would struggle to adapt to normalization.
And there have been many indications of financial-market inefficiency in recent years, including continuing anomalies such as the violation of covered interest parity conditions in foreign-exchange markets, bouts of reduced liquidity (partly owing to new regulations), and recurrent flash crashes.
And to these “known knowns” we must add the “known unknowns” associated with algorithmic trading and passive investing.
A final major risk to the global economy is US President Donald Trump’s administration, whose protectionist policies are threatening to slow real (inflation-adjusted) growth and drive up inflation.
And while fiscal expansion in the United States might temporarily offset growth impediments, it, too, will exacerbate inflationary pressures and undermine longer-term debt sustainability.
Moreover, both protectionism and fiscal expansion are strengthening the dollar, and thus squeezing US exporters and foreigners who have borrowed in dollars.
Complicating matters further, Trump’s statement that he is not “thrilled” at the prospect of higher interest rates points to the risk of a too-compliant Federal Reserve ending up behind the inflationary curveball.
When that happens, a recession typically follows.
Lastly, the Trump administration is increasingly using the dollar – and access to dollar clearing and funding – as a geopolitical weapon, risking retaliation and perhaps even jeopardizing the future of the dollar-based global monetary system.
All of these risks are raising the likelihood of a mass “hunkering down” in the face of future shocks.
Worse, should the global economy experience another significant downturn, policymakers will find it much harder to respond than they did before.
Initially low policy rates mean that central banks will have very little room for traditional monetary easing.
As for unconventional monetary policies, there is still much disagreement about their effectiveness.
At any rate, new measures would imply further increasing central banks’ balance sheets, which many (not least in Central Europe) already consider to be a potential source of future inflation.
Likewise, regardless of their merits, fiscal policies will almost certainly be constrained by leaders’ fears of rapidly rising sovereign debt, especially in the major advanced economies.
Another bank bailout would of course produce a severe political backlash.
But even if the Fed was willing to risk it, provisions in the 2010 US Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation explicitly limit its discretion in such matters.
Whether those provisions apply to the Fed’s technical capacity to provide dollars to foreign central banks – as it did on a massive scale in late 2008 – remains to be seen.
An even bigger political constraint has emerged in the last decade.
Whereas the 2008 crisis was a global phenomenon that elicited a global response, the growth of nationalist sentiment in many countries would likely impede similar cooperation.
Would the US Congress now allow the Fed to lend trillions of dollars to “freeloading foreigners”?
Add to that the rise of China and India, and the US role in global leadership is less clear-cut than it was a decade ago.
If another economic downturn were to fuel further nationalist gains and faster erosion of international cooperation, we could find ourselves on an old, familiar, and extremely dangerous path.

Asia and a Post-American Middle East
KUWAIT CITY – When the consequences of the United States-led invasion of Iraq ten years ago are fully assessed, the importance of the subsequent rise of political Islam there – and throughout the wider Middle East – may well pale in comparison to that of a geostrategic shift that no one foresaw at the time. That shift, however, has now come into view.
The Middle East, of course, has experienced the withdrawal of a great power, or powers, many times before: the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire after World War I; the fraying of the French and British imperial mandates after World War II; and, most recently, the nearly complete disappearance of Russian influence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Each time, monumental changes in the region’s politics, particularly its alliances, quickly followed.
If America attempts to wash its hands of the Middle East in the coming years, will a similar rupture be inevitable?
Although many believe that the US-Israel alliance is the foundation of America’s Middle East policy, it was dependence on imported oil that motivated the US to establish a dominant military presence in the region after 1945.
Indeed, until the Six Day War of June 1967, the US was not a major supplier of military hardware to Israel.
America’s military presence was intended, above all, to preserve the Arab status quo, and hence the flow of energy from the Persian Gulf, for the benefit of the US, its allies, and the entire global economy.
Of course, no one should think that America’s shale-gas revolution (which has brought it to the brink of energy self-sufficiency) means that its Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet will lift anchor any time soon.
But the rationale for America’s commitment of military force to the region is changing fast; when that happens – as it has in Europe, for example, since the Cold War’s end – the distribution of military assets tends to change as well.
That change is almost certain to be reflected in America’s relationships with its Arab allies and partners.
As the US statesman/academic Joseph Nye has argued: “For decades the United States and Saudi Arabia have had a balance of asymmetries in which we depended on them as the swing producer of oil and they depended on us for ultimate military security.”
Given America’s burgeoning domestic energy supplies, Nye argues, those “bargains will be struck on somewhat better terms,” at least from the US perspective.
But, whatever new terms are struck, the degree of US disengagement from the Middle East will depend on how two key questions are answered.
First, would even a partial withdrawal of military force create a security vacuum that could be filled by a rival – say, China or Iran?
And, second, would any diminution of America’s commitment to the region incite the kind of instability that breeds failed states and terrorist havens?
President Barack Obama’s current security strategy in Afghanistan, Yemen, and elsewhere suggests that the US will seek to mitigate the latter risk by continuing its covert interventions – particularly its use of unmanned aerial vehicles.
Preventing rivals from gaining overweening influence in the region, however, will require a very different type of response – one that will require the backing of old allies, such as Japan, and new friends, like India.
The reason for this is clear: China’s dependence on Middle East energy imports means that it is almost certain to seek to fill any regional security vacuum.
Indeed, China appears to have long anticipated the coming changes in the region’s security structure, and already seems prepared to take advantage of them if permitted to do so.
Its “string of pearls” across the Indian Ocean – a series of potential naval stations connecting China to the Middle East and Africa – would support a Chinese blue-water navy able to patrol the sea-lanes of the Persian Gulf.
But, in trying to strike new bargains with Middle East oil producers, China has already been compromised by its strong backing of Iran, which is locked in a power struggle with the region’s leading Sunni states, particularly Saudi Arabia.
Absent a complete shift in China’s relations with Iran, a strategic partnership with the monarchies of the Persian Gulf may prove impossible to achieve. And, even then, China’s domestic repression of Xinjiang’s Muslims, which provoked a fierce dispute with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan just a few years ago, may preclude the necessary trust from ever taking root.
Still, China’s inevitable bid for greater influence in the Middle East means that countries like India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Turkey and others will also need to become proactive in creating a regional security structure that protects their national interests.
They will need to be clear with themselves about whether they have the means to achieve their national security ends.
For example, could they provide some of the security that America has long provided to the region’s Arab states?
Such a projection of Asian power – and of Asia’s power struggles – into the Middle East may seem a distant prospect today.
But ten years ago, so did the possibility of an American disengagement from the region.

Cheap Oil for Change
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent decline in oil prices is likely to have a major, largely positive impact on the global economy – even greater than most observers seem to recognize.
Indeed, if governments take advantage of lower oil prices today to implement critical energy-policy reforms, the benefits may improve structural features of their economies tomorrow.
A key reason why the price decline’s impact has so far been underestimated is that nobody knows how long it will last.
And, indeed, past price movements provide little guidance in this regard.
When prices plunged in 2008, they shot back up almost faster than experts could say “new normal”; after the 1986-1987 drop, prices remained low for a decade and a half.
This time, the price trajectory is likely to be determined by a new player in the energy game: shale oil.
The marginal cost of shale-oil production (the expense of continuing to pump an existing well) varies from $55 to $70 per barrel.
Add a $5 profit margin, and the oil-supply curve now has a long, near-horizontal segment in the range of about $60-75 per barrel.
Regardless of demand, this will be the natural nesting range for the price of oil – call it the “shale shelf” – and will likely remain in place for a protracted period.
This provides some insight into OPEC’s decision last November not to curtail supply.
Saudi Arabia correctly reasoned that cutting output would not boost prices, but simply concede space for new players to step in and grab market share.
Of course, this pattern could be disrupted, if, say, a war or major conflict in an oil-exporting region constrained supply enough to cause prices to spike beyond the shale shelf.
But, in the absence of a major unexpected shock, oil companies will remain under pressure to continue selling oil, even at low prices, as they struggle to service the large debts they incurred on investments when oil prices were high.
This pressure is precisely what drove oil prices so low in December and January.
Given this, it is reasonable to expect the oil supply to remain plentiful, and prices to remain moderate, through 2016 – a trend that will boost global growth by an estimated 0.5 percentage points over this period.
The impact will be especially large for countries like India and Indonesia, where the bill for oil imports amounts to as much as 7.5% of GDP.
In fact, India’s current account, which has been in deficit for years, is likely to record a surplus this year.
This creates a unique opportunity for energy-policy reform.
In far too many countries, fuel is heavily subsidized, straining government budgets and encouraging wasteful consumption.
Low oil prices offer an ideal opening to reduce subsidies, thereby releasing funds that governments can spend on basic services and social-welfare programs that advance poverty reduction.
But advising countries simply to lower subsidies is often meaningless.
In countries where the government dictates gas prices – like India and Indonesia did until recently (and, to some extent, continue to do) – lower market prices would reduce the subsidy automatically.
That is why holding down subsidies is inadequate for such countries.
The goal should be to shift from a fixed-price system, with occasional government-decreed adjustments, to a market-based price regime, in which the government makes a credible pledge not to limit prices, with the exception of pre-defined extreme circumstances.
While such a move would have a negligible effect on prices now, it would provide countries with a huge advantage during future oil-price fluctuations, because consumers and retail suppliers would no longer be cut off from price signals.
Amid all of this good news, two serious concerns stand out.
In the short run, declining oil prices create grave challenges for those who, having invested in expanding production when prices were high, now face large costs and failing businesses.
More problematic, lower oil prices encourage excessive consumption – the long-term environmental impact of which will be compounded by the weakening incentive to invest in alternative energy sources.
Policymakers must recognize these risks, and implement policies to mitigate them.
Specifically, governments should divert the money they save on oil and subsidies to targeted programs aimed at helping people escape poverty, and they should incorporate into their tax regimes incentives for innovation and investment in clean energy.
With the correct approach, today’s oil-price volatility could turn out to be a critical turning point on the path toward a more sustainable future, characterized by shared prosperity and genuine progress on poverty reduction.
The direction to take is clear.

The Déjà-Vu Virus?
PARIS – The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating three fundamental geopolitical trends: the rise of Asia, the decline of the United States, and the strengthening of Germany within Europe.
Combined, these shifts may well prefigure the world of 2030. But, before then, political leaders must overcome the current crisis – and not repeat the catastrophic errors of a century ago.
Today, the future and the past seem to be colliding.
Now that COVID-19 has brutally thrust much of the world into the digital economy, many people will not wish to return to the pre-pandemic world as if what we are now experiencing had been a mere blip.
The virus does not signify the end of globalization, but it probably is a bad omen for a certain variety of it.
For example, will leaders still want to attend the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos and mingle in a dense crowd of peers, rather than networking in ways that respect social-distancing norms in the face of a deadly virus?
But above all, the pandemic is confirming the ascent of Asia – not just China – and the decline of the West, and the US in particular.
By far the world’s strongest military power, America was singularly disarmed when confronted with the novel coronavirus.
The country’s health-care system could not cope with the scale of the pandemic (although the US is hardly alone in that regard), while the long lines of people patiently waiting to receive food handouts evoked images of the Great Depression prior to the New Deal.
And America’s political leaders, caricatures of brutality and opportunism, simply made things worse, further tarnishing the country’s international image in the process.
True, America may recover part of its dignity and humanity by tossing President Donald Trump aside in November’s presidential election. But that will require Democrats to unite behind their presumptive nominee, Joe Biden, as former president Barack Obama emphasized when recently endorsing him.
Biden has a real chance of winning.
US voters may well punish Republicans for their blundering response to the pandemic and the consequent economic devastation, just as South Korean voters recently rewarded President Moon Jae-in’s ruling party with an absolute parliamentary majority, following his administration’s so-far successful efforts to contain the coronavirus.
But even if Trump is defeated, America will not recover the central global position it previously occupied for three-quarters of a century.
America’s decline, however, does not mean that China will carry the global torch.
COVID-19 has just as ruthlessly exposed China’s flaws, including its government’s lack of transparency.
The outbreak there fueled a dramatic economic collapse in the first quarter of 2020, and the country remains vulnerable to a second wave of the pandemic.
All this suggests that the world may be becoming non-polar, rather than bipolar.
Moreover, neither Russia nor the European Union can pretend to fill the gap at the top.
Like Iran and Turkey, Russia may well emerge weaker from the crisis.
In fact, President Vladimir Putin may have far more to fear from COVID-19 than he does from Russia’s enfeebled opposition parties.
What about Europe?
After a very uncertain initial response to the pandemic – to put it mildly – the EU seems to be regaining some clout thanks to a trio of women leaders: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.
But this crisis has mainly demonstrated Germany’s strength rather than Europe’s resilience.
Despite being Europe’s most populous country, Germany has registered at least four times fewer deaths than its main EU peers, while Merkel, who until recently was widely seen as a lame-duck leader, enjoys higher trust ratings than any other European leader.
She has proven that a politician can follow their ethical instincts – as she did in opening Germany’s borders to migrants in 2015 – and still be seen five years later as the best protection against fear and uncertainty.
If history is indeed accelerating as a result of COVID-19, we still have to look to the past to draw the right lessons.
And the pivotal year in that regard is 1920.
A century ago, in the immediate aftermath of World War I and the devastating Spanish flu pandemic, political leaders proved incapable of finding the right answers to the huge challenges they faced.
As a result, the world fell first into the Great Depression and then into World War II.
Today’s leaders are confronted by different but equally daunting challenges.
In particular, they have to strike a delicate balance not only between protecting their citizens’ lives and restarting the economy, but also between liberty and security.
If governments go too far in prioritizing the economy over public health, they run the risk of a second COVID-19 wave that would have devastating consequences for both.
Likewise, if they champion liberty above all else, and ignore the contribution of tracking technologies to taming the pandemic in Asia, they risk that one day, less prudent and moderate political forces may apply libertarian principles brutally and with total disregard for public welfare.
In the 1920s and 1930s, pacifism born out of a terrible war contributed to the victory of fascism and an even more horrific global conflict.
Today, we must not allow economic greed or libertarianism to take us down an equally disastrous path.

Europe in the Back Seat
MADRID – Reform of global economic governance is still firmly on the radar screens of policymakers, but there is little evidence that the European Union has developed a forward-looking or coherent approach to the new forms that the G-20 is committed to establishing.
The G-20, which will hold its next summit in South Korea in November, pledged that multilateral cooperation and interdependence would guide the world out of crisis.
Most European policies, however, do not sit well with the spirit of such commitments.
The EU may not have imposed sweeping quotas and tariffs, but powerful “behind the border” protectionism has emerged in the form of subsidies, bailouts, “buy national” injunctions, and new restrictions on foreign direct investment.
Global Trade Alert, an independent monitor, has identified more than 300 new protectionist measures introduced by G-20 members.
Since the G-20’s promise last year to move towards concluding the Doha Round of global trade negotiations, the EU has done nothing practical to achieve this goal.
It declined to introduce measures aimed at improving OECD rules to free up investment flows, and the new European Commission led by José Manuel Barroso includes fewer pro-market members than during his first term.
Most commissioners now seem to advocate relaxing state-aid rules to fund investment in R&D; so, even if we have not witnessed an open dismantling of the Single Market, it is certainly not moving forward.
European governments, moreover, have used the G-20 in a highly instrumental fashion, with the largest share of the bailout funds agreed under the G-20 rubric having gone to middle-income states in or around Europe.
Not only is the EU over-represented in the G-20, but it also seems to have used the forum as a means of tapping into emergency funds to further its own interests, rather than as a genuine step towards broader and more balanced multilateral cooperation.
The large number of EU countries in the G-20 serves little purpose in the absence of systematic coordination of member states and Commission positions.
The EU has had little to say, for example, about what kind of governance rules and standards should guide debates over the much-needed rebalancing between surplus and deficit states.
Instead, each member state has grabbed whatever measure of flexibility assists its own immediate economic recovery.
Growth will no longer be generated from the West on the back of emerging-economy surpluses, but will need to come from within the emerging world itself, which should be nudged away from purely export-oriented economic policies.
But EU influence over Chinese revaluation has been zero.
This must change.
Taken together, all these shortcomings cast serious doubt on the EU’s claim to be leading the debate over a fundamental reshaping of global economic governance.
European governments repeat the mantra of “effective multilateralism,” but they seem to have no comprehensive strategy for translating this into coherent policy.
Indeed, when Europeans think about reforming global governance, they limit themselves to numbers of seats and voting weights in international bodies.
European governments are only now reluctantly accepting the need to scale back their over-representation in multilateral bodies, recognizing that it undermines rather than enhances the EU’s overall influence by pushing other powers into separate arrangements.
But, while deliberation is taking place on how much Europe should retreat from its historical domination of multilateral bodies, there is little vision beyond this.
For example, the financial crisis has not forced member states to converge their national systems of financial regulation, an omission that militates against a common European vision for remodeled global financial cooperation.
In the wake of the crisis, the EU has instead decided to prioritize key bilateral relationships.
It has launched strategic partnerships with Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the US, the African Union, and NATO.
Most of these partnerships have little geopolitical content, and their sheer number debases their importance in the eyes of partners.
A raft of new bilateral trade agreements is also being negotiated.
The rush to bilateral agreements is perhaps understandable in the quest for rapid results and a greater sense of control over international trends.
But the costs are high, insofar as such agreements undercut the very multilateralism that in general serves the EU well.
How can the EU expect other powers to apply multilateral principles that it ignores?
The rest of the world increasingly sees the EU’s multilateralism as a means of legitimizing European intervention in the affairs of weaker states and excluding rising powers’ involvement in European affairs.
European powers have been just as mercurial in their alliance-building as any supposedly less principled powers.
As the dust settles from the shock waves of the financial crisis, and with trends pointing towards the US-China axis as the key motor of the global economy, Europe is clearly in a more defensive frame of mind.
Far from shaping the contours of a new balanced structure of global governance, the EU has been reduced to taking a series of rearguard positions aimed at tempering its own loss of stature.
The EU appears to have decided that the world will be one of Great Power rivalry, and that this requires a power-politics approach to global governance.
In fact, many different dynamics co-exist and are still in flux; the EU still has the chance to shape the emerging post-Western world order, rather than accepting its parameters with passive resignation.
But Europe risks being too servile in courting new alliances, fixated as it is on short-term gain – and bereft of any clear idea of how such alliances fit with the kinds of values that it believes should guide revised global governance.
France, when it assumes leadership of the G-20 after the Seoul summit, must move quickly to redress these shortcomings.

From Nuclear Safety to Nuclear Security
WASHINGTON, DC/MOSCOW – Four years ago, a devastating tsunami crashed into the coast of Japan.
Fifty-foot waves breached the seawall of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, cutting off its emergency power supply and disabling its cooling systems.
The nuclear accident was the worst since the meltdown of the Chernobyl power plant in 1986.
Investigators concluded that one of the underlying causes was complacency: those in charge of the facility believed that their safety systems were robust, and there was no effective independent oversight.
The disaster in Japan has spurred reforms in the field of nuclear safety. But when it comes to nuclear security, complacency remains a major problem.
We must not wait until tragedy strikes to do something about it.
Today, well over 1.5 million kilograms of highly enriched uranium and plutonium – key ingredients for nuclear weapons – are dispersed across hundreds of facilities in 25 countries.
Some are poorly secured.
Yet enough nuclear material to fill a small bag of sugar is all it takes to construct a device with the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of people and inflict billions of dollars in damage.
Much has been done to improve security at nuclear facilities in recent years, but governments must do more to protect their citizens from the risks of catastrophic nuclear terrorism.
The lessons from the Fukushima crisis can serve as a useful guide for reform.
For starters, governments and industry must treat nuclear security as a process of continuous improvement and work to keep pace with evolving threats and challenges.
A facility considered secure 20 years ago might now be vulnerable to a cyber attack that bypasses its security systems or confounds efforts to keep track of its nuclear material.
Well-organized and well-financed non-state groups, like the Islamic State, may employ new tactics, technologies, and capabilities to steal nuclear materials.
Governments must therefore consistently evaluate evolving technologies and threats so that security systems designed to protect nuclear materials stay ahead of the capabilities of those who would seek to steal them.
Second, governments and industry should make sure that security culture, like safety culture, becomes an integral part of every nuclear facility’s operations.
As General Eugene Habiger, a former commander-in-chief of the United States Strategic Command who was the US Department of Energy’s “security czar,” once put it: “Good security is 20% equipment and 80% people.”
Governments and industry should work together to nurture a strong culture of security.
Each and every employee at a nuclear facility – from guards to scientists to senior staff – must view the security of nuclear materials as an essential part of their jobs.
Third, governments must regularly review security systems at nuclear facilities.
It is not sufficient for nuclear operators to say that the state of security in their facilities is “good enough.”
Effective oversight can root out complacency.
Fukushima exposed the need for regulators to perform regular stress tests, evaluating the ability of nuclear facilities to stand up to various contingencies affecting their safety.
Regulators should conduct similar evaluations aimed specifically at assessing facilities’ ability to withstand security threats, including theft by knowledgeable insiders.
Finally, world leaders should seek to establish closer forms of international cooperation on nuclear security.
As Chernobyl and Fukushima demonstrated, nuclear safety vulnerabilities in one country can have profound consequences for the rest of the world. The same can be said of nuclear security risks.
We share a political – and moral – responsibility to ensure that terrorists never get their hands on the world’s most dangerous materials.
Countries should draw on the example of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, a successful program of collaboration on nuclear security among the United States, Russia, and ex-Soviet states.
Countries with nuclear materials should exchange information on how best to bolster security, increase intelligence-sharing on common nuclear-security challenges, and explore the possibility of conducting peer reviews.
Our friend and colleague Sam Nunn, co-chairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, often warns that we are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe.
It is important that we learn the lessons of Fukushima and incorporate them into our strategy to combat nuclear terrorism.
This is one race in which we cannot afford to fall behind.

The Transatlantic Blame Game
As if the diplomatic spat over Iraq weren't bad enough, relations between America and Europe are being slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies.
Indeed, the differences between the two sides' economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades.
At first glance, the depth of this ``policy gap'' seems surprising.
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe.
Moreover, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery.
But their governments' actions--or lack of action--make it seem as if neither side can see the problems faced by the other.
When the Euro was introduced, most EU members--Germany, in particular--looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure.
Thus, today's framework in Euro area, with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy, was not constructed to facilitate macroeconomic coordination with the US.
But the perception of many American observers was different.
They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to junk its supposed role as a ``free rider'' in the international economy, one that left the US shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth.
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America.
These two views were bound to conflict, and now they do.
Tensions hidden during the long Clinton-era boom rose throughout 2001, when America tried to address its economic downturn by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies.
As big budget deficits returned, so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America's mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar.
American critics, meanwhile, saw the Euro area as overly cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Initially, the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted.
Subsequently, they were constrained by the limits to their fiscal reactions embodied in the Maastricht Treaty; the large economies of Continental Europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of good growth.
Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe did not help much to redress America's external imbalance.
Of course, the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America.
But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration: the issues confronting the European economies are different from those facing the US--as are perceptions about the challenges.
In fact, the main reasons for the massive swing in US public finances--from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4% in 2003-04--have little to do with stabilization.
Aside from the costs of the Iraq war and other security concerns, along with lapses in earlier spending controls, US tax cuts have structural and distributional rather than short-term aims.
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent, whose spending is less sensitive to taxes.
The cuts should sustain private demand this year and next, but at the cost of postponing improvements in private saving and indebtedness.
Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year, continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5% of GDP.
As the deficit widens further, dollar depreciation will likely resume, despite laggardly performances by the world's other major economies.
Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth?
Probably not.
The counterpart to the US emphasis on self-reliance rather than direct public assistance is that employment must be maintained at high levels--regardless of the party in power--whereas most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8% or more.
So the US is likely to opt for growth.
Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe's largest economies is currently smaller than in the US.
Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable, given high rates in Europe's largest economies.
But tax cuts that must soon be reversed--due mainly to demographic pressure on public pensions and healthcare--are unlikely to stimulate demand as consumers lose confidence in government's ability to control deficits.
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, not inflation.
The EU countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too entrenched, as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labor market.
Further dollar depreciation as well as slower US growth will undermine EU exports, the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe.
The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so.
But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation, potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war.
If so, the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer.
Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic.
The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit, while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU.
It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly.

A Saudi Asks, "Why?"
A journalist visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently asked me why five out of six students he interviewed at King Saud University still believe that Al Qaida was not responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in America last year?
Dealing with this question is increasingly frustrating for me, because I have run out of plausible explanations.
I used to believe that denial of Saudi complicity in the attacks reflected our distress with what happened on that dark day.
I hoped that we would have the courage to overcome our perceived humiliation and start looking deep into our national psyche, asking the big question, "Why did 15 of our young men attack America in so brutal a way?"
So far, we are no closer than we were after the attack to answering to this question, because we cannot even find the nerve to ask it.
Had we been more confident and less full of bluster, we would have organized seminar after seminar to analyze what happened, to understand the reasons behind it, and to plan for a future without a similar tragedy.
After all, Osama bin Laden's hijacked planes not only attacked New York and Washington, they also attacked Islam as a faith and the values of tolerance and coexistence that it preaches.
But despite the enormity of what happened, we remain in denial.
We still cling to conspiracy theories even after bin Laden and his fellow conspirators bragged about their great "achievement."
We continue to close our eyes to the fact that 19 young Muslim men decided to leave home, head for what they described as jihad, and became criminals.
It is past time to move forward.
We must admit that 15 Saudis helped perpetrate the attacks on America of last September 11th, and that hundreds of other Saudis were needlessly killed far away from home, in the mountains and villages of Afghanistan.
We must uncover why Taliban-ruled Afghanistan seemed such an attractive destination for a significant portion of Saudi youth in the years before September 11th.
Afghanistan was a country where Muslims were killing each other.
Any Muslim knew that his duty in this case was to try to reconcile the combatants, not join the violence.
When Arabs, including Saudis, first fought in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s, their campaign was politically and religiously just.
Afghan Muslims were confronting foreign aggressors who sought to impose Soviet-style communism upon them.
The Mujahideen were overseen by responsible clerics, who gave a shining example to Saudi youth.
Some of those young men remained in Afghanistan as Mujahideen entered Kabul to take part in the bitter infighting that led to the Taliban's rise.
Others returned home and were welcomed as heroes.
Were those young men who returned home then wiser than today's Saudi youth?
What happened in the last ten years that allowed extremists to find so many eager followers?
Since September 11th we have busied ourselves counseling the Americans, pointing out where they went wrong, but no one is listening.
Instead, we should be remedying our own deficiencies. We should be trying to answer the question that the Americans have been asking us incessantly: why did young Saudi men take part in the attacks?
We must answer this question not for the Americans' sake, but for our own.
It is not enough to say that the hijackers--and, indeed, the many Saudis being held at Guantanamo Bay--represent a subset of duped youngsters and that the rest of Saudi youth are different.
That is true, of course, but the damage that this relatively small group inflicted was monumental.
It is far better to try and understand their motives.
In our attempts to defend and justify ourselves over the past year, we Saudis learned about the consequences of extremism at Waco, Texas and Oklahoma City.
We wrote about the Michigan Militia and other American radical extremists.
Of course there is extremism in America--extremism as ugly as any that we have at home. But the Americans studied and analyzed minutely the Waco and Oklahoma City incidents on their own.
The motives behind those attacks were examined in an effort to guarantee that such events would not recur.
We Saudis have failed to do the same.
The most pressing issue now is to ensure that our children are never influenced by extremist ideas like those that misled 15 of our countrymen into hijacking four planes that fine September day, piloting them, and us, straight into the jaws of hell.

The Next Phase of Finance
WASHINGTON, DC – The decade since the global financial crisis has been tumultuous, to say the least.
True, no great war has erupted, and we have more or less avoided the mistakes of the Great Depression, which led in the 1930s to greater protectionism, bank failures, severe austerity, and a deflationary environment.
But renewed market tensions indicate that these risks have not been eradicated so much as papered over.
In a sense, the story of the 2008 financial crisis begins when the global order was created from the ashes of World War II.
Initiatives like the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), the Marshall Plan, and the European Economic Community supported the reconstruction of significant portions of the world economy.
Despite the Cold War (or perhaps because of it), they also re-started the globalization that WWII had brought to a halt.
This globalization process was interrupted during the late 1960s and early 1970s, owing to the Vietnam War, the suspension of the US dollar’s convertibility into gold, the 1973 oil price shock, and the great stagflation.
But the United States and the United Kingdom then underwent a kind of conservative revolution and a revival of neoliberal economic policies, including widespread deregulation, trade liberalization, and unprecedented capital-account openness.
While this redesigned globalization process helped to fuel growth and development, its effects were uneven, and the financial and economic changes it wrought outpaced legal and ethical adaptation.
Particularly consequential, innovative financial instruments were used with abandon, subject to only loose supervision and weak regulation.
As a result, finance eventually became the master of the world economy, rather than its servant.
Given all of this, when the crisis struck, it was deep and far-reaching, and today’s strengthening economic recovery has not overcome the understandable but devastating loss of trust in the financial system that followed.
This has been made apparent by political developments in the US and Europe.
US President Donald Trump’s administration continues to tout an “America First” policy approach, reflected, most recently, in the imposition of large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
The United Kingdom’s vote for Brexit reflects a similar backlash.
Meanwhile, state-led capitalism offers China’s economy its own protections.
But polarizing new models of competition and resistance to trade are not the way to restore trust.
Instead, we need to reassert control over the financial sector, to ensure that it is serving the economy, not vice versa, by advancing a set of goals upon which the world agrees – beginning with those established at three momentous conferences in 2015.
At the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, participants set economic, social, and environmental priorities with which financing flows and policies for sustainable development should be aligned.
At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York, UN member countries formally adopted an ambitious new global agenda.
And at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris, countries agreed to hold global warming well below 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Articulating these goals was an important first step.
But if the world is serious about achieving these shared goals, an effective mechanism for financing them must be established, supported by well-designed regulations that create the right incentives.
And, so far, the world has not made nearly enough progress on this front, as the continued misallocation of capital shows.
Stakeholders must take a longer-term view of business operations and investment strategies.
Finance must be made genuinely useful, balancing progress toward agreed goals – guided by existing global targets – with the need to generate sufficient financial returns to ensure that progress is sustainable.
We must keep saying it, and keep doing it.
There is no other option.
In some quarters, commitment to global goals has so far been too weak.
In the case of the US and the Paris climate agreement, that commitment has been rescinded outright.
But, to succeed, everyone must be on board.
This includes multilateral lenders, which need to revise old tools and rapidly develop new ones, in order to mobilize private-sector capital.
The private sector, for its part, must be open to an updated approach to public-private partnerships.
Simply paying lip service to change, while clinging to outdated modes of working, is not an option.
More broadly, we need to work to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared by all.
To that end, we should follow the advice of David Lipton, the IMF’s first deputy managing director, and move beyond the fashionable “OHIO” approach, focused on getting one’s “own house in order,” to the more demanding California – or “CA” – strategy of “collective action.”
The path ahead will not be easy.
But this is no excuse for apathy.
As investors, consumers, voters, and citizens, we must make our voices heard, in order to ensure that finance is used to promote shared values and the common good.
Only then can we go beyond merely avoiding another devastating crisis and build a better future.

In the Shadow of Tamarlane

Opening Europe’s Mediterranean Window
MADRID – One year after the fall of Hosni Mubarak, with popular upheavals continuing to roil the Arab world, it is increasingly clear that Europe can no longer sit still and do nothing.
The ongoing protests have exposed an urgent need for renewed engagement by the European Union with the region in general – and, in particular, with the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean that are the Union’s neighbors.
Until now, the European Neighborhood Policy, born as an afterthought of the EU’s successful policy towards Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, has governed the Union’s actions in the southern and eastern Mediterranean.
Over time, however, the ENP was largely hijacked by immigration and security considerations.
Moreover, it provided an economic lifeline to the region’s autocratic regimes.
On the Mediterranean’s southern shore, a panoply of grievances, from corruption to a desire for liberty, has motivated the unrest.
But the one underlying theme has been the absence of viable economic opportunities for the region’s growing population of unemployed, and underemployed, young people.
One year after the Arab Spring erupted, however, economic opportunities are even fewer.
The economies of Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia have all contracted sharply.
National budgets are strained, and foreign-exchange reserves are dwindling.
Instead of foreign investors jumping in, capital is flooding out.
Given the scale of the challenge facing Europe’s southern neighbors, the EU must forge a far more effective Euro-Mediterranean partnership than anything attempted thus far.
The first challenge is to reestablish trust, which requires Europeans to reconsider their attitude towards “political Islam,” in general, and Islamists in government, in particular.
A relevant litmus test is Morocco.
Even though it has not followed the region’s revolutionary path, Moroccans’ perceptions and aspirations mirror those in neighboring countries.
The EU welcomed the country’s recent constitutional reforms, as well as the election results that brought to power an affiliate of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood.
But the EU also called for a strong commitment to pluralism, the rule of law, and equal rights for minorities and women – key areas in which Islamists everywhere need to prove themselves.
This conditionality – the “more for more” principle – suggests that the EU has hit upon a viable way to influence developments in the region.
But there is also a need to dispel the idea that Europe, supposedly in decline, cannot be a useful interlocutor and partner in fostering regional prosperity.
On the contrary, the EU remains the Maghreb’s top trading partner, accounting in 2010 for 70% of the region’s exports.
Europe, though cash-strapped, can also facilitate engagement by multilateral institutions, from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where the EU is the biggest shareholder (close to 37%, compared to the United States’ 16% share), to the European Investment Bank, which recently raised the region���s loan ceiling by €1 billion ($1.3 billion).
Likewise, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recently announced the start of donor-funded activities in parts of the region, including Morocco, in 2012.
A good example of this sort of EU engagement is the €37 million Ouarzazate Solar Power Plant and Drinking Water Efficiency Program, sponsored by the EU Neighborhood Investment Facility, which was instrumental in securing loans amounting to more than €600 million.
It is this leveraging capacity that the EU needs to use more effectively.
Beyond challenges of perception, the success of renewed partnership with Europe requires the region to undertake vital structural reforms.
First, the region’s countries must consolidate a sound regulatory and institutional framework that will foster efficiency and legal security for investors, both local and foreign.
Such a framework is central to attracting not just big companies, but also to nurturing small and medium-size enterprises, which in Europe, for example, generated 85% of all new jobs in 2002-2010.
It is equally important to frame EU policy as a matter of co-localization, rather than de-localization, and to overcome the zero-sum mentality that is pervasive today.
An encouraging illustration of the co-localization approach is the launch of a Renault project in Morocco (which, unfortunately, prompted a public backlash at the height of pre-election fever in France).
Infrastructure is another vital concern, not only for linking the EU and the southern Mediterranean, but also for boosting the much-needed regional integration.
Today, most of the Maghreb’s economies are virtual enclaves, cut off from each other for reasons that are often political in nature.
Here, too, Morocco is a good example: the Western Sahara conflict looms large behind the closure of the border with Algeria, at an annual cost to both sides that is conservatively estimated at 1-2 percentage points of GDP.
More broadly, the Maghreb countries have the lowest intra-regional trade in the world, accounting for less than 5% of GDP, compared to 70% in the EU and 50% in North America, owing, in large measure, to a “spaghetti bowl” of preferential trade agreements and non-tariff measures within the region.
The EU should use its array of bilateral agreements with southern Mediterranean countries to promote a viable regional trade framework.
The Arab revolutions have given everyone the chance to look at the Mediterranean world with fresh eyes.
Instead of the old patron/client relationship, an EU/Maghreb partnership, as part of a transformed Neighborhood Policy founded on trust is needed. Only such a partnership can boost economic opportunity and increase prosperity – the demands that ignited the Arab upheaval.
If well managed, moreover, such a partnership could also contribute to buoying the European economies in their current time of trouble.

A Better Investment Framework for Africa
BERLIN – Africa’s enormous economic potential is not news.
But, until now, policymakers around the world have not successfully defined the political and economic steps that must be taken to enable Africa to realize this potential fully.
That is why the German G20 presidency has launched its G20 Africa Partnership initiative.
At the core of this effort to intensify cooperation with Africa lies the G20 Compact with Africa (CWA). The CWA offers interested African countries the opportunity to improve conditions for private investment, including in infrastructure.
The CWA’s structure is straightforward: African countries, together with their bilateral partners and international financial organizations with proven expertise on Africa (such as the African Development Bank, the World Bank Group, and the International Monetary Fund), will jointly develop, coordinate, and implement tailor-made measures.
The main aim is to lower the level of risk for private investments, by improving economic and financial conditions and strengthening institutions.
Over time, the resulting increase in investment will boost growth and productivity, create jobs, and raise living standards, as envisioned in the African Union’s own Agenda 2063 program.
The CWA stands for a new approach in international development policy.
Of course, we are not reinventing the wheel. But the mode of cooperation and coordination among the many bilateral and multilateral players, as well as the commitment of the African countries, is something new.
We view the CWA as a long-term, demand-driven process. It is open to all African countries that are interested in improving their investment environment on a sustainable basis.
But, most important, the decision-makers are the African countries themselves. They will determine what they want to do to improve conditions for private investment, with whom they want to cooperate, and in what form.
Only if the African countries “own” the initiative will it be a success.
So far, five African countries – Côte d’Ivoire, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tunisia – have committed to full participation in the CWA. Ghana and Ethiopia will join this month.
CWA countries, the international financial organizations, and bilateral partners are working closely together on the details of the country-specific compacts.
At the G20 meeting in Baden-Baden in March, some members – and also non-G20 countries – indicated that they would like to become bilateral partners.
The German government will also contribute via the bilateral framework – called a “Marshall Plan with Africa” – developed by our Federal Ministry for Economic Development and Cooperation.
Our main job, however, is to bring private investors and African countries together.
With the upcoming G20 Africa Partnership Conference in Berlin on June 12-13, we will provide a platform for these African countries to reach out to investors in order to enhance the continent’s engagement with the private sector.
CWA countries will present the key elements of their investment compacts in a roundtable with investors.
They will also outline the key industries and infrastructure projects for which they are seeking private funds.
After the Berlin meeting, the implementation phase of the CWA initiative will start.
The country teams will further specify their compact measures and consider the milestones for their implementation.
At this point, dialogue with investors will be particularly significant, because such conversations will help African countries to establish which measures and instruments are crucial for engagement with the private sector.
To be successful, this initiative cannot focus on short-term results.
It needs to continue beyond Germany’s G20 presidency in 2017/2018 and to be supported by the G20 over the longer term.
Germany, of course, will continue to take responsibility for the CWA’s implementation. The G20 will be informed on a regular basis about how the investment compacts develop.
Most important, by sending a signal to other African countries, progress in the participating countries will determine whether the CWA becomes a success for all of Africa.
If all parties involved – African countries, international organizations, bilateral partners, and, not least, investors – collaborate closely, the CWA has the capacity to promote sustainable, robust, and inclusive economic growth throughout the continent.

Europe’s Bad Trade Gamble?
PARIS – The start of negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the United States – officially called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – marks a key turning point for EU and world trade.
It also reinforces both sides’ shift away from multilateral trade policy in recent years.
That might be the right move for America, but it could spell serious trouble for Europe.
Over the past half-century, the EU, which represents only 7% of the global population, has managed to maintain an exceptionally strong trade position, despite the rise of emerging markets like China.
So, while the US and Japan have seen their respective shares of global exports fall, the EU’s share has remained stable, at around 20%.
Indeed, EU trade power contrasts sharply with the perception of a weakened Europe.
Most important, Europe was able to achieve it only by investing heavily in a multilateral trade system through the GATT and then the World Trade Organization.
And yet, while the EU owes much to the multilateral trade system, since 2006, it, too, has shifted to bilateralism, scoring its biggest successes with free-trade agreements with Latin America and South Korea.
An agreement with Canada is now within reach (though bilateral negotiations with India seem to have stalled, probably because the Indians do not believe that a free-trade agreement would help them much).
Officially, the EU considers a bilateral approach to trade to be perfectly compatible with a return to multilateralism.
But the facts belie this.
First, it is clear that bilateralism is growing as multilateralism wanes.
Since 2008, when the WTO’s Doha Round of global free-trade talks collapsed, the Europeans have proved unable to bring the US, China, and India back to the multilateral negotiating table.
More important, they evidently have given up trying.
This is reflected in the EU’s reluctance to press emerging countries to become parties to the WTO’s multilateral Agreement on Government Procurement, as if it has accepted that this issue can be resolved only bilaterally.
Moreover, since 2008, US trade policy has deliberately abandoned multilateralism in order to pursue containment of China via a two-pronged strategy: the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the TTIP.
The reason for this change is simple: The US no longer has the power to set the rules of the global trade system, but it considers itself strong enough to work around them.
The EU partly shares America’s strategic objective here, because it, too, has grievances against emerging powers in terms of market access, compliance with intellectual-property rights, access to government procurement, and subsidies to state companies.
But Europe must avoid alignment with this new and narrow US trade focus for several reasons.
First, Europe does not have an Asian strategy or TPP equivalent.
Granted, an agreement between the EU and Japan would be very beneficial to Europe and would diminish America’s advantages in Asia.
But if the US concludes the TPP before the Europeans secure an agreement with Japan, the Japanese government’s bargaining power vis-à-vis the EU would automatically increase.
In this sense, for both the US and Europe, agreement with Japan will be the key measure of bilateralism’s success or failure.
Second, and more fundamentally, the US is a political-military power in addition to being an economic power.
As a result, its partners’ trade calculus will always be shaped by strategic considerations, which are not a factor for them when dealing with Europe.
This is especially relevant with respect to China.
The US very clearly wants to check China by raising global trade standards.
But, if broader geopolitical considerations brought these two countries to an agreement, Europe could suffer.
Something akin to this happened during the climate-change conference in Copenhagen in 2009, where the US and China decided to oppose a comprehensive global agreement, effectively dismissing Europe.
Likewise, the US has no real interest in revitalizing multilateral trade negotiations, because bilateralism is much more effective in extracting concessions from emerging powers.
Europe has neither the same geopolitical interests as the US, nor, more important, the same means, which implies that it has a greater stake in revitalizing multilateral trade.
Indeed, the proliferation of bilateral agreements, with their own mechanisms for resolving differences, will inevitably weaken the WTO’s dispute-settlement mechanism, further undermining multilateralism.
The need to revive multilateralism is all the more important given that EU-US negotiations will likely be difficult and prolonged, owing especially to resistance from European and American regulators.
European regulators have already decided to tighten conditions for authorizing genetically modified organisms, as if to show US trade negotiators that they will not move easily from cherished positions.
Now that the TTIP talks have officially been launched, Europe must try to obtain the best terms that it can.
Above all, the EU must accept that global trade is a merciless political game, played according to a paramount rule: keep all of one’s options open at all times.

Can Palestine Win the Peace?
RAMALLAH – The rollout of the war-ending ceasefire agreement between Israel and Palestine last month was impressive.
With almost perfect synchronization, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced the end of the war on Gaza in a televised broadcast from his Ramallah headquarters, while Hamas leaders called on Palestinians in Gaza to take to the streets to celebrate their supposed victory.
Of course, with more than 2,200 Palestinians – mostly civilians – killed, over 10,000 injured, and thousands of homes, schools, mosques, and other structures destroyed, the war’s outcome can hardly be called a victory.
Nonetheless, this is the first time that Palestinians have been able to create something close to mutual deterrence with the Israelis.
Strengthening Palestine’s position further is the United Nations General Assembly’s recognition of Palestine as a non-member observer state, which Palestinian diplomats can use to exert political pressure on Israel to take their national aspirations seriously.
Palestine’s membership in UN agencies, not to mention the possibility of joining the International Criminal Court, has also boosted its leaders’ bargaining power.
All of these levers – not to mention the tremendous sympathy and support Palestinians have received from international observers – will be essential to ensure that the high price Palestinians paid during the 51-day war was not in vain. But the levers will be useless if the leaders of Hamas and Fatah, the two dominant Palestinian factions, fail to maintain a united front.
The effectiveness of such a cooperative approach was apparent in the Egypt-sponsored indirect talks with Israel.
The unified Palestinian delegation was convenient for Egypt and Israel, both of which consider Hamas a terrorist organization, and for Palestine, because it helped to bring an end to the violence. And it was a political boon for Abbas, who was able to field a delegation headed by one of his confidants, Azzam al-Ahmad, and thus claim the right to announce the ceasefire.
Having withstood the test of war, the Palestinian unity government that was created less than two months before the conflict began will now become the main vehicle for Gaza’s reconstruction. But Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah will face considerable challenges – beginning with Gaza, where his executive authority is severely limited.
More broadly, the unity government’s success depends on the ability of the Fatah-led Palestinian government and Hamas – and, to whatever extent possible, Islamic Jihad – to cement their cooperation by agreeing on a path toward liberation and freedom.
A clear, realistic strategy will be integral to Palestine’s efforts to win support from regional and international actors eager to end the decades-old conflict with Israel.
This will, of course, require compromises from all sides.
Hamas must reconsider its refusal to recognize Israel.
For its part, the Palestinian leadership must pursue active resistance alongside negotiations with Israel, while defending more vigorously Palestinians’ right of return, which it has often ignored in an effort to appease the Israelis.
But establishing a unified strategy is only the first step.
Ordinary Palestinians, who will undoubtedly have to make sacrifices, must be brought on board – especially given the heavy price they incurred during the recent conflict, in which they had no say.
With broad public support, Palestine’s unity government will be able to rally the international community behind its fair and reasonable demands for a truly independent state, free of sieges, separation barriers, and foreign settlements – demands that fall squarely within the realm of basic human rights.
Just as the international community isolated South Africa until it abandoned apartheid, it can put pressure on Israel through boycotts, divestment, and sanctions, while calling upon Israel’s allies to stop providing aid and arms.
If Palestine’s leaders truly want to end the cycle of violence in Gaza, they must begin by resolving their own internal disagreements and present themselves as a cohesive, reliable, and committed negotiating party.
They must band together behind the simple but powerful goal expressed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the General Assembly in New York: “We will build again, but this must be the last time to rebuild.”
For Palestine’s unity government, the time to begin the rebuilding process is now.
If Fatah and Hamas are willing to do what it takes to achieve peace, this may well be their best chance.

Trump’s Assault on Refugees
LONDON – The decision by US President Donald Trump’s administration to stop funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has politicized humanitarian aid, threatens to add yet more fuel to one of the world’s most combustible conflicts, and jeopardizes the futures of a half-million Palestinian children and young people.
Originally created to deliver basic assistance to refugees displaced during the creation of the Israeli state, the UNWRA has provided health care, employment, and emergency food and shelter for displaced Palestinians since 1949.
Today, nearly two million refugees receive emergency food and cash assistance from the organization, and each year millions use the 143 UNRWA-run health clinics.
But the majority of UNRWA’s budget goes towards educating children and young people, half of them in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, and the rest in Gaza and the West Bank.
UNRWA runs nearly 700 schools, serving more students than any other UN organization.
Some 75% of the population of the Gaza Strip receives some form of UNRWA assistance, and 60% of Gaza’s children from first to ninth grade attend UNRWA schools.
Without aid from the US, however, UNRWA’s ability to deliver its most valuable service will be severely diminished.
This directly contradicts the commitment made by world leaders, as part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to ensure that every child is in school by 2030.
Though UNRWA has more than 100 donors, almost a quarter of its total budget – nearly $400 million annually – previously came from the US.
In fact, for nearly 70 years the US has been UNRWA’s most generous and reliable donor, with both Republican and Democratic administrations recognizing the organization’s value.
Now, UNRWA’s other donors – the top ten of which contribute some 80% of the body’s total budget – are under pressure to bridge the funding gap. And some donors are already stepping up.
In Germany, UNRWA’s third-largest funder, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas recently announced that the government is “currently preparing to provide an additional amount of significant funds” to the organization.
Similarly, the United Kingdom has just added £7 million ($9 million), bringing its total contribution for the current year to £45.5 million.
Sweden recently committed $206 million of non-earmarked funding over the next four years.
The European Union, UNRWA’s second-largest donor, has provided an advance on this year’s funding, and pledged to maintain its contribution in 2019 and 2020.
Other donors – such as Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, and Switzerland – have agreed to frontload their funding as well.
This is good news, but we will need to do more to offset the coming loss of US support at a time when budgets are already strained by the fast-increasing humanitarian needs of the world’s other 60 million displaced people, including more than 20 million refugees (a post-World War II record).
Likewise, the Education Cannot Wait fund, established in 2016 to aid children and young people affected by wars and emergencies, now must consider 40 separate emergencies and protracted crises.
As yet, the organization, led by Yasmine Sherif, lacks the necessary funding to help close the huge financing gap.
Beyond reducing substantially the UNRWA’s capacity to deliver basic services to Palestinian refugees, the shortage of resources will also threaten the already tenuous stability of the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.
As Maas put it, “the loss of this organization could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction.”
Kids would be pushed from UNRWA classrooms onto the streets, where they would be more vulnerable to dangerous scenarios such as recruitment efforts by terrorists, who will surely jump at the chance to argue that if we can’t keep our aid promises, peaceful coexistence with the West is impossible.
Child marriage, child labor, and child trafficking would rise.
A generation of children and young people would be lost, in a region more unstable than ever.
The Trump administration has offered a number of imaginative but unconvincing justifications for its decision.
For example, it claims that other countries should have been paying more for a long time.
But, even if that were true, it would hardly justify the sudden elimination of all support.
The administration also asserts that UNRWA is inflating the number of Palestinian refugees, not all of whom deserve the “right to return” (a major sticking point in peace negotiations with Israel), and that the organization has outlived its usefulness.
But, again, the argument is not convincing.
To be sure, UNRWA has long been criticized by some for passing down refugee status across generations since 1948. The Trump administration is now considering a proposal to restrict the right of return from five million Palestinians to a few hundred thousand.
But, in response it is argued that the practice of defining refugees’ descendants as refugees is in accordance with international conventions governing refugee rights, as well as with international human rights and humanitarian law and the approach taken by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The fact is that, since UNRWA was created, the UN General Assembly, including the US, has not only renewed its mandate every three years, but also extolled its performance.
An overwhelming majority of UN member states, recognizing the unique role UNRWA plays in a volatile region, have consistently recognized the need to provide it with robust financial support.
As the world continues to seek an agreement for lasting peace in the Middle East, UNRWA (under the reforming leadership of Pierre Krähenbühl) is an important stabilizing influence and humanitarian force that advances the cause of peace.
Palestinian refugee children are already deeply disadvantaged.
If UNRWA is not given the support it needs, these children and their societies will pay an even heavier price.

Who Is Attacking Whom?
VIENNA – The year 2020 demonstrated, once again, that the relationship between the Western and the Arab and Muslim worlds remains muddled, complicated by lingering memories of colonization, wars, and atrocities that date back to the Crusades and, in modern times, to Algeria’s war for independence from France and the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
It is a relationship marred by suspicion, distrust, and resentment on the part of many (if not most) Muslims, as well as many in the West.
The thin knowledge that both sides of the relationship have of other cultures doesn’t lend itself to mutual understanding – a grim fact that radicals (again, on both sides) cynically exploit.
A plethora of recent initiatives have sought to promote intercultural dialogue and foster deeper understanding between civilizations and cultures, particularly Islam and the West.
Regrettably, these efforts, including the establishment in 2005 of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, have remained mostly confined to the well-educated, and their efforts have had no impact on ordinary people.
On the contrary, an extremist attack or utterance overwhelms such initiatives and reinforces the perception of two antithetical cultures locked in inevitable and immutable conflict.
The recent renewed uproar in France over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, and the shocking atrocities that followed there, clearly demonstrate the deep cultural divide that continues to roil relations between Islam and the West.
Why have these cartoons deepened this fissure anew?
Non-secular Muslims perceived these caricatures in a strictly religious framework, and the resulting anger and indignation spanned the entire Islamic world, from North Africa to Indonesia.
Many Muslims regarded the images as another deliberate and vicious Judeo-Christian attack on Islam, a continuation of the Crusades by other means.
Why, some ask, are attacks on Islam and its sacred symbols permitted, or even encouraged, while criticizing Israel or Holocaust denial is regarded as anti-Semitic and even punishable by law?
Likewise, why are the French flag and national anthem protected against desecration, while the most revered symbol of the Islamic faith is not?
Many in the West, on the other hand, regarded the beheadings in France, and previous and subsequent barbaric killings of innocent civilians in European cities, as outright assaults by “Islamist terrorists” against Western culture and the West’s way of life. These infamies, they say, were an attack on the West’s defining values and freedoms.
In the wake of these attacks, public awareness of the depth of the cartoons’ offensiveness has diminished.
With French President Emmanuel Macron at the forefront, Western leaders have argued for a strong and unwavering response to the recent murders in France.
Even though the overwhelming majority of Muslims have always denied that murderous extremists represent their faith, these tragic events became yet another opportunity for some on both sides to score political points and promote their own narrow agendas.
While some opined that Islam needs reform, others claimed that the solution is to restrict Muslim immigration to Europe – a course of action trumpeted most loudly, unsurprisingly, by US President Donald Trump’s administration.
And some Muslims, in response, want all Muslims to hark back to the Caliphate, a time when the Islamic world was united and powerful.
The truth is that the two cultures have profound philosophical differences regarding the meaning and scope of freedom of expression and belief.
Secular Western culture has an expansive view of these freedoms, regarding them as ultimate guarantees against oppression and authoritarianism.
The West thus gives precedence to freedom of expression over the sanctity of religious beliefs, regarding the latter as ideas that, like any other idea, should be open to criticism and even derision.
Islamic culture, by contrast, regards religious beliefs as sacrosanct and above the temporal fray, and considers mockery of any Abrahamic religious belief or symbol to be an attack against everything that Muslims hold sacred.
The difficult ongoing political and social transitions in much of the Islamic world mean that many Muslims feel the need to rely even more on the certainties of their faith as a counterweight to the rapid changes in the world.
They are not willing to tolerate an attack on the one constant in their lives that gives them solace, hope, and true meaning.
Given all the upheaval, confusion, and polarization in the world today, the last thing that either Islamic or Western civilization needs is new reasons for division and conflict.
What is badly needed, instead, is a wide-ranging dialogue between the two cultures that puts all contentious issues on the table, with the hope of gaining a sympathetic understanding of the other’s perspective and thus narrowing the gap that exists between both.
Whatever the ultimate outcome, the goal on both sides must be to agree on some formula of mutual respect and self-restraint that takes into account each culture’s particular sensitivities.
But for any dialogue to succeed, it must confront head-on the larger issue underlying the recent crisis: the distrust that exists between the two cultures.
The discussion should therefore take place at the grass roots and not be limited to the elite.
And it should frame intercultural engagement not as an inevitable clash of civilizations, but as an indispensable opportunity to seek mutual accommodation.
Only with this shift in perception and mindset will it be possible to build a genuine partnership of equals between Islam and the West.

The V-Shaped Recovery Marches On
LONDON – Large swaths of the global economy are exhibiting traditional signs of a V-shaped recovery from the pandemic-induced collapse this spring.
The monthly indicators for many countries show vigorous rebounds in June and July, with 10-15% projected growth in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in the third quarter, all else being equal.
To be sure, there are reasons to question whether the perceived upturn is merely a technical bounce-back – an illusion caused by the sheer depth of the initial collapse.
This could well be the case, especially if many countries suffer a strong second wave of COVID-19 infections, or if high hopes for an early vaccine turn out to be misplaced.
No one can know for sure.
We will have to wait and see the evidence as countries try to strike a balance between managing the virus and getting their economies back to normal.
Though the United States has struggled more than other countries with the virus, its rate of new infections nonetheless has fallen, making it more likely that its summer economic rebound will accelerate.
And in China, the latest indicators point to a high level of infection control and an accelerating recovery.
Given the dominant roles of the US and China in the global economy, such positive developments augur a major recovery for world trade, notwithstanding the two countries’ ongoing conflict over trade and technology.
As for Europe, many countries are showing signs of a second COVID-19 wave, with increased incidence posing a particular threat to Spain’s recovery.
But this is not the case everywhere.
Other countries have stepped up their control measures, and if these prove sufficient, they can keep their recoveries on track.
That is what we know now as of mid-September.
To be any more confident about the prospects for a sustained economic recovery in late 2020 and into 2021, we will need more evidence of progress toward improved treatments and safe, effective vaccines.
Whenever a vaccine is made widely available, a further acceleration in economic activity can be expected.
Those sectors that have suffered the most from social-distancing protocols – including international travel, entertainment, and hospitality – will start to come back to life.
In fact, unless all of the promising vaccine candidates that have already reached Stage Three trials fail, we can anticipate a recovery in these hard-hit sectors sometime in the coming months, at which point hope for a cyclical recovery will become even more justified.
But there are a number of structural issues to consider.
For starters, the most pressing question of this fall is whether the G20, currently chaired by Saudi Arabia, can resurrect itself and deliver genuine international cooperation, as it did after the 2008 global financial crisis.
According to the World Health Organization and other international health bodies, roughly $35 billion is needed to ensure that vaccines can be equitably distributed to the world’s 7.8 billion people.
This is a trivial sum compared to what many G20 countries have already spent to support their domestic economies.
Yet funding the universal distribution of a vaccine is absolutely crucial for ensuring a global recovery, rather than one that is limited just to those countries where a vaccine is available.
Equally pertinent, though less discussed, is the balance of forces between domestic and external growth.
Owing to the anxiety created by the pandemic, many governments, notably in the European Union, have demonstrated unprecedented levels of enthusiasm for fiscal stimulus, and these spending programs have been further supported by extraordinarily generous monetary policy.
Expansionary macroeconomic policies suggest that, barring a sudden and significant fiscal retrenchment, domestic demand will drive this recovery more strongly than it did in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.
This would likely translate into a recovery in world trade above what many commentators currently consider possible.
But that brings us to a third structural issue.
When will all the current spending be paid for, and by whom?
There already seems to be a reasonably strong consensus across advanced economies that early fiscal tightening should be avoided.
I, for one, would welcome a tightening after the crisis has passed.
But, of course, much will depend not just on the scale and speed of the recovery but also on the size of fiscal deficits.
Here, it is interesting to note that expectations for additional fiscal stimulus in the US have recently been downgraded as a result of better-than-expected employment data.
As for monetary policy, the US Federal Reserve’s announcement in late August that it will shift to an “average inflation targeting” regime has been greeted as an additional form of support.
But a caveat is in order.
Whether the policy change sticks will depend on how inflationary pressures are actually developing.
If financial markets were suddenly to become concerned about an unexpected increase in inflation, policymakers might have to shift their approach once again.
A remaining open question, one that I have raised in previous commentaries this year, is how policymakers will respond to the changes wrought by the COVID-19 crisis.
Will they nurture a new business culture geared toward “profit with a purpose,” encouraging (or cajoling) more corporations to pursue decarbonization and solutions to societal challenges like antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the threat of future pandemics?
That would certainly be a welcome development, and it is hardly a step too far for our governments.

Managing the Earth
Sometime in the next twenty years, the relationship between human beings and the natural world is going to change, profoundly and forever.
It won't happen suddenly, but current scientific developments will make change inevitable.
Like it or not, ready or not, these scientific developments are putting us on the road to becoming the managers of the global ecosystem, rather than just a participant in it.
I like to think about this coming revolution in historical terms.
For most of the three and a half million years that beings we might call "human" have walked the Earth, they were unambiguously part of the natural system.
The iron laws of evolution governed their survival, and those who couldn't compete died early and were soon forgotten.
Our only defenses against a hostile world were primitive stone tools and fire - a minimal kind of protection at best.
Then, about 10,000 years ago, something extraordinary happened.
Somewhere in the Taurus mountains in what is now Turkey, a group of people, probably women, began to develop a new set of technologies that would change the way that human beings interacted with their environment.
We call these technologies "agriculture," and, for the first time, they gave human beings the power to move outside the laws of natural selection.
No longer would our ancestors have to content themselves with the food that nature offered - they could start to grow their own, far surpassing nature's meager supply.
Since the birth of agriculture, human history has been a steady progression of further liberation from the restraints of nature.
Instead of generating power using human and animal muscles, we developed machines that could liberate sunlight stored in coal and oil.
Instead of relying on natural defenses against diseases, we developed antibiotics and the other tools of modern medicine.
The result is that human beings are no longer really a part of nature - the survival of our species no longer depends on our ability to compete in the Darwinian jungle.
We depend on our social structure and technology, rather than on our genes.
Today, we are poised to take another giant step, one that will bring us back into the natural system of our planet rather than remove us farther from it.
For the first time in history, we are starting to understand how the living things around us work, how all the pieces fit together.
Some of these advances are theoretical, allowing us to build computer models of complex systems like continent-wide forests or entire oceans.
Others are more mundane, involving long-term experiments and observation of smaller ecosystems, such as plots of prairie grass or swamplands.
Finally, of course, we have the spectacular advances in our knowledge of genomics, the science that lets us understand the basic mechanisms that operate inside all living systems, including humans.
Together these new areas of science will allow us to manage the ecosystems on our planet, predicting the effects of human interventions, anticipating the flow of natural cycles.
We truly have the power to become the managers of planet Earth.
This is not a responsibility we can shirk.
The analogy I like to use involves the homely example of caring for a suburban lawn.
You can decide to mow the grass, in which case you produce one kind of ecosystem, one kind of future.
Or you can decide not to mow the grass, in which case you produce another kind of ecosystem, another kind of future.
Either way, your actions determine what happens to the lawn.
The one thing you cannot do is fail to decide.
No matter what you do, even if you decide to do nothing, the future of the lawn depends on you.
In fact, our relation to the planet will be like that of a gardener to a garden.
The gardener doesn't destroy his plants indiscriminately, but he does regularly pull up weeds.
The gardener doesn't "conquer" his or her plants, but studies them to produce the garden that is desired.
Most importantly, the gardener does not manage the garden for the sake of the plants, but for some other goal - to raise food, produce flowers, or just to look pretty.
In the same way, human beings are on the brink of being able to manage the planet, and the decisions we make will determine what the future of the planet will be.
Given the phenomenal rate at which science advances these days, it is not too early to start thinking about how we are going to handle this awesome new responsibility.

Don't Bet on a Quick US Recovery
Whither the US economy?
Every piece of good news suggesting that America's recession is about to end is followed by bad news suggesting otherwise.
The Federal Reserve Board's current monetary policy reflects this ambiguity: it is neither lowering nor raising interest rates.
Instead, it maintains a "neutral" stance.
The meanderings of the stock market are a similar indication of uncertainty.
Much of the discussion of the US economy is of little help, for it is focused on the wrong question: when did the recession start and end?
Recessions typically are defined by whether GDP has fallen .
But what is of real concern is the gap between the economy's potential and its actual performance.
In these terms, the American economy's performance is likely to remain dismal.
Increases in measured productivity mean that the economy's potential growth rate is now somewhere between 3.5-4% annually.
(There have been changes in the way we correct for price changes, so that what we measure today as 4% actually represents what we used to measure as a substantially smaller number.)
Even when America grows at 0.5%, a gap of 3% in a $10 trillion economy means a loss of output of $300 billion--an enormous amount by any definition.
The shortfall, in turn, implies rising unemployment.
Given the huge gap, the US will have to grow in excess of its long run potential in order to get back to utilizing its resources fully.
Even with the surprisingly strong growth numbers for the first quarter of the year, most forecasters see growth over 2002 as a whole falling short of its long run potential, and by a significant amount, implying that unemployment will rise.
There is a simple interpretation of what has been happening to the US economy.
The recession of 2001 combined an inventory downturn with an investment downturn.
The first is now over; the second--the result of overinvestment in high technology and telecommunications, the sectors that were so important in the boom of the late 90s--may last considerably longer.
There remains a considerable capacity overhang--such as fiber optic lines that remain dark, having yet to see any light pass through them.
Merely lowering interest rates did not, and will not, lead firms to invest more in these sectors.
The good news--and the bad--is that the pace of technological change in these sectors is sufficiently fast that much of the equipment may become obsolete well before it is worn out, or even used, enabling new investment to start faster than it otherwise would.
Meanwhile, the US cannot expect much relief from exports, given the global economic slowdown, or from consumer spending.
Typically, a rebound in consumption helps to reinvigorate the economy; but consumption has, almost miraculously, sustained the economy as investment has fallen, and thus there is little scope for a rebound.
The risks are mainly on the downside.
There is a significant chance that with Americans' savings rate at dismally low levels - sustained last year by car purchases and home refinancing - consumer spending may moderate.
Some of the sales in 2001, moreover, reflected purchases that would have been postponed until this year were it not for special offers inducing consumers to buy cars earlier than they otherwise would.
Even Americans can consume only so many new cars.
On the contrary, a high level of indebtedness now afflicts US households.
This sharp deterioration in the US fiscal position means that long-term interest rates have fallen little, even as short-term interest rates reached record lows.
Rising unemployment adds to a sense of economic insecurity, and may further weaken consumption.
Record levels of military expenditures are the only major source of expansion, and while such expenditures may be necessary and do stimulate the economy in the short run, they do not enhance its long-term competitiveness and strength.
After initially believing that its economy was so strong that it would not only be unaffected by America's slowdown but also maintain robust growth, Europe has turned to looking to the US recovery to lift it out of its malaise.
I think this is a risky strategy; if a strong US recovery is not around the corner, then Europe needs to act on its own, using the standard counter-cyclical tools of monetary and fiscal policy.
The threat today is not inflation, but unemployment.
It is unemployment and economic insecurity that breed xenophobia and support for extreme rightist movements across the continent.
Unfortunately, Europe's hands are partially tied by a central bank that focuses on capping inflation, and a Stability Pact that, as customarily interpreted, limits the use of deficit spending as an economic stimulus.
The challenge going forward will be to reinterpret these strictures.
The prospect of sustained long-term growth and social justice requires that Europe's new institutions retain sufficient flexibility to reshape themselves as they confront new problems.

Ensuring Cybersecurity for Critical Civilian Infrastructure
STANFORD – The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that nurses, doctors, and other health-care workers not only play an essential role in keeping us safe and healthy, but also sometimes must risk their own lives and health to do so.
Throughout the crisis, they have rightly been applauded for their sacrifices.
But to ensure that they are fully supported in doing their jobs, we also must recognize the importance of the technologies that underpin the modern health-care system.
We don’t have to applaud software, but we do need to ensure that it is resilient against external threats.
Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting vulnerable communities, and health-care workers are no exception.
In addition to the challenges they face working overtime to help COVID-19 patients, they also must confront ruthless cyberattacks, just when they have the least bandwidth to defend themselves.
Using both large-scale ransomware campaigns and highly sophisticated targeting techniques, hackers are singling out hospitals, medical facilities, and vaccine laboratories.
Over the past two months, such attacks have occurred every three days.
We must do more to protect vulnerable communities wherever they are under attack, understand attackers’ motives and methods, and push for better legal protections and more responsible behavior online.
If criminals or hostile states were threatening health-care workers with physical weapons, the outcry would be immediate and deafening.
So why have we not seen a similar reaction to these cyberattacks?
Part of the problem is that we are still playing catch-up.
Earlier incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks in 2017 did not prompt the serious collective response that they should have.
In addition, the flood of disinformation – an “infodemic” – during the pandemic has compounded the threat.
According to the World Health Organization, during a pandemic, an infodemic can be just as dangerous as the virus itself.
But, beyond sector-specific threats, cyberspace also suffers from broader, longstanding problems of accountability.
There is a persistent lack of consistency in how international law is applied and enforced.
Many countries have a deep digital divide in technical capacity, and have failed to put human rights at the center of cybersecurity discussions.
It is time to patch these holes, so that we can replace scattershot responses with a systematic and collective approach.
The pandemic has underscored how much all of us – governments, businesses, and ordinary citizens – depend on cyberspace.
As a public good, cyberspace should be safe and reliable; and because it is a shared resource, we have a shared responsibility to protect it.
As digital citizens, we can all contribute to this broader effort.
Individual behavior – such as exercising greater caution when opening attachments or forwarding emails (which may contain disinformation or malicious code) – can make a significant difference.
At the same time, cybersecurity experts can have a major impact by pledging time and resources to help health-care professionals combat the latest wave of attacks.
Civil-society groups, academics, and the news media can raise awareness about the victims of attacks and the methods used. And businesses can do more to take responsibility as global players, including by ensuring that their supply chains are secure.
Governments are in a unique position to protect health care and other critical sectors from cyberattacks.
Through diplomatic, intelligence, and law-enforcement channels, governments have powerful and sophisticated tools to determine the sources and methods of attacks.
Perhaps most importantly, under existing laws and norms, governments have obligations not only to refrain from carrying out or supporting such attacks, but also to ensure that critical sectors are adequately prepared and protected.
Last month, the CyberPeace Institute joined others around the world in calling on governments to embrace these commitments fully.
Now more than ever, policymakers and state institutions must use their singular capabilities to protect vulnerable communities and sectors, and to hold those who perpetrate cyberattacks accountable.
Governments must invest the time, energy, money, diplomacy, and other resources needed to protect the infrastructure and systems upon which modern economic, political, and civilian life depends.
To aid in the effort, the CyberPeace Institute and other organizations have launched Cyber 4 Healthcare, a targeted service to connect health workers and organizations with qualified and reputable companies offering volunteer cybersecurity assistance.
But that is only the beginning.
In addition to protecting health workers, we need to find ways to assist other critical civilian infrastructure sectors.
That means extending support to vulnerable groups when they need it, holding governments and other stakeholders accountable to their commitments, and sharing information widely in order to inform law-enforcement agencies and policymakers.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest global crisis to highlight the need for a more stable and secure cyberspace for all.
It certainly won’t be the last.
Fortunately, when it comes to cyberattacks, we already have a cure.
It is time to start administering it.

The G7 Vaccine Charade
AUSTIN – In a recent essay on Samantha Power, President Joe Biden’s new administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Michelle Goldberg of The New York Times writes – correctly – that Power’s “first big test … lies in what America does to help vaccinate the rest of the world against COVID-19.”
And Power herself is quoted as saying that, “It’s about a very, very tangible, results-oriented agenda.”
Results seemed to follow.
At the G7 summit, Goldberg duly reports, Biden announced that the US would contribute 500 million vaccine doses for use in “low- and middle-income countries.”
According to Goldberg, this “spurred other countries to step up their contributions,” ensuring “a billion doses by 2022.”
Except that it didn’t.
According to the World Health Organization, the actual new commitment was for 870 million additional doses, not a billion, “with the aim to deliver at least half by the end of 2021.”
In other words, the “aim” would be to get “at least” 435 million additional vaccine doses to the COVAX facility (the international mechanism established to ensure vaccine access in poorer countries) “by 2022.”
Even if all billion come in over the course of 2022, Agnès Callamard, the Secretary-General of Amnesty International, has called it a “drop in the ocean,” made of “paltry half-measures and insufficient gestures.”
As Gavin Yamey of Duke University summed up the outcome for a Lancet working group, the “rich countries behaved worse than anyone’s worst nightmares.”
And there is a further problem: the G7 commitments are only promises, and the G7’s track record on meeting its promises is not especially good.
Here the language of the G7 communiqué is telling: “aim to deliver.”
Even if one believes that those words were chosen in good faith, they are not exactly precise or categorical.
Today, Africa and India have vaccinated barely 3% of their combined populations of about 2.5 billion people.
Why is that?
The US alone is reputed to have the capacity to produce 4.7 billion doses by the end of 2021 – four billion more than America needs.
Again, according to Amnesty International, the G7 will have “three billion doses surplus to requirement by the end [of 2021].”
Where are those doses going?
Apparently to wealthy customers.
This includes 1.8 billion doses committed to the EU for “booster shots,” as reported by Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla of Progressive International.
Meanwhile, outside the rich-country bubble, the virus can spread, mutate, sicken, and kill.
This is not merely a humanitarian issue.
If viruses are not eradicated, they evolve.
Already, multiple variants of the coronavirus have appeared.
As far as we know, none can overcome the available vaccines. But no one can say for sure that such a variant will not emerge, and the more time lost, the greater the risk – and not merely for the world’s poor.
One obvious solution is to get the hoarded stockpile into arms all around the world.
A second would be to waive patent protection and supply restrictions on the Western vaccines, so that they can be produced more rapidly in other countries.
If India alone – the world’s largest vaccine producer – could overcome current production difficulties, it could resume exports and start supplying doses to the rest of Asia and to Africa, while meeting its own requirements by the end of this year.
And enough doses could be produced to end the pandemic, for practical purposes, by the end of 2022.
In early May, the Biden administration announced its support for a proposal, advanced by India and South Africa, to waive Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) enforcement on COVID-19 supplies, including vaccines.
But what does this amount to?
So far, just support for negotiations.
With whom? Over what?
It was government, not the big drug companies, that underwrote the basic research used to invent these vaccines.
The companies have patents only because they were granted as an “incentive” to produce them.
The claim that otherwise they would not do so is absurd: the US government has the power of compulsion under the Defense Production Act, which it has already used to get vaccine production ramped up – including in a way that briefly disrupted Indian production.
Meanwhile, there’s China, and at a smaller scale, Russia.
China currently is vaccinating more than ten million people per day – an accelerating pace that will cover their entire population this year.
In 2022, China could produce up to five billion doses for the world – enough for India and Africa combined.
Meanwhile, Chinese producers are determined to build production sites worldwide, beginning recently in Egypt.
And Russia has plans to produce over 850 million doses of Sputnik V in India alone this year.
That’s just about the same as the entire G7 commitment – and it will happen sooner.
Not everything we read on these matters is necessarily reliable.
Not every projection will work out.
It may be true, as reported, that the Chinese vaccines are less effective than those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Sputnik V.
But for now, where this is heading is obvious.
The US and Europe are offering crumbs, protecting their billionaires, their pharmaceutical lobbies, and their politicians’ campaign contributions.
Meanwhile, China and Russia have other ideas – and the capacity to realize them.
So, before too long, when the back of this pandemic is finally broken, the world will have fresh evidence about who is reliable and who is not.
I would say that all of this is unprecedented, but it’s not.
In the cold and hungry European winter of 1947-48, Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, pleaded with the US for food shipments.
The US dithered, imposing conditions.
Klement Gottwald, head of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, appealed to Joseph Stalin, who put 300,000 tons of wheat onto trains.
Czechoslovakia fell under full communist control in February 1948.
Samantha Power is right.
It is all about tangible results.

Ivanka the Inevitable?
NEW YORK – In her autobiography, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, Donald Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, described an incident involving her father and his second wife, Marla Maples.
The family was supposed to take their private plane to Florida, but Maples was late.
Just as they were about to take off, a mere five minutes behind schedule, Ivanka saw a car pull onto the tarmac. Maples rushed out.
But when Ivanka pointed this out, her father refused to have the pilot stop.
His “frantic and frazzled” wife would just have to watch from the tarmac as their plane disappeared into the clouds.
One might think Trump’s behavior heartless and cruel. One might see an empty, ego-driven bid to assert control over those who fail to obey.
But, in Ivanka’s eyes, it was a necessary life lesson in punctuality.
Decades later, she seems to have internalized many of her father’s teachings in callousness, added a dutiful Stepford Wife veneer, and established herself as his most formidable – and dangerous – heir.
Five years ago, I would not have wasted a moment thinking about Ivanka Trump.
I would have happily left her celebrity life – first as a model, then as an executive of her ersatz fashion label – to the tabloids.
I would never have written about her father, either.
Yet this gold-plated family’s takeover of much of America’s political, psychic, and even spiritual life leaves little choice but to pay attention.
This is not only because the patriarch served a term as US president.
Just as Trump made all his adult children senior vice presidents at the Trump Organization, he turned his White House into another failing branch of the family business.
For Ivanka, that meant becoming a “senior adviser” to the president.
Four years later, and with no accomplishments to her name, she seems to be preparing for a political career of her own.
In a sense, Ivanka has little choice but to embrace politics.
She built her career on the family name.
Her modeling jobs depended on her father’s status and her mother Ivana’s modeling legacy.
And her fashion brand was simply other people’s designs, with her name on the label.
But, after Donald’s malignant presidency, the Trump name has become toxic in the fashion world.
Major retailers like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus dropped Ivanka’s product lines years ago.
And some former commercial partners have complained about her unethical practices.
So, instead, Ivanka will carry her father’s political brand forward.
But with New York giving the Trumps a “Bronx cheer,” Ivanka’s likely launch site will be Florida – a state her father won in 2016 and 2020, and the home of his glitzy Mar-a-Lago resort and country club.
Late last year, Donald changed his official domicile from Manhattan to Mar-a-Lago, which he seems intent on making his primary residence after he leaves the White House, though residents of Palm Beach are fighting hard to stop him.
For her part, Ivanka recently purchased a $30 million waterfront lot near Miami Beach.
This suggests that Ivanka may be considering a Senate run, especially if her father plans to run for re-election in 2024.
But, given that her father openly considered making her his vice president in 2016, there is also a chance that “The Donald” will operate from the sidelines, while Ivanka pursues the top spot on the 2024 Republican ticket.
For the Trumps, Ivanka may well be the ideal frontwoman.
She is as soulless and cutthroat as her father, but more polished and polite, and she seems to be at least partly aware of the flaws in the Trump brand.
For example, with her 2017 book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, she attempted to position herself at the nexus of ambition and relatability.
Of course, the vast majority of successful women did not ascend a golden, Trump-branded escalator. They took the stairs.
Not surprisingly, Ivanka’s self-aggrandizement comes across as exceedingly tone-deaf to many “women who work.”
At a G20 summit last year, then-International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde seemed shocked when the US president’s daughter interjected in a discussion among world leaders.
She also raised eyebrows in 2017, when she took her father’s seat among heads of state at a G20 Summit.
Of course, Trump didn’t invent nepotism, and political dynasties are a longstanding American tradition.
Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush benefited more from name recognition than actual achievements.
Liz Cheney would not be one of the most senior Republicans in the House of Representatives if her father wasn’t former Vice President Dick Cheney.
To this day, barely an election passes in which a Kennedy isn’t running for a House seat.
And how can I, with a name like Khrushchev, possibly rail against nepotism?
For starters, my name will not get me an office in the Kremlin; on the contrary, in Vladimir Putin’s Russia, I am mentioned in civics textbooks as an exemplar of how not to be Russian.
Even when my great-grandfather, Nikita, led the Soviet Union, blatant nepotism wasn’t an option.
In the 1950s, when he made his son-in-law, Alexei Adzhubei, part of his brain trust, tongues wagged.
In the secretive milieu of Soviet politics, family members rarely became public figures.
And when Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s first post-Soviet president made his daughter Tatiana his formal adviser with a Kremlin office, critics called it a blatantly corrupt move.
But even among beneficiaries of nepotism, the Trumps are a step beyond corruption.
For them, nepotism is just the start of the self-dealing.
That is why Ivanka’s budding political career should worry everyone.
Ivanka Trump is just as greedy and narcissistic as her father, and just as merciless as the man who left his wife on the tarmac.
If she does end up breaking the presidential “glass ceiling” in 2024 – possibly after defeating Liz Cheney in the Republican primary and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris (who owes her success to her own hard work) in the election – it will not be because she deserves it.
And she will use her power just as her father has: for the Trumps and no one else.

The End of the European Supernation?
MADRID – Since the eurozone crisis began in 2008, the European Union has, from a political perspective, led an intergovernmental life in supranational clothing. But as the EU prepares to negotiate Britain’s exit, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the Union no longer has any clothes at all.
The question now is whether the EU’s status as an enterprise dominated by its member states is permanent.
The supremacy of member states – especially Germany – in EU decision-making is far from new.
It was evident throughout the euro crisis, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, along with the European Council’s then-president, Belgium’s Herman Van Rompuy, took center stage.
But the myth of European supranationalism persisted. In particular, after Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission in 2014, the EU’s executive branch began to bill itself as a Brussels-based institution capable of leading the way toward what Juncker called in his 2015 State of the Union speech “more Union in our Union.”
This year, Juncker delivered a far more sober speech.
Indeed, it seems that the June Brexit vote has chastened not only Juncker, but all of the Commission’s Europhiles, who have largely been sidelined in the ensuing battle over what Europe will look like. (The notable exception is Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s very public stand on taxation, the outcome of which is still to be determined.)
Instead, that battle has been playing out largely within the European Council, with Merkel assuming a central role.
While it is impossible to say exactly what the EU that emerges will look like, it seems clear that it will look nothing like the Brussels-centric, deeply integrated Shangri-La long sought by many at the Commission.
Council President Donald Tusk has been especially adamant on this point, criticizing “naive Euro-enthusiastic visions” and calling for a more modest Europe that promises less and delivers more. Tusk reiterated this position just before the recent informal European Council summit in Bratislava – the first not to include the United Kingdom – declaring that “giving new powers to European institutions is not the desired recipe.”
Merkel, for her part, spent the summer preparing a member-state-led approach to the Brexit negotiations and Europe’s future. The discussion and outcome of the Bratislava summit underscored these efforts.
As for the Commission, its only real action in recent months was to appoint Michel Barnier in July as its chief representative in the Brexit negotiations.
With the Council taking command of that process, it is far from clear what Barnier will actually do.
In fact, with member states’ domestic politics playing a more important role than the European Council in driving whatever EU policy momentum exists, even an intergovernmental EU may be too much to hope for.
Consider Germany, where the dreadful performance of Merkel’s Christian Democrats in a string of regional elections, including in her home state of Mecklenberg-West Pomerania, has caused many to question the country’s trajectory. Now, the wait is on for next year’s federal election, which may send the country – and its approach to EU leadership – in a very different direction.
Uncertainty is also coming from other directions: Italy will hold a constitutional referendum by the end of this year, and France and the Netherlands will hold elections next year.
None of this is to say that supranationalism is a thing of the past.
But it is likely that parochial interests will become even more dominant, at least until major elections are complete.
An opening for a European approach may follow, but only if the current torpor does not lead to institutional atrophy.
Earning the public’s trust is crucial.
In the past, the EU has forged ahead, as if the public approved. It does not.
As Hubert Vedrine, a former French foreign minister, recently estimated that only 15-20% of Europeans are Europhiles, another 15-20% oppose the EU outright, and the remaining 60% are “euro-allergic.”
It is a rough but fair portrait.
Put simply, for much of the public, EU institutions lack legitimacy. The reasons are well known: poor communication, a democratic deficit, finger pointing between member states and the Commission, a flawed institutional architecture.
Juncker and Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, can speak about méthode communautaire until they are blue in the face; it is not happening in the foreseeable future.
The result is clear: in the struggle over how Europe will develop, the EU institutions lack the authority or support to put up much of a fight – or even fully enter the ring.
But this moment of national navel-gazing among the member states may actually present an important opportunity for EU institutions to work on closing the legitimacy gap.
This means resisting the urge to wax poetic about future actions that never actually materialize, or to roll out impressive-looking programs with few real-world effects.
It means, instead, completing key initiatives, most urgently the banking union; improving accountability; and ensuring that the public understands what the EU institutions are doing.
And it means staying out of political conflicts, which neither the European Commission nor the European Parliament are in any position to win.
If this approach seems cautious, that is because it is.
Now is the time not for risky shortcuts, but for meticulous, well-planned, incremental measures that gradually and consistently earn the public’s trust.
The relatively modest list of concrete priorities issued by Juncker and Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans is a good start.
Most people are not stupid.
They can generally tell when they are being strung along, and they are tired of empty rhetoric and half-baked initiatives.
Only if the EU institutions deliver genuine action, in a credible and transparent manner, can they ensure that the current inter-governmentalism is just a phase and that the future of Europe is Europe.

From Solidarity to Freedom
Although the rise 25 years ago of Solidarity, the first independent civic movement in the former Soviet empire, had huge political consequences, Solidarity was, primarily, neither a political movement nor a labor union.
First and foremost, Solidarity was a cry of dignity.
We simply had reached the end of our endurance with the omnipresent and all-powerful communist apparatchiks who ruled in our workplaces, neighborhoods, even places of rest.
Writers, journalists, and artists could no longer stand the heavy-handed censorship and supervision.
In factories as well, Party bureaucrats wanted to know everything and decide everything.
Every civic initiative, every activity of any kind was subject to ideological evaluation and control.
All who were tempted to disobey were certain to be “taken care of” by the secret police.
Last winter, I saw a similar cry for dignity in Ukraine.
Those hundreds of thousands of people who camped for weeks on the freezing streets of Kiev did so because they were demanding their dignity.
Both the Polish and the Ukrainian experiences have convinced me that the will to live in dignity is the most powerful engine of human action, an engine that is capable of overcoming even the greatest fear.
But the desire for dignity is not enough to secure it.
Something else is needed as well.
Second, Solidarity was a social movement. This meant that Solidarity – ostensibly a labor union – became a home for people from all social groups and classes in Poland: workers and intellectuals, engineers and artists, doctors and patients.
Some passionately discussed economic reform, others talked about developing culture, while still others planned to reform education and the scientific establishment or assure the defense of the environment.
Solidarity created a public space for all of these discussions, while protecting us all against the party apparatus.
But Solidarity was still something more.
It was a Polish version of the ancient Greek agora, a meeting place of all citizens, a locus of a free conversation about our communal and individual future, about all kinds of problems and their solutions.
We did not yet have a free state, but we already had something more important than that: a free civil society engaged in discussing the common condition of its members.
The society embraced by Solidarity counted 10 million members; indeed, 10 million real citizens. But even that was not enough to achieve the final victory over the party and police apparatus of the state.
Third, Solidarity was an institution; indeed, a unique one given the conditions under which we lived, and it is to its special institutional form that we owe our ultimate victory.
Between the organizational structure of Solidarity and the official state and party organizations there was what might be called a “gap between civilizations.”
Against the authoritarian and hierarchical structures of the regime, we raised a decentralized institution, a huge organism striving to achieve consensus about its aims and the methods of action.
It was an institution committed to respecting the integrity of all individuals and all other institutions.
This may not be extraordinary in old democratic communities; but in our authoritarian environment, it was strikingly new. And only such a new institutional structure could respond to that deep cry for dignity.
So what is left of all this today?
To be sure, Solidarity achieved a stunning political success.
Poland is a free country, a member of NATO and of the EU, while the Soviet Union is no more.
But recent history has not been kind to the victors.
The leaders of the democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe quickly faded in the new environment.
Democratic elections brought out new and savvier politicians, often from among those who were part of the old regime.
More strikingly, some of our hopes for a new social order also crashed against the rocks of the new rules of the game.
True, Poland’s democratic institutions, despite their flaws, function rather well.
Economic growth has been impressive, and life is definitely getting better.
But the vibrancy of civil society, the sense of common purpose, the universal manifestations of social solidarity that our union stood for in its time – all these things are largely gone.
The union itself is a shell of its own former self, a partisan and mostly right-wing movement of workers buffeted by the new economic reality.
Most notably, the unifying character of Solidarity gave way to social divisions and, among many of Poland’s people, a large dose of alienation from both politics and civic engagements.
Is this what normalcy always means?
Do heady times of struggle always give way to a somewhat deflating taste of victory?
Am I merely a veteran wistfully reminiscing about the old days of struggle?
Perhaps. But I am not a nostalgic type.
I know that we have come a long way, and I do not want to go back. But was it really inevitable that so much solidarity had to escape our Solidarity?

The Syria Lessons
PRINCETON – As the United States and Russia try to broker a conference that can bring the various sides in the Syrian conflict to the negotiating table, potential Western participants, at least, should be thinking about the larger implications of the Syrian conflict for dictators and democracies around the world.
Here are the lessons thus far:
Bad guys help their friends.
The Russians and Iranians are willing to do whatever it takes to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power.
Hezbollah, supplied by Iran, has now moved openly onto the battlefield in support of the Assad regime.
Russia and Iran have kept the Syrian government supplied with heavy weapons and other military assistance, including a Russian shipment of sophisticated anti-ship missiles with advanced radar systems.
These will help Assad hunker down and fend off all comers in an Alawite mini-state that will include the Russian-leased port facility at Tartus.
Diplomacy without a credible threat of force is empty talk.
“Speak softly and carry a big stick,” Theodore Roosevelt counseled.
President Barack Obama rightly wants to lead in global affairs through civilian more than military power; he understands that military solutions to foreign-policy problems are hugely expensive and often counter-productive in terms of advancing US security and prosperity over the long term.
But Obama’s strategy in Syria seems to be “speak loudly and throw away your stick.”
Obama has made it clear over and over (as has NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen) that he has no interest in intervening militarily in Syria.
And the US response to the latest Russian missile shipment?
Secretary of State John Kerry said: “I think we’ve made it crystal clear we would prefer that Russia was not supplying assistance.”
The US has cast aside one of its most important foreign policy tools, creating an incentive for the Syrian government and its supporters to keep fighting until they are in the most advantageous position possible to negotiate a settlement – that is, if they have any incentive to negotiate at all.
If you are a dictator facing sustained political protests, be as brutal as possible and incite sectarian killing.
Part of Syria’s agony is the self-fulfilling nature of the conflict.
From March to December 2011, hundreds of thousands of Syrians marched every Friday, seeking the same political liberalization that Tunisians, Egyptians, Yemenis, Bahrainis, Jordanians, and others across the Middle East and North Africa sought in what was optimistically called “the Arab Spring.”
Unarmed, they were shot in the streets by riot police and government snipers, until they finally started forming small local militias for self-protection – militias that gradually grew into the loose federation of forces now known as the Free Syrian Army.
All the while, Assad was describing the violence as the product of terrorists and Sunni extremists seeking dominion over minority Alawites, Druze, Kurds, Christians, and other groups.
He worked assiduously to fan the flames of sectarian civil war, succeeding to the extent that now the chief reason for not intervening to stop the killing is the impossibility of doing so effectively in an environment of sectarian violence.
Regional organizations are still unable to solve regional problems without great-power leadership.
Turkey has been threatening and calling for military action for 18 months, but US officials say that the Turks are not in fact ready to do anything beyond providing support for refugees and opposition fighters.
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also sending arms to Syrian opposition groups, but the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council are paralyzed.
Without a great power that is willing both to share the lead and to push from behind, regional organizations cannot take charge in their own neighborhood.
Human suffering, even on a massive and destabilizing scale, will not move the world to action.
In a recent conversation about Syria with a couple of well-known foreign policy experts, one participant suggested that the Middle East’s current borders, drawn in colonial times, cannot last and must be redrawn.
I pointed out the possibility of a Middle East conflagration equivalent to the Thirty Years War in Europe, which is estimated to have killed between half and three-quarters of the population of some of the participating states.
One of my interlocutors agreed, but said that we could do nothing to stop it, because “that’s the period of history we’re in.”
For all the world’s pious proclamations about “never again,” a mantra arising from the Holocaust, mass murder almost never motivates foreign intervention.
It is astounding to think that the world mobilized immediately to push Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991, but has dithered for more than two years as tens of thousands of Syrians have been killed, and their country, a cradle of civilization, laid waste.
“Humanitarian” intervention – action that is motivated by our concern for the fate of fellow human beings – is often described as reflecting “moral concern.”
But how many wars does it take for us to understand that killing always begets more killing?
People who watch the butchering of their children and parents, the rape of their wives, daughters, and sisters, and the wanton destruction of their homes and livelihoods do not forget.
They carry vengeance in their hearts from generation to generation, until a measure of justice is done, nursing their enmity in frozen conflicts that block economic growth, prevent the formation of social capital, and paralyze political institutions.
When no side in a war has a reason to stop fighting, a peace conference cannot succeed.
In Syria, the moral, strategic, and political arguments all converge in favor of decisive action to stop the killing, if not forever, at least for now, to create a space for peace.
But if the lessons of the past two years are any guide, the wheels of violence will keep on turning.

The International Order After COVID-19
WASHINGTON, DC – Running parallel to the global battle against the coronavirus pandemic is a tug of war between two competing narratives about how the world ought to be governed.
Although addressing the pandemic is more urgent, which narrative prevails will have equally far-reaching consequences.
The first narrative is straightforward: a global health crisis has further demonstrated the need for multilateralism and exposed the fallacy of go-it-alone nationalism or isolationism.
The second narrative offers the counterview: globalization and open borders create vulnerabilities to viruses and other threats, and the current struggle for control of supply lines and life-saving equipment requires that each country first take care of its own.
Those in the first camp regard the pandemic as proof that countries must come together to defeat common threats; those in the second see it as proof that countries are safer standing apart.
At first blush, COVID-19 seems likely to corroborate the argument for a more coordinated international approach.
Given that the coronavirus does not stop at national borders, it stands to reason that the response should not be constrained by them either.
This makes perfect sense from a public-health perspective.
If COVID-19 persists anywhere, it will remain an incipient threat everywhere, regardless of efforts to wall it off.
The more widely that testing kits and, when discovered, treatments and vaccines, are distributed, the faster the pandemic will be vanquished.
The more that scientific knowledge is shared, the faster those drugs will be developed.
And, in the meantime, the more that governments coordinate on matters such as travel restrictions and social distancing, the smoother the exit from this crisis.
The pandemic also would seem to call for greater collective efforts to resolve deadly conflicts, and not only as a means of helping vulnerable local populations.
Owing to the additional socioeconomic stress introduced by the pandemic, ongoing intra- or inter-state conflicts could lead to a further loss of governmental authority or even state collapse in countries already near the breaking point.
Beyond the obvious human costs, this would create new and growing pockets where COVID-19 could spread unchecked; larger migration flows over less regulated borders; and greater opportunities for violent non-state actors to exploit the chaos, take root, and expand.
Finally, there is a clear economic rationale for pursuing international cooperation.
By helping the hardest-hit countries, all countries can soften the blow they will experience from the looming global meltdown.
Yet the pandemic also strengthens the pull of the rival view.
Crises tend to intensify and accelerate preexisting trends – and severe crises all the more so.
The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with a period of mounting populist and nativist resistance to globalism and the post-war international order, fueled by inequities both within and between countries.
The global economic system that emerged following the end of the Cold War has benefited the few at the expense of the many, its detractors say, not without reason.
Similarly, the United Nations has come to seem like a relic, favoring victors of a long-ago war, reflecting obsolete power relations, and denying a sufficient voice to countries of the global south, many of which had yet to achieve independence by the time the UN was founded in 1945.
In parallel, and especially since the 2008 global financial crisis, socio-economic discontent has given rise to various forms of populism, nativism, and authoritarianism in countries ranging from Russia, Turkey, and Hungary to Brazil, Israel, and the United States.
These dynamics could well be strengthened by the COVID-19 crisis.
One vision of the future looks like this: In the coming months and years, dire domestic needs will make international solidarity seem like an unaffordable luxury.
As national economies contract, resources will shrink, and governments will struggle to provide for their own populations.
Political leaders will find it exceedingly difficult to justify allocating funds to foreign development assistance, international health and relief organizations, refugees, or diplomatic initiatives.
Mounting discontent at home will translate into even greater anger and disillusionment toward the international system.
Moreover, any remaining US claim to global leadership will have been battered, owing to the Trump administration’s mishandling of the pandemic, the sense that it was unable to care for its own, let alone others, and the perception that it withdrew into itself when the chips were down.
China, buoyed by its camera-friendly demonstrations of generosity at the height of the crisis, might step up to fill the leadership vacuum. But it also could find itself weighed down by its own botched handling of the outbreak, and by the domestic political implications of a profound economic contraction.
Regardless of who (if anybody) emerges on top, it is hard to believe that the socioeconomic despair caused by the pandemic will not prepare the ground for an even stronger nativist and xenophobic surge.
In many countries, the scapegoating of foreigners and minorities has already begun.
Might a superior, stronger international order emerge at some point?
Perhaps.
Even before achieving victory in World War II, the Allied powers began to devise a post-war order designed to prevent the reoccurrence of another global conflagration.
That order had profound weaknesses. Although it created the illusion of global governance, it could never be more effective than whatever the rival powers at its core would allow.
For all its successes, one can also list monumental failures.
And yet, the system that arose from the 1940s was clearly preferable to what preceded it.
In 2020, one can only begin to imagine what it would take to create a new, more sustainable order that addresses growing concerns about equality and in which more countries can find a voice.
In the meantime, we may have to navigate a new world in which a free-for-all abruptly replaces existing arrangements.
Even if the chaos proves temporary, it would be a sad, disruptive, and dangerous coda to the post-war era.
COVID-19 has laid bare the costs of confronting a global crisis with a flawed international system. The only worse outcome would be to confront the next crisis with no system at all.

Another Balkan High Noon
With the world focused on Iraq, North Korea, and a possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen.
That inattention will end soon; a decision about the province’s fate is looming.
The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before the end of the year on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
This decision – crucial to the future of an unstable region – will test Western determination and unity.
Negotiations this year in Vienna, brokered by the United Nations, showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on “final status” will not happen.
Talks continue, but, as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council, they are effectively dead.
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo’s independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
Indeed, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, has been trying in every way to undermine Kosovo’s interim government.
He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public education.
The main purpose of his new constitution is its preamble, which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part of Serbia.
Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians have proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia, no matter how tenuous.
Throughout the 1990’s, they virtually opted out of Serbian-run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions.
Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO’s subsequent intervention, which ended Serbia’s rule and established a quasi-state under UN administration, has made anything other than independence intolerable.
Some time over the next month or two, the Balkan Contact Group — the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia – will consider Ahtisaari’s recommendations on Kosovo’s final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision.
In public, all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo’s final status open, but informally the US and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year.
Some members of the Security Council – particularly Russia and China – are opposed to or skeptical of an imposed settlement, and few governments favor dividing up another country’s territory, however compelling the circumstances.
Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic effort.
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important.
An independent Kosovo must be secured and its minorities protected.
Northern Kosovo, now largely under Belgrade’s control, must not be partitioned off in all but name.
In the interest of reducing the blow to Serbia, the Security Council must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function.
If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status, it will produce a GRAVE situation: Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally, and all nations would have to make up their mind whether or not to recognize the new state.
If that happens, it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare their own independence.
At a minimum, Serbia would campaign strongly against recognition.
In fact, Serbia’s government is already trying to persuade the West to postpone a decision until mid-2007.
It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence, the ultranationalist Radical Party will come to power in the next elections, and believes that holding elections as early as this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council.
Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia’s Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
And they continue to push -- unsuccessfully -- for Ahtisaari’s removal in order to prolong the Vienna talks.
The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of this delaying strategy.
Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence.
That tactic may be working.
Many European Union countries are worried about the implications of taking away a country’s territory, as well as the impact of Kosovo’s independence on Serbian democracy.
Given Serbia’s political instability, they question the harm of a short-term postponement – albeit mostly self-inflicted.
But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision more difficult.
The West must ignore Belgrade’s siren song.
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable future, and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.
Likewise, there will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances.
But failure to proceed definitively now on Kosovo’s final status will produce a worse Balkan situation, one that blocks Serbia’s move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU, condemns Kosovo’s ethnic minorities to dangerous ambiguity, and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia.
No realistic solution exists for Kosovo but independence.
If Serbia wants to join the West, it must not forsake that opportunity by trapping itself in its nationalist past.

Peace, Not a Peace Offensive
TOKYO – When a North Korean dove clutching an olive branch suddenly appears, the world should challenge it to reveal its hidden talons.
This is the only prudent stance for South Korea to adopt when face-to-face negotiations with the North begin on February 8. For what Kim is now offering is not peace, but a “peace offensive” – a tactic used by the North repeatedly since the armistice of 1953 in order to sow division whenever the regime’s adversaries have demonstrated unity and resolve.
Kim’s less-than-innocent intentions are demonstrated by his regime’s secret construction of a massive uranium-enrichment facility, containing more than 2,000 centrifuges, revealed to Stanford University’s Siegfried Hecker, a former director of America’s Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The existence of the facility seems as clear a declaration as possible that the regime is committed to achieving the capacity to intimidate its neighbors with its nuclear arsenal.
Some believe that North Korea has begun displaying its growing nuclear threat in order to secure the succession to power of Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il’s rotund, twenty-something youngest son. But, given how long this facility must have been under construction, this cannot possibly be the sole, or even the main, motivation.
The “Dear Leader’s” key objective is most likely to secure his own position, given the North’s dire economic condition. For it now seems that the only way for Kim Jong-il to defend his family dynasty against any domestic challenge is to make a show of force as a nuclear power.
The challenges facing Kim are piling up.
Deification of the leader, once the foundation of the regime, is disintegrating.
Economic failure, chronic food shortages, mounting public distrust of and animosity toward Kim’s government, and an apparent reluctance within elements of the North Korean military to go to war all point to the regime’s increasing fragility.
There are also signs of growing adoration of liberal countries such as the US and South Korea throughout North Korean society – a sentiment that the regime has sought to appease by broadcasting one or two Western films on state television.
More ominously, crime is on the rise and a breakdown in state-controlled health care is fueling the spread of various types of infectious disease.
Kim’s hope must be that, by showing off his nuclear arsenal, he can bully the US, Japan, and South Korea into helping him to resolve some of his regime’s domestic crises.
Most immediately, Kim’s aim is to pressure Barack Obama’s administration into weakening the US-led sanctions against North Korea, having evidently decided that his dynasty has no future so long as the sanctions remain in place.
To drive the point home, his regime has been refusing to attend multilateral talks.
Here Kim has shown just how fundamentally flawed his understanding of the workings of Western democracy is.
He apparently believed that, following the defeat that Obama absorbed in the mid-term elections, the US would lack the will to stand up to a fresh nuclear threat and would move to conclude a peace accord with his regime, thus perpetuating his dynasty.
“We are ready for both dialogue and war,” Kim has declared.
But, of course, just the opposite is true: the victory of conservative Republicans in Congress has left Obama with even less room to offer carrots to the North.
Moreover, nuclear brinkmanship is a particularly poor tactic, since Kim’s behavior is now becoming fused in American minds with arguably the most serious strategic threat on the US agenda: Iran’s push to secure nuclear weapons of its own.
Indeed, there is considerable talk among Western security services that the recently disclosed centrifuges were not actually assembled in the Nyeongbyeon facility, implying that Kim’s regime is hiding another facility.
The question then becomes, who helped Kim build these facilities? Who transferred the technology that the North needed?
Although there is mounting circumstantial evidence of cooperative exchanges between North Korea and Iran, no conclusive proof has been found.
It has been reported that more than 200 North Koreans are currently working surreptitiously in Iran.
If these include personnel from Room 99, Kim’s secret nuclear directorate, and Room 39, the bureau that controls his slush fund of hard currencies, more attention is needed.
Of course, the inner workings of Kim’s regime are shrouded in mystery, not only to the outside world, but also to most of North Korea’s government.
The only way to increase transparency from outside is to shine a light on North Korea’s external activities, which means exposing as many connections and links between North Korea and Iran as can be found.
Nuclear cooperation between North Korea and Iran is no doubt assisting both countries to flaunt international norms – and now it appears that Burma has joined this axis of illicit nuclear proliferation.
One country could help the world gain the transparency – and the leverage – that it needs: China, over whose territory Iran and North Korea must be conducting their nuclear relations.
Assuming that China does not approve of this unholy alliance, it has a responsibility to call a halt to these exchanges.
Vague expressions of concern, such as those offered by President Hu Jintao during his Washington summit, will not do the job.

The Curing Machine
VIRGINIA BEACH – Last year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for a discovery that took 44 years to develop, and involved two different research teams.
The breakthrough promises new kinds of diagnosis and therapy, but what if such insights could be developed by computers in minutes, rather than decades?
The recent appearance of a new coronavirus, which has killed nine people in the United Kingdom and the Middle East, is a reminder that novel treatments are sometimes needed in a hurry.
With different modeling abstractions, it might be possible to build an artificial-intelligence system (AI) that could design new treatments.
That system would suggest surprising, effective therapies, because it would understand disease in ways that are difficult for humans to imagine.
The notion seems like science fiction: everyone knows that AI is not particularly clever.
In order to build a “curing machine” of this kind, at least one far-reaching innovation is needed: a better way of modeling entire systems, which would deliver new conceptual tools to both biology and computer science.
In both fields, the conventional approach has been reductionist, with problems modeled at the level of their most basic components.
While this makes it possible to build “expert systems” that reason in narrow domains, or to design search engines that can find discrete facts, we are no closer to AI that reasons the way that we do – in and across multiple contexts, including time.
AI cannot integrate information about seemingly distinct processes, such as chemical, physiological, and psychological events, or anticipate novel outcomes. We do these things over dinner.
Novelty is key. To build a curing machine, we would need a way for computers to assemble concepts so that unexpected arrangements could emerge.
In biology, there has been a similar reductionist approach, best exemplified by the Human Genome Project, which catalogued the molecular “recipe” for every aspect of the body, in order to discover how the most basic pieces interacted.
Alas, the expected revolution in therapies is yet to occur.
Worldwide, total annual investment in biomedical research is about $110 billion. HIV alone attracts many billions per year.
Yet, despite 25 years of intense investment in structural biology, we remain unable to move from understanding molecules to an understanding of whole systems.
A model of the dynamics between multiple processes – chemical, physiological, and psychological – would lend new insight into how diseases operate.
Consider, for example, the sense of smell.
The nasal cavity is unique, as the only place where brain cells (neurons) are directly exposed to the environment.
If we model smell on local terms, we can trace how nasal neurons interact with scent particles, sending signals through a network of other neurons to the brain.
We have good abstractions in structural biology to describe this.
But these neurons are also part of an adaptive, regenerative system.
Sensory neurons die a programmed death; you literally have a new sense of smell every month.
Modeling it requires the consideration of more than just local signaling.
Neurons operate as a cooperative group: more arrive at the location than are needed for a simple replacement. In order to facilitate the replacement, the extras become part of a dialog with surrounding cells, and others deep in the brain, then sacrifice themselves.
To explain why they voluntarily die, we would need a new system-level vocabulary.
It does not stop there.
When your neurons are replaced, they change.
If you are newly in love (or experience a trauma) and a scent is associated with it, you may develop a heightened sensitivity to that scent.
Your physio-cognitive apparatus evolves.
This process interests researchers enormously, because it is one of only two contexts in which neural regeneration occurs.
If it were understood, it could lead to cures for many crippling diseases, both neurological (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) and degenerative (including those, like cancer, associated with aging).
One way to understand how this higher-level coherence emerges is to study it in a more accessible form.
As it happens, there is a naturally occurring information structure in which the needed behaviors are easier to observe and explain.
That structure can be found in stories.
Stories are remarkable for the way that they allow us to comprehend new concepts, and continue to make sense of them, even when they involve numerous contexts and unexpected associations.
We take the resulting narrative effects for granted: surprise endings, intriguing situations, and a compulsion to read or watch until the finish.
If models of biology and AI included these dynamics, they would demonstrate how unexpected elements can emerge from an evolving coherence.
Indeed, incorporating this principle into both fields could result in new diagnostic capabilities and new forms of individualized treatment, with a different therapy designed for each person.
An infection such as the coronavirus is currently countered with a vaccine tailored to block it.
But what if there was a way to “tune” bodies to reject all infections?
For example, there are a few cases of natural immunity to HIV, but we are unable to understand why.
The challenge in biomedical and computational research is to model the dynamics between diverse processes at the level of whole systems.
Once we can do this, we are much more likely to develop AI tools that are capable of unexpected breakthroughs in understanding how the body supports and resists illness.

The Transparency Conspiracy
SOFIA – One of the most troubling outcomes of the ongoing financial crisis has been a collapse of trust in democratic institutions and politicians.
Indeed, in 2012, the global public-relations firm Edelman’s “Trust Barometer” survey registered the biggest-ever decline when it comes to government.
Can greater “transparency” – the new political mantra of civic activists and an increasing number of democratic governments – reverse this trend?
The hope is that a combination of new technologies, publicly accessible data, and renewed civic engagement can help people control their representatives more effectively.
But the idea that transparency will restore public trust in democracy rests on several problematic assumptions, primarily the belief that “if only people knew,” everything would be different.
Unfortunately, matters are not so simple.
The end of government secrecy does not mean the birth of the informed citizen; nor does more control necessarily suggest more trust in public institutions.
For example, after American voters learned that President George W. Bush had led the United States into a war with Iraq without proof of weapons of mass destruction, they re-elected him.
Likewise, Italians kept Silvio Berlusconi in power for more than a decade, despite a steady stream of revelations about his wrongdoings.
In politics, “knowing everything” still means knowing different things, which means that compelling governments to disclose information does not necessarily mean that people learn more or understand better.
On the contrary, as soon as government information is designed to be immediately open to everybody, its value as information declines and its value as an instrument of manipulation increases.
Consider how gangsters in crime movies talk when they know that the police are listening.
They speak clearly and offer banalities while exchanging notes under the table.
That is government in the age of transparency.
In his study of truth-telling in ancient Greece, the philosopher Michel Foucault pointed out that the act of truth-telling cannot be reduced to citizens learning something that they did not know before.
Paradoxically, truth in politics is something that everybody knows, but that few dare to express.
People hardly need additional data to recognize, say, a rise in inequality or mistreatment of immigrants.
The WikiLeaks cables did not teach us anything qualitatively new about America’s policies.
Living in truth cannot be reduced to having access to full information.
It is people’s willingness to take personal risks and confront the powerful by daring to speak the truth, not the truth itself, that ultimately leads to change.
Moreover, information never comes without interpretation.
Reading the same raw data, Republicans and Democrats in the US, or secularists and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, will spin it differently, because policymaking cannot be divorced from decision-makers’ interests and values.
As the anthropologists Jean and John Comaroff put it, ours “is an age in which people almost everywhere seem preoccupied, simultaneously, with transparency and conspiracy.”
To see the ambiguity of the politics of trust, consider Russia’s recent experience.
In December 2011, the country’s parliamentary election triggered a civic explosion.
Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets of Moscow and other big cities to demand a fair vote and real choices in the subsequent presidential election.
The escalating crisis of legitimacy forced the government to invent imaginative ways to justify its power.
The central proposal was ingenious: the Kremlin proposed to guarantee the election’s fairness by installing webcams at all polling stations; every citizen could personally monitor the voting process.
As China’s Xinhua news agency enthusiastically reported: “From Kamchatka to Kaliningrad, and from Chechnya to Chukotka, more than 2.5 million net surfers registered to view live streaming from at least 188,000 webcams installed in more than 94,000 polling stations on Russian territory.”
In the words of one Finnish observer, it was “a landmark in the history of democracy and democratic elections.”
But, in a regime like Vladimir Putin’s, where the government decides who may be a candidate, the webcams would be farcical were they not also so intimidating.
Viewed from the West, they were perceived as a tool to keep the government under control by enabling people to watch what it was doing.
But, from the point of view of a post-Soviet voter living in the countryside, the webcam sent a different message: the government knows how you vote.
In a way, Putin succeeded twice: he looked transparent to the West and menacing to most of his own citizens.
The installation of the webcams was an act of simultaneous transparency and conspiracy.
The broader issue is transparency advocates’ insistence that open government can be reconciled with citizens’ privacy.
But might wholly transparent government imply a wholly transparent citizen?
As a rule, governments monitor people.
When that becomes transparent, so do those citizens who spoke with or were monitored by the government.
Contrary to the expectations of transparency advocates, greater disclosure of government information does not make public discourse more rational and less paranoid.
If anything, it fuels conspiracy theories (there is nothing more suspicious than the claim of absolute transparency).
Who can honestly say that public debate has become more rational and less paranoid when our governments have become more transparent?
Rather than restoring trust in democratic institutions, the transparency movement could accelerate the transformation of democratic politics into the management of mistrust.
In that case, one could imagine the replacement of representative democracy with political regimes that limit citizen control to the executive.
None of this is to deny that transparency in government is a worthy goal.
But let’s not fool ourselves by thinking that achieving it will restore citizens’ faith in their political institutions.

What Should Macron Do Now?
PARIS – Within Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron’s victory over the far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been broadly welcomed.
After all, although Le Pen abandoned her old idea of ditching the euro, she still views the European Union as a threat to French sovereignty – a force that prevents the government from protecting the French people from the perils of globalization.
Among other things, Le Pen wanted to reconsider the Franco-German alliance (the bedrock of the European project since its beginning), leave NATO’s integrated military command, and seek reconciliation with Russia, despite its invasion of Ukraine.
Her admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin is ideologically motivated: He supposedly defends Christian civilization against Muslims and shares her contempt for LGBT rights.
But the affinity is also psychological and financial.
Le Pen and the rest of the far right long for a strongman; and in 2014, her party received a €9.4 million ($10 million) loan from a Russian bank.
But while Macron’s 2017 victory over Le Pen triggered an outpouring of enthusiasm (the cover of The Economist depicted him walking on water), his re-election elicited only a sigh of relief.
Macron did not meet Europeans’ lofty expectations during his first term.
Some of his difficulties, such as the “yellow vests” (gilets jaunes) protests and the perception that he is a “president of the rich,” were of his own making.
Others, such as Donald Trump’s presidency in the United States, Brexit, and then COVID-19, confronted him with tests for which he was not always prepared.
With Europe confronting a savage war on its border, the new strategic landscape does not seem to favor Macron’s 2017 agenda.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, it precludes any French-Russian partnership in the coming years – at least while Putin is in charge.
This is a big change.
Ever since Charles de Gaulle and the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, engaging with the Kremlin has been a unique element of French security policy.
Owing to its own nuclear deterrent, France was always less fearful of Moscow, and less dependent on the US nuclear umbrella, than other European countries.
Allied but not always aligned with the US, successive French presidents viewed engagement with the Soviet Union, and then Russia, as a way to preserve France’s room for maneuver.
When Macron came to power in 2017, his goal was to push for European “strategic autonomy” – to make Europe less dependent on the US. This was necessary, he explained in 2019, because NATO was becoming “brain dead.”
But, thanks to Putin, NATO is now stronger and more united than it has been in decades.
Every European country recognizes that, where security is concerned, NATO is the only game in town, and the US remains the only force capable of deterring wider Russian aggression.
Though America’s strategic credibility was called into question by its shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, it has now been restored.
By making clear that the US will not deploy troops to protect a non-NATO country, US President Joe Biden has strengthened the incentive for countries like Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutrality and join the alliance.
Under these new circumstances, Macron’s previous plea for greater autonomy vis-à-vis the US suddenly seems rather foolish to many European leaders.
For now, it is the French project of European strategic autonomy that has become brain dead.
Restoring normal relations with the Kremlin would take years.
If Macron persists in pressing for autonomy, Europe will remain divided.
Beyond Europe, France’s efforts to help governments in Africa’s Sahel contain an Islamist rebellion are also running into trouble.
The fighting has already shattered the link between France and Mali, and victory against regional extremist groups is nowhere in sight.
The situation is similarly gloomy across Africa more broadly.
Not only is France no longer Africa’s cop; its prestige on the continent is quickly deteriorating.
The growing popularity of racist far-right figures in France is one reason for this; but another is that France has been less willing to maintain ties with authoritarian French-speaking regimes.
The situation in the Middle East and North Africa is also problematic.
Lebanon is mired in political and financial crises that Macron is powerless to resolve.
Algeria’s internal conflicts are hurting its relationship with France, despite Macron’s best efforts to reflect honestly on the legacy of colonialism and the brutal war of independence.
And, after long serving as an active participant in efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, France, like the rest of the international community, has largely given up that cause.
Where might Macron’s characteristic dynamism make an effective contribution?
The first area that comes to mind is the fight against climate change.
Having hosted the successful 2015 summit that produced the Paris climate agreement, France has a strong claim to global leadership on this issue.
Moreover, forward-looking green policies have become increasingly popular around the world, specifically among young people, whose support Macron needs to recapture.
Macron also will likely be a strong proponent of multilateralism, which has suffered in this age of populist nationalism.
The crisis of multilateralism is arguably at the heart of Europe and the world’s most pressing strategic problems today.
Here, too, France has a legitimate claim to leadership, given that Macron placed multilateralism at the heart of his campaign.
France is powerful enough to influence global affairs, but not to act unilaterally.
With his high global profile, Macron could work with Japan, Germany, India, and others to forge a united front in defense of the multilateral system.
Lastly, Macron’s France – working closely with Germany and the EU more broadly – can help to ensure that the confrontation between the West and Russia over Ukraine does not escalate into a more dangerous global confrontation between authoritarian and democratic countries.
That is the last thing France or Europe needs.

Neville Cameron?
LONDON – The European question is the grim reaper of British politics – dividing parties, debilitating governments, and destroying careers.
But never before have the stakes surrounding the question been so high.
Prime Minister David Cameron’s decision to hold a referendum – perhaps as early as June – on the United Kingdom’s continued membership in the European Union could bring down his government, destroy his political party, and literally tear his country apart.
Cameron is doing all he can to renegotiate the terms of membership in order to persuade voters to choose to remain in the EU.
But referendums are notoriously unpredictable.
And there is no reason to believe that the storms of populism blowing across the continent will not make landfall in the UK.
A decision to leave the EU would fall like a sledgehammer on the British economy and greatly diminish its international stature.
Far worse, it could lead to the dissolution of the UK.
The Scottish National Party has threatened to hold a second independence referendum if British voters decide to leave the EU.
This, the SNP’s leaders argue, would allow an independent Scotland to remain part of Europe, even as England, Wales, and Northern Ireland set out on their own.
Were this to happen, the dismemberment of the UK would make Cameron’s legacy the worst of any prime minister in British history.
That might seem like a high bar, given that the title is usually associated with Neville Chamberlain, who famously tried to appease Adolf Hitler.
But while the stakes were certainly higher in Chamberlain’s case, at least his polices could be reversed before they destroyed the country (and Winston Churchill did just that).
If Cameron loses both the EU and Scottish referendums, his successors will not be able to put the EU or the UK back together again.
As Cameron fights to save his party and his country, a line from Oscar Wilde resonates: “For each man kills the thing he loves.”
The prime minister’s predicament is that his political strength depends on his ability to stretch the Conservative Party’s blanket over its uneasy bedfellows of flag-waving nationalists and free-market fundamentalists; but the European question pits one side against the other.
For capital and big business, EU membership is an economic imperative, offering access to 500 million consumers and reserves of cheap, qualified labor.
For nationalists, it is a threat, undermining British sovereignty and control over the country’s borders.
Cameron’s call for a referendum, first issued when he was in opposition, was an attempt to appease both sides, allowing each to stick to their principles while promising to give voters the final say.
The trouble began when he became Prime Minister and was forced to pick a side.
Fortunately for Cameron, he has a lot going in his favor.
The facts are clear: the UK’s economy, security, and international stature all benefit from EU membership.
And broadly, the business community, trade unions, parliament, the media, and even a plurality of the British public all favor remaining in the EU.
Meanwhile, opponents of EU membership have yet to make the case for a credible alternative.
Moreover, Cameron has an impressive track record of exceeding expectations.
Few predicted he would take control of his party when he launched his leadership campaign in 2005.
When the Conservatives came to power in 2010, many doubted that he would serve a full term as Prime Minister.
And even Cameron himself did not expect to win an outright majority in last year’s general election.
But there is no guarantee that his winning streak will continue.
The news from Europe has been unrelentingly grim, and it could ultimately sway the result of the referendum.
The refugee crisis, terrorist attacks, and the lingering effects of the global economic crisis are all providing fuel for simmering nativist sentiment.
Worries over migration and the spectacle of a divided, dysfunctional Europe have benefited xenophobes and extremists across the continent.
And terrorist attacks, by their very nature, are intended to provoke irrational backlashes (as evidenced by a recent referendum in Denmark, in which voters unexpectedly rejected a proposal to modify the country’s opt-outs from certain EU home-affairs regulations).
Cameron’s allies say he has only two modes of operation: complacency and panic.
So far, he has faced his referendum challenge calmly.
But that is likely to change as the vote approaches and the risk grows that he will be remembered as the leader who, to paraphrase Churchill, was given a choice between his party and his country, chose his party, and ended up losing both.

Power to the People
MEXICO CITY – If you are reading this article, you most likely have electricity and heat at home and never think of that fact as at all remarkable. But over 2 billion people – one in three people on our planet – have no access to modern energy to light and heat the dwellings in which they live.
The obstacles to energy access are not technical.
We know how to build power systems, design modern cooking stoves, and meet energy demand efficiently.
What is missing is a global commitment to move energy access up the political and development agendas.
Half of the world’s population uses solid fuel, such as wood, charcoal, or dung, for cooking.
According to the World Health Organization, 1.6 million women and children die each year as a result of indoor smoke inhalation, more than from malaria.
Add the pollutant emissions from such stoves, together with the deforestation that results from using firewood, and you have several pressing global challenges that can be tackled at once by closing the energy gap.
Efforts to close this gap have so far been insufficient in scale and scope, but a plan of action now exists, developed in recent months by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC). The Group brings together top UN officials and business executives, including from Edison International, Statoil, Suntech Holdings, and Vattenfall.
Through this innovative public-private partnership, we analyzed global energy access and recommended in our resulting report that the international community commit to universal access to modern energy services by 2030.
The report also called for a 40% reduction in global energy intensity by 2030, which, if implemented, would reduce global energy intensity at approximately double the historical rate.
AGECC is now working on how best to deliver on the plan.
This was the focus of the Group’s last meeting, held on July 15 in Mexico City. It was hosted by the Carlos Slim Foundation, which works in support of implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in such areas as health, deforestation, and closing the digital divide.
Mexico will be the location for key UN climate talks later this year, and AGECC is interacting with the country’s energy ministry to ensure a coordinated and effective approach.
The financial implications of ensuring universal energy access are large, but not overwhelming when weighed against the enormous benefits.
The International Energy Agency estimates that, over the next two decades, ensuring universal access to electricity would require around 10% of total annual investment in the energy sector, which can be mobilized by the private sector.
Universal energy access is a new market opportunity, but one that needs the right support to thrive.
Many clean technologies are already available, so we are not talking about investing billions in research.
It is a question of transferring the technologies and adapting them to local conditions and needs.
But increasing energy access is not only about supplying better, more efficient cooking stoves or light bulbs.
To promote economic development and growth, energy services must also work in the interest of creating wealth and jobs by providing power for businesses and improving healthcare, education, and transportation.
In September, world leaders will meet at the UN to assess progress on the MDGs.
While there is no goal on energy, it is central to meeting the other MDGs, especially those concerning poverty and hunger, universal education, and environmental sustainability.
Governments alone will not be able to deal with all of these challenges.
We need a firm commitment from all sides: private businesses, academia, civil society, and international organizations and NGOs.
The deadline for delivering universal energy access is 2030.
Will you join us?

Turkey’s Critical Election
ISTANBUL – In very few democracies could such a small shift in votes lead to outcomes as different as the ones that could result from Turkey’s general election on June 7.
A swing of less than 1% of the national vote could decide whether the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is forced to form a coalition government – Turkey’s first after 13 years of single-party rule – leaving it unable to fulfill President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s longstanding desire to strengthen the presidency.
Turkish elections have been boring affairs since the AKP came to power in 2002. The party’s results have been all but preordained: landslide victories and majority governments.
This year, however, the outlook is different: the results are far from certain, and the stakes could hardly be higher.
Riding on the outcome is not only Erdoğan’s political future, but also the potential for a long-term settlement with the country’s Kurds and the long-term soundness of Turkish democracy itself.
The uncertainty this time around is attributable to the predominantly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP).
Kurdish political parties shied away from contesting past elections, owing to their fear of failing to clear the 10% popular-vote threshold needed to enter the parliament.
Instead, Kurdish politicians would run as independent candidates, who are not subject to the threshold. Once safely in office, they would reunite under the banner of a party.
This year, however, the Kurdish political movement has decided to field its candidates as members of a single party.
This electoral strategy, though risky, could yield large rewards, with the outcome holding significant implications for the party’s immediate fortune – as well as for Turkey’s long-term prospects.
The HDP’s failure to clear the 10% threshold would open the way for an overhaul of the country’s political system.
With the Kurds and their candidates excluded from the parliament, the AKP would have to do only slightly better than polls are predicting to maintain its political dominance.
If the party is able to secure more than 45% of the national vote, the quirks in Turkey’s electoral law will give it more than 330 representatives in the country’s 550-seat legislature.
Such a result would give Erdoğan the power to put in place the presidential system of governance that he has long sought.
The AKP’s parliamentary majority would allow the party to draft a new constitution unilaterally and put it to a referendum within a year.
At the same time, the country’s southeastern regions could become vulnerable to civil unrest, as the Kurdish movement – faced with a total lack of national political representation during a time of institutional transition – agitates for greater local autonomy.
If, on the other hand the HDP can reach the 10% threshold, its fortunes – and Erdoğan’s – will swing in the other direction.
The party’s candidates would command a sizable minority delegation in parliament, and the AKP would likely become the senior partner of a coalition government.
Far from securing a dominant position, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu would be forced to choose between aligning his party with the HDP or the conservative Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).
A grand coalition with the main opposition party, the center-left Republican People’s Party (CHP), though theoretically possible, is not congruous with Turkey’s political culture.
Such a result would empower the executive, headed by Davutoğlu, to the detriment of the presidency.
With the possibility that Erdoğan could become an executive president no longer realistic, his power would quickly begin to wane.
Even assuming that the AKP remained the country’s largest party, the balance of power in Turkish politics would start to turn against him.
In liberal democracies, national elections are intended to provide the winning side with a popular mandate to govern and to set policy priorities until the next election.
Only rarely do they hold implications that will last longer than a single electoral cycle.
But that is the case today in Turkey, where the outcome of the upcoming popular vote is likely to determine the rules of political life for years to come.
The HDP is currently polling at around 10%.
A little nudge in either direction could make all the difference in the world.

Tax-Cut Time for Germany?
MUNICH – A weakening economy has rekindled an old debate: does Germany need tangible tax relief for its workforce and enterprises in order to remain internationally competitive?
Or should taxes go up to provide more funds for social programs and public investment?
Higher taxes create more room for government expenditure, while lower taxes limit the state’s spending capacity.
The choice between these options is a political matter.
But one general approach that might garner cross-party support in Germany would be to ensure that the share of economic output claimed by the public sector neither increases nor decreases over the medium term.
In fact, the ratio of taxes and social-security contributions to GDP in Germany has been increasing for years.
A reference point for deciding the overall tax burden could be the year 2014, in which net new debt for the federal budget fell to zero.
At that time, tax revenue (including contributions) amounted to 38.6% of GDP.
By 2018, the ratio had risen to 39.8%.
Similarly, the tax-to-GDP ratio, excluding social contributions, has also increased significantly, from 22.1% in 2014 to 22.8% last year.
By 2020, it will exceed 23%.
The main reason for this is that inflation and earnings growth are pushing increasing numbers of income-tax payers into higher rate brackets.
Bringing the tax-to-GDP ratio back to its 2014 level would require tax relief in 2020 to the tune of €34 billion ($38 billion).
Even to reach the 2017 level, the government would have to lower the tax burden by €22 billion.
But which particular taxes should be cut?
Canceling the solidarity tax, a surcharge on income tax, would be a good place to start.
This tax was introduced on the understanding that it would be levied only temporarily to finance the reconstruction of the former East Germany following reunification.
Thirty years on, it’s time to make good on this promise.
The argument that the end of the solidarity tax would be an unwelcome “gift to the rich” skews the facts.
The truth is that its introduction was a special measure that predominantly hit the “rich.”
Any German political party eager to tax higher-wage earners more heavily should be campaigning to reform income-tax rates, not block the overdue retirement of the solidarity tax.
The view that it would make more sense to direct the money raised from the solidarity tax toward public investment is also unconvincing, because there is no shortage of funds available for investment.
At the same time, government final-consumption expenditure is increasing massively, and redistribution programs often fail to target the poor.
The failure of infrastructure projects in Germany owes more to protracted planning processes and resistance from local communities than to a lack of funds.
Urgent action is also required on corporate tax.
In Germany, the standard tax rate for companies’ retained earnings is around 30%, which is significantly higher than in similar countries.
Among the G7, only France’s 33% rate is higher, and this will drop to 28% in the coming years, with further reductions to 25% already agreed.
To prevent a reduction in tax revenue through companies shifting profits abroad, and to keep investment and jobs in Germany, the federal government should follow France’s lead and also gradually reduce the corporate-tax burden toward 25%.
Opponents of corporate-tax reform assert that Germany’s high export surplus shows there is no need to make its economy even more competitive.
But this is simply wrong.
Anyone making that argument is confusing companies’ export potential with Germany’s attractiveness as a location for investment and jobs.
Germany’s export surplus is accompanied by net capital exports, because more investments are being made abroad than at home.
Lowering corporate taxes would change that.
According to current estimates, if the tax rate were to drop from 30% to 25%, companies in Germany could increase investment by up to 14%.
What’s more, owing to reduced tax avoidance, profits recorded in Germany would rise by some 4%.
All in all, this means corporate-tax reforms could be roughly revenue-neutral.
And there is a final compelling argument for tax relief.
It would force German politicians to reexamine existing government expenditure and priorities, instead of always readily serving up new spending programs simply because abundant funds seem to be available.

How Trump Is Helping China
FRANKFURT – The Sino-American trade war, initiated early this year by US President Donald Trump’s administration, is escalating rapidly.
Already, the Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, and an additional 10% tariff on goods worth another $200 billion.
Unless the leaders of the two countries can strike a deal at next month’s G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, the situation is likely to worsen.
That’s better news for China than it is for the US.
So far, China has refused to bow to US pressure.
While it has retaliated, it has kept its actions proportionate, to avoid excessive escalation.
But there is no reason to think that the Trump administration – which has threatened tariffs on all Chinese products – will reverse course.
After all, Trump believes that a country with a bilateral trade deficit is necessarily being taken advantage of by its partner.
The reality, of course, is that whatever costs the US incurs from trade with China are vastly outweighed by the benefits.
For starters, thanks to low-cost imports from China, US consumers pay less for a wide range of goods, from shoes to electronics.
Moreover, the US runs a massive current-account deficit, meaning that it is borrowing much more from its foreign counterparts – especially China – than it is lending.
Without inflows of Chinese capital, the US Treasury would face higher interest rates, raising the cost of financing government debt and the cost of homeowners’ mortgages.
True, the trade deficit with China has cost the US jobs.
But those losses have been in low-wage positions, and have been offset by new employment in other areas.
According to a 2006 report by the US-China Business Council, the 500,000 manufacturing jobs lost over the subsequent four years would be offset by the same number of new service-sector jobs.
Whether these projections were met is another issue.
The key question is – and will always be – whether the US is able to upgrade its economic structure and ensure a fairer domestic distribution of the benefits of international trade.
This cost-benefit calculation is probably why successive US administrations were happy to run trade deficits with China, even if they pretended otherwise.
China’s government, too, was generally comfortable with the arrangement, though some Chinese economists have long warned that running a trade surplus with the US was not in China’s long-term interests, for a few key reasons.
For starters, running surpluses against the US implies accumulating foreign-exchange reserves.
As the late MIT economist Rudi Dornbusch pointed out, it makes more sense for residents of poor countries to invest their resources at home in ways that raise productivity and living standards, rather than buying US Treasury bills.
Yet when China began running a continuous trade surplus, its per capita income was just above $400.
Moreover, though China is among the world’s leading recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI), it has failed to translate all that capital into a current-account deficit that would finance increased domestic investment and/or consumption.
Instead, by continuing to run a current-account surplus, China has established an irrational international investment position: despite having accumulated some $2 trillion in net foreign assets, it has been running an investment-income deficit for more than a decade.
Not only do US Treasuries produce meager returns; they are also less safe than they appear.
After all, the US Federal Reserve could always decide that its debt burden has grown too heavy, and attempt to inflate it away by printing more dollars.
Under more extreme circumstances, it could even sequester China’s dollar-denominated foreign assets.
In short, China has outgrown the world market, and its economy is desperately in need of rebalancing.
Though the country has made significant progress on this front since 2008, its total trade-to-GDP ratio (37%) and export-to-GDP ratio (18%) remain significantly higher than those of the US, Japan, and other large economies.
It is worth mentioning, however, that a rapid deterioration of China’s current account will pose a serious challenge to the country.
If China must reduce its trade surplus with the US, it must also reduce its trade deficits with the East Asian economies.
The impact of such a rebalancing on the global economy could be very grave indeed.
China needs to stop accumulating foreign-exchange reserves.
If it is to amass foreign assets, they should be more profitable than US Treasury bills.
In any case, China should also reduce costly foreign liabilities.
To that end, it must balance its imports and exports, while leveling the playing field for foreign corporations operating within its market by eliminating the incentives for local governments to compete for FDI regardless of cost, or to engage in other forms of undue intervention.
Last but not least, China certainly will make a bigger effort in indigenous innovation and creation to reduce its dependence on foreign technology, which has never been easy to obtain and will be increasingly difficult to secure.
These objectives are not new to the Chinese authorities.
But, thanks to Trump’s trade war, policymakers are now pursuing them with a new sense of urgency.
In that sense, the trade war may end up being a blessing in disguise for China.
In 2005, when the US government was pressing China to allow the renminbi to appreciate, Phillip Swagel, a former member of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote: “If China’s currency is undervalued by 27%, as some have claimed, US consumers have been getting a 27% discount on everything made in China, while the Chinese have been paying 27% too much for Treasury bonds.”
US policymakers, Swagel asserted, surely understood that, and they “certainly must realize that their very public campaign only makes it more difficult for the Chinese to take action.”
But, as Swagel acknowledged, maybe that was the point.
The US push for China to let the renminbi appreciate was “a devious attempt” to sustain the “enormous benefits” the US derived, at China’s expense, from the fixed exchange rate.
Even if this was an accident, the end result was “a brilliant strategy to keep the good times rolling.”
With Trump, those good times may be about to come to an end.
Trump claims that the “trade war” with China “was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the US.”
But it is he who most likely will be remembered as the fool – a bungling, capricious leader whose attacks on China only made that economy stronger, at least partly at America’s expense.

America’s Race to the Ballot’s Bottom
WASHINGTON, DC – Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign has been torn between trying to secure the largest possible victory for the candidate herself and explicitly helping fellow Democratic gubernatorial and legislative candidates further down the ballot.
It’s an open question whether Clinton could do more for down-ballot candidates by winning decisively – so that the enthusiasm trickles down – or by expending time and money to help those candidates individually.
The Clinton camp has decided to pursue both strategies.
With just a week left before the election, the presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country: whereas Republican nominee Donald Trump is struggling to cobble together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, Clinton is trying to lock up as large a victory – in both the popular vote and the Electoral College – as possible.
Just a week ago, Clinton seemed to be heading toward an overwhelming victory.
But on October 28, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress announcing that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State.
The reason?
Thousands of emails had been discovered on the laptop of the estranged husband of Clinton’s closest assistant, Huma Abedin, during a separate inquiry into his own activities.
(No, this isn’t a movie plot.)
Comey’s announcement triggered an uproar, but it hasn’t so far had a notable impact on the race.
The Clinton campaign has not given up even on winning states that have long been considered Republican strongholds, such as Arizona, Georgia, and Utah.
And Trump, despite feeling invigorated by the discovery, has continued to pursue states, such as New Mexico, that would do him little good in the Electoral College count.
But Trump, new to politics, fancies himself a great political strategist.
Trump has few political allies to help him out, while Clinton’s many surrogates include her husband, former President Bill Clinton; President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, the breakout star of this election; and Vice President Joe Biden and Clinton’s vice-presidential running mate, Tim Kaine.
Two stars of the left, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have also campaigned for Clinton; if she wins, they will call in the debt both in policy terms and on appointees.
Meanwhile, Clinton has appeared with Democratic Senate candidates who are challenging incumbent Republicans, including Katie McGinty, who is running to oust Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania; Governor Maggie Hassan, who hopes to topple Senator Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire; and Deborah Ross, who is mounting a strong challenge to Senator Richard Burr in North Carolina.
The Clinton campaign has poured money into several Senate, House of Representatives, gubernatorial, and even state-legislature races, and Clinton field workers and volunteers have been encouraged to help down-ballot candidates in contentious races.
Obama, for his part, recently recorded a series of video endorsements for Democrats running for the Senate, the House, and state legislatures.
Numerous pundits say that the FBI announcement will help Republicans down-ballot, but that’s pure speculation.
If Clinton wins the White House and many Republican incumbents are swept out of office, the US will have had a “wave” election.
But we likely won’t know if this is happening until the last minute.
In the 1980 wave election, when Ronald Reagan and the Republican ticket overwhelmed President Jimmy Carter and toppled several liberal Democrats in the Senate, the presidential race was nearly tied until the final weekend.
Even if the Democrats retake the Senate in a wave, the honeymoon won’t last long.
In two years, another third of the Senate will be up for reelection, and far more Democrats than Republicans will have to defend their seats – a reversal of the situation this year.
Of course, the Clinton campaign isn’t just being charitable by helping down-ballot candidates.
Her administration will be far better off with more Democrats in Congress.
The Democrats are still widely expected to retake the Senate, though not the House, where they would need to flip an unlikely 30 Republican seats.
(Most House seats are gerrymandered, with district boundaries manipulated to benefit the incumbent party.) But even if the Democrats do regain a majority in the 100-member Senate, Republicans will still be able to hold the threat of a filibuster – which requires 60 votes to break – over Clinton’s legislative proposals and nominations to the executive branch and Supreme Court.
There’s another important reason for the Clinton campaign and its high-profile surrogates to help down-ballot Democrats.
Both parties want to strengthen their hold on as many state-level offices as possible, because the party that controls a state’s governorship and at least one of its legislative chamber gets to oversee how congressional districts are drawn (which happens every ten years).
How districts are drawn affects the partisan makeup of the House, and therefore the fate of federal legislation.
(Only the Senate votes on presidential nominations.)
The states are also where the parties can build their bench of potential future federal officeholders.
The Republicans figured out the importance of state-level politics long before the Democrats, and they have built a much stronger foundation in the states than the Democrats have.
For example, even though Obama carried Ohio in the last two elections, its current congressional delegation is 75% Republican.
The US election is now a volatile affair.
No one knows what might pop up next to shake up the race, but it is sensible to assume that something will.
At the very least, the WikiLeaks disclosures will presumably continue, though, despite being somewhat embarrassing to the Clintons, they haven’t revealed corruption by the Clinton Foundation or improprieties in how Hillary Clinton conducted policy as Secretary of State.
By the time Comey sent his letter, several million Americans had already cast their ballots.
We cannot know how the various disclosures will affect turnout between now and Election Day.
What we do know is that, ultimately, nothing that has or might happen makes Trump better suited for the presidency than Clinton.

On the Cusp of an AI Revolution
SAN FRANCISCO – Over the last 30 years, consumers have reaped the benefits of dramatic technological advances.
In many countries, most people now have in their pockets a personal computer more powerful than the mainframes of the 1980s.
The Atari 800XL computer that I developed games on when I was in high school was powered by a microprocessor with 3,500 transistors; the computer running on my iPhone today has two billion transistors.
Back then, a gigabyte of storage cost $100,000 and was the size of a refrigerator; today it’s basically free and is measured in millimeters.
Even with these massive gains, we can expect still faster progress as the entire planet – people and things – becomes connected.
Already, five billion people have access to a mobile device, and more than three billion people can access the Internet.
In the coming years, 50 billion things – from light bulbs to refrigerators, roads, clothing, and more – will be connected to the Internet as well.
Every generation or so, emerging technologies converge, and something revolutionary occurs.
For example, a maturing Internet, affordable bandwidth and file-compression, and Apple’s iconic iPhone enabled companies such as Uber, Airbnb, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to redefine the mobile-customer experience.
Now we are on the cusp of another major convergence: big data, machine learning, and increased computing power will soon make artificial intelligence, or AI, ubiquitous.
AI follows Albert Einstein’s dictum that genius renders simplicity from complexity.
So, as the world itself becomes more complex, AI will become the defining technology of the twenty-first century, just as the microprocessor was in the twentieth century.
Consumers already encounter AI on a daily basis.
Google uses machine learning to autocomplete search queries and often accurately predicts what someone is looking for.
Facebook and Amazon use predictive algorithms to make recommendations based on a user’s reading or purchasing history.
AI is the central component in self-driving cars – which can now avoid collisions and traffic congestion – and in game-playing systems like Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo, a computer that beat South Korean Go master Lee Sedol in a five-game match earlier this year.
Given AI’s wide applications, all companies today face an imperative to integrate it into their products and services; otherwise, they will not be able to compete with companies that are using data-collection networks to improve customer experiences and inform business decisions.
The next generation of consumers will have grown up with digital technologies and will expect companies to anticipate their needs and provide instant, personalized responses to any query.
So far, AI has been too costly or complex for many businesses to make optimal use of it.
It can be difficult to integrate into a business’s existing operations, and historically it has required highly skilled data scientists.
As a result, many businesses still make important decisions based on instinct instead of information.
This will change in the next few years, as AI becomes more pervasive, potentially making every company and every employee smarter, faster, and more productive.
Machine learning algorithms can analyze billions of signals to route customer service calls automatically to the most appropriate agent or determine which customers are most likely to purchase a particular product.
And AI’s applications extend beyond online retail: Brick-and-mortar stores still account for 90% of retail sales, according to the consultancy A.T. Kearney.
Soon, when customers enter a physical store, they will be greeted by interactive chat-bots that can recommend products based on shopping history, offer special discounts, and handle customer-service issues.
Advances in so-called “deep learning,” a branch of AI modeled after the brain’s neural network, could enable intelligent digital assistants to help plan vacations with the acumen of a human assistant, or determine consumer sentiments toward a particular brand, based on millions of signals from social networks and other data sources.
In health care, deep-learning algorithms could help doctors identify cancer-cell types or intracranial abnormalities from anywhere in the world in real time.
To deploy AI effectively, companies will need to keep privacy and security in mind.
Because AI is fueled by data, the more data the machine gains about an individual, the better it can predict their needs and act on their behalf.
But, of course, that massive flow of personal data could be appropriated in ways that breach trust.
Companies will have to be transparent about how they use people’s personal data.
AI can also detect and defend against digital security breaches, and will play a critical role in protecting user privacy and building trust.
As in past periods of economic transformation, AI will unleash new levels of productivity, augment our personal and professional lives, and pose existential questions about the age-old relationship between man and machine.
It will disrupt industries and dislocate workers as it automates more tasks.
But just as the Internet did 20 years ago, AI will also improve existing jobs and spawn new ones.
We should expect this and adapt accordingly by providing training for the jobs of tomorrow, as well as safety nets for those who fall behind.
AI is still a long way from surpassing human intelligence.
It has been 60 years since John McCarthy, a computer scientist and nominal father of AI, first introduced the term during a conference at Dartmouth College, and computers have only recently been able to detect cats in YouTube videos or determine the best route to the airport.
We can count on technological innovation to continue at an even more rapid pace than in previous generations.
AI will become like electrical current – invisible and augmenting almost every part of our lives.
Thirty years from now, we will wonder how we ever got along without our seemingly telepathic digital assistants, just as today it’s already hard to imagine going more than a few minutes without checking the 1980s mainframe in one’s pocket.

Europe’s Doom Loop in Reverse
BRUSSELS – During the 2011-2012 euro crisis, the currency area became mired in a “doom loop,” in which weak banks in financially distressed countries rationed credit, causing a recession that intensified pressure on government finances, which were already burdened by the need to cover banks’ losses.
But such self-reinforcing spirals can also operate in the opposite direction.
Understanding these dynamics may be the key to determining the eurozone’s relative strength today.
In a doom loop, the expectations of default drive up risk premia until the economy reaches the brink of collapse, even if the underlying problems could be managed over time.
At a certain point, when the gulf between financial-market pessimism and economic reality becomes too large, the market becomes ready for a reversal.
This was the case for the eurozone during the summer of 2012.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s pledge to do “whatever it takes” to prevent the euro from disintegrating reassured markets so effectively because investors’ fear was largely based, to paraphrase US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on “fear itself.”
Draghi’s intervention marked the start of a new cycle: the doom loop reversed, and became a benign credit cycle in which lower risk premia allowed both banks and governments to refinance at lower rates, making more credit available to the economy and thereby fueling a recovery that increased government revenue.
Governments in most of the eurozone countries that had previously been stuck in the doom loop were able to stabilize public finances without further expenditure cuts.
But this positive credit cycle is less visible than the doom loop, because it takes a lot less time to cut the number of borrowers and push the economy into a recession than to foster a recovery when credit becomes available again.
Even if over-stretched borrowers can spend and invest, they most likely won’t do so right away.
But, given time, easier credit conditions rarely fail to generate a recovery.
The ECB’s vast program of quantitative easing (QE), initiated in March 2015, reinforced the virtuous cycle.
But the truth is that the doom loop had been reversed long before QE began.
In any case, the common definition of that program – the large-scale purchase of government bonds by the ECB – is inaccurate.
The ECB General Council makes the key decisions, but its policy is executed mostly by national central banks (NCBs).
Normally, all NCBs in the euro system undertake the same operations, and the results are pooled.
But, when it comes to QE, each NCB buys only the bonds of its own government on its own account.
The Banca d’Italia has bought only Italian government bonds, and the Bundesbank only German Bunds.
NCBs are part of their respective countries’ larger public sectors, and eventually transfer all of the profits or losses from these transactions back to their own government.
So when they purchase long-term government bonds, they are acting like a subsidiary of a large corporation buying the debt of its parent company (issuing short-term liabilities to itself).
In short, the eurozone’s QE program amounts essentially to a massive asset-liability management exercise, in which (national) public debt is reshuffled from one part of the public sector (governments) to another part (the national central bank).
While the sums involved are very large – a total of about €2 trillion ($2.44 trillion) so far – the real impact is minor.
Of course, the ECB claims that the QE program contributed decisively to the recovery.
But the fact is that there has been little change in interest rates or risk spreads since the bond purchases started.
This indicates that the end of QE – which is likely to come later this year – will not mean the end of the recovery.
And, given that financial markets know that QE will end, they have already priced in that expectation.
But can today’s benign credit cycle last much longer?
There may be some reason for concern; after all, the eurozone experienced a similar self-reinforcing cycle of easy credit, growth, and little pressure on government finances before the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
But it seems unlikely that the current cycle will lead to similar excesses and end in a similar bust, because the growth pattern in the peripheral eurozone countries has changed considerably.
During the pre-crisis credit boom, growth in countries like Spain and Portugal was based largely on domestic demand, financed by capital inflows.
In Italy, domestic demand was less exuberant, but foreign capital was still needed at the margin to finance a large public debt.
So when capital inflows suddenly stopped, these economies were thrown into crisis.
Today, however, growth in these countries is based mainly on exports, while domestic demand remains subdued.
Moreover, these countries are maintaining current-account surpluses while their growth rates rise; in other words, far from relying on fickle capital inflows, they are repaying their external debt.
This new, more robust growth model could be sustained until the remaining unemployment is absorbed.
No financial cycle lasts forever.
But the one driving today’s recovery in the eurozone, including the peripheral countries that were hardest hit by the crisis, may be set to persist for a while yet.

Europe’s New Green Identity
PARIS – Most countries’ flags are multicolor.
Together with red-flagged China, the blue-flagged European Union is one of the few monochrome entities.
Not anymore, apparently: the EU’s new defining project colors it green.
At a meeting in mid-December, the leaders of all EU countries except one (Poland, not the United Kingdom) officially endorsed the goal of achieving climate neutrality – zero net emissions of greenhouse gases – by 2050.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to go further. Next March, she plans to introduce a “climate law” to ensure that all European policies are geared toward the climate neutrality objective.
She wants member states to agree next summer to cut emissions by about 50-55% between 2017 and 2030.
She also proposes to allocate half of the European Investment Bank’s funding and a quarter of the EU budget to climate-related objectives, and to devote €100 billion ($111 billion) to supporting regions and sectors most affected by decarbonization.
If non-EU countries drag their feet, she intends to propose a carbon tariff.
Grand plans for a distant future rightly elicit skepticism.
For leaders facing reelection every four or five years, a 2050 objective is hardly binding.
A battle is to be expected: opposition by fossil fuel-producing member states, energy-intensive sectors, trade-sensitive industries, and car-dependent households will be fierce.
The EU has already invested so much of its political capital into the green transition, however, that a failure to deliver would severely damage its legitimacy.
The Green Deal is not just one of many EU projects. It is the Union’s new defining mission.
Let us therefore assume that the EU commits to von der Leyen’s plan.
Will it work?
Relative to what other big emitters have agreed to do, the proposed EU target is commendably ambitious. Yet it falls short of what is needed to safeguard the world’s climate.
To prevent the rise in temperature from crossing the safe threshold of 1.5º Celsius, future global cumulative emissions must be limited to about seven times the current level.
At prevailing emission levels (which are still rising), humanity’s total carbon budget will be exhausted in seven years.
The additional carbon budget the EU is setting itself with its super-ambitious plan amounts to roughly 15 years of current-level emissions (somewhat less if efforts are front-loaded).
Given that developing countries should be allocated a proportionally larger budget than advanced economies, global emissions would remain far too high even if all countries suddenly emulated the EU.
The sad truth is that the 1.5º target is already out of reach, and the EU’s laudable plan is a bare minimum.
Is the plan realistic?
That is hard to say at this early stage, but it is already clear that the full range of required policy tools cannot be mobilized at the EU level alone.
The Union decides on allowances for energy-intensive industries and car-emission standards, but it cannot rule directly on the member states’ energy mix, housing standards, taxes, and public investment.
Much will depend on national ownership of the common targets, which currently is unequal, to say the least: CO2 emissions are taxed at €113 per ton in Sweden and €45 in France, but they are tax-exempt in Germany and Italy.
Designing and enforcing a common EU strategy will be a difficult fight.
Frustrated climate advocates often put their faith in financial instruments.
Having lost the battle for tough regulation and dissuasive taxation, their hope is that green finance will do the job.
It is true that an increasing number of investors shy away from “brown” assets, either by choice or because of regulators’ warning that oil fields and coal plants may lose much of their value and end up as “stranded” assets.
And it is true that favorable regulatory treatment of climate-friendly investment, de-risking through financial engineering, and credit subsidies can spur green capital formation.
Even central bankers are actively debating what to do to for the climate.
But such techniques are rather inefficient.
Financial dissuasion may help curb dirty investments, and a panoply of incentives may help promote clean ones, but at a high economic cost.
As long as the climate policy is not fully credible, each ton of greenhouse gas saved will entail more output losses than if tomorrow’s carbon price were predictable.
And as purchase subsidies for cleaner vehicles have shown, support for green technologies, if not coupled with carbon taxation, may well end up prompting higher energy consumption.
To be sure, decarbonization cannot rely on first-best policies alone. But experience has shown that it is fairly easy to burn through lots of money with little to show for it.
And public support for mitigating climate change is not such that price is not an issue.
At the end of the day, success will largely depend on whether the greening of the economy helps create jobs and prosperity.
The European Commission claims that the Green Deal is Europe’s “new growth strategy.”
This will enrage supporters of “de-growth.”
But the Commission is right to emphasize that decarbonization and growth must go hand in hand.
The transition to carbon neutrality will destroy wealth, cause job losses in energy-intensive sectors, and require lifestyle changes.
It will elicit sufficient support to overcome opposition only if it generates economic dynamism.
The Commission claims that its plan will spur €260 billion of additional investment annually.
The details can be discussed, but as a rough estimate of what is needed, the figure seems reasonable.
Yet this investment will materialize only on the basis of a sustained, all-encompassing, and credible implementation of what is still a blueprint.
When the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés landed in Veracruz, Mexico, 500 years ago, he ordered his troops to burn their ships. Only then could the meager unit truly understand that victory was the only option.
By announcing its new Green Deal, the EU has done much the same thing.

The ECB’s New Stealth Mandate
STANFORD – The European Central Bank’s monetary policy has undergone a peculiar change during the pandemic.
Something other than the goal of price stability appears to be guiding the bank’s overall approach, suggesting that it has adopted a new mandate without publicly announcing it.
Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, the ECB has succeeded in closing the gap between northern and southern member states’ borrowing costs, bringing eurozone North-South yield spreads to historic lows.
And with Europe facing multiple threats to its unity – from Donald Trump’s administration and Vladimir Putin’s revanchist Kremlin to an increasingly assertive China and homegrown populists – policymakers have effectively adopted “spread narrowing” as a new mandate.
ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues seem to recognize that ensuring European unity and solidarity is the most important objective an institution like the ECB can pursue at this critical moment.
Though no one at the bank is likely to admit it, there is little question that they are now in the business of holding down spreads.
By purchasing massive quantities of periphery member-state bonds through its quantitative-easing policy and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), the ECB has driven up the demand for riskier bonds in the market.
As a result, yields on ten-year sovereign bonds issued by Portugal and Spain have dropped below zero, and Italy’s bond yields have fallen to a decade low.
Lagarde’s leadership team has had much more success closing the North-South interest-rate spread than it has in meeting the ECB’s price-stability mandate of “below, but close to 2%” annual inflation.
Perhaps this reflects the ECB Governing Council’s recognition that the inflation target is unattainable without more fiscal stimulus.
Of course, even if the ECB has adopted a “what’s the use?” attitude with respect to the inflation target, that does not explain its persistent refusal to cut the discount rate even in the face of one of the biggest shocks to economic activity in living memory.
At the Governing Council’s most recent meeting, it refused to cut the discount rate from -0.5%, thereby creating the effect of a counterproductive rate increase.
On balance, this approach has catapulted the euro to its highest levels since 2018, and caused eurozone inflation to plunge even further from the ECB’s target in what is now the fourth consecutive month of falling prices.
The unstated reason for this strategy is plain as day: The ECB is focused on improving conditions for banks in the eurozone’s periphery countries and believes that cutting the discount rate would compound these banks’ problems.
Despite significant improvements in their financial health, banks in periphery countries remain very concerned about the fallout of the current crisis.
But this problem should sort itself out as southern economies recover.
For the time being, then, the prudent response to the ECB’s neglect of its inflation mandate is, “Who cares?”
Narrowing North-South yield spreads is far more important for Europe’s survival and future prosperity than are a few ticks on a price index.
After all, just look at the results.
The new mandate that dare not speak its name has prevented the euro from unraveling as a result of the pandemic – a possibility that many feared early on.
It has put the eurozone on a rock-solid footing, deepening European financial integration and solidarity (which has made the weakest members’ bonds increasingly attractive to international investors) just in time for the second wave of infections.
Spread-narrowing policies were perhaps the most important actions taken at the Governing Council’s meeting last week, when it launched a fresh round of stimulus, promising to buy €500 billion ($608 billion) more in bonds by expanding the PEPP from €1.35 trillion to €1.85 trillion.
At the same time that it shifts focus from its inflation target, the ECB is acting with steady purpose when it comes to spread stability.
Lagarde’s own role in the ECB’s new direction has been somewhat ambiguous.
In March, she remarked at an ECB press conference that it was not the bank’s job to narrow the gap in borrowing costs between stronger and weaker eurozone economies.
But that comment triggered a selloff in the bond markets, forcing ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane to get on the phone with leading financial institutions to ensure that there was no misunderstanding about ECB policy.
For her part, Lagarde’s position now is very different from the one she expressed earlier in the year.
In fact, she sounds much less like her March self, and more like French President Emmanuel Macron, for whom support of the periphery countries and North-South integration has always been a matter of primary concern.
Whatever her initial position, Lagarde recovered quickly and has become the leader the ECB needs.
Macron’s fingerprints may or may not be all over the new de facto spread-narrowing strategy, but myopic technocrats no longer have exclusive control over ECB policymaking.
Politicians with a deep understanding of what Europe needs are having a tangible influence, and the overall results are more than satisfactory.

Requiem for the Stiff Upper Lip
LONDON – The late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and husband to the queen, was long celebrated (or parodied) for his distinctive personality.
Before his death on April 9, at the age of 99, he was the United Kingdom’s grand, grumpy, and eccentric uncle – a man totally out of step with the modern world.
To take just one of many notorious examples, Philip couldn’t understand why servicemen today would need therapy.
Back in World War II, he observed, “We didn’t have counselors rushing around every time somebody let off a gun, asking ‘Are you all right?
Are you sure you don’t have a ghastly problem?’
You just got on with it.”
If Philip’s passing means that we also will be burying the iconic image of the British “stiff upper lip,” should we mourn that loss as well?
There was a time when this characteristically British display of stoic resolve was widely admired.
When the UK was the world’s leading power, it seemed to owe its position to a “mustn’t grumble” approach to life.
And, of course, this attitude was on full display when Britain resisted a Nazi onslaught that had already swept over its European neighbors.
In March 1912, the explorer Captain Lawrence Oates joined a British Antarctic expedition seeking to be first to the South Pole.
The mission failed, and Oates, suffering from gangrene and frostbite, begged his companions to leave him and save themselves.
When they refused, he casually said, “I am just going outside and may be some time.”
He never returned to the group’s tent, but his last words lived on, stiffening upper lips throughout the realm.
It is impossible to imagine Oates’ generation venting about anything with Oprah Winfrey.
But Philip’s grandson, Prince Harry, recently did precisely that.
Has the UK lost its claim to being the strong, silent type?
Psychologists have established that different national cultures do indeed exhibit and inculcate distinct attitudes and ways of life.
Most Nordic European, Anglo, and Latin American countries have been found to have highly “indulgent” cultures (preferring leisure and a higher quality of life), whereas East Asian countries tend to place less value on leisure and more on a strong work ethic.
In recent cross-country comparisons based on psychological tests, Vietnamese, Singaporeans, Japanese, and South Koreans demonstrate a high propensity to exercise restraint relative to Britons and Americans.
From these findings, one can infer that the first countries to industrialize and deliver affluence and comfort to their populations also may be the first to succumb to decadence, abandoning the ethic that drove their initial growth.
In the past, physical endurance, determination, and fortitude were the defining characteristics of those who succeeded in staking a claim on the world.
But today, success comes to those who can promote their brand or schmooze a venture capitalist.
Traditional “masculine” attitudes are no longer revered, and often are outright scorned (sometimes for very good reasons).
Being likable – something to which Philip certainly never aspired – has become the sine qua non of career success.
By contrast, Oates, before his untimely death, was known to be argumentative with the leader of the expedition, Captain Robert Falcon Scott, which would be career suicide today.
Even if today’s social tensions and conflicts are different than in the past, might Philip’s cool unflappability still have something to recommend it?
In psychological parlance, Philip’s character type was that of a “repressor”: he was good at suppressing any negativity within himself, and convincing others that he was in peak form.
The opposite personality type is often associated with a trait that is very much in vogue: “emotional intelligence” (EI), the ability to discern how others truly feel.
And yet, recent research finds that repressors still come out with the highest EI scores on academic psychological tests, implying that those who show no emotion may be exerting more skill or psychological effort than is commonly realized.
Beneath their placid brows lies a constant weighing of whether and when it is appropriate to vent one’s spleen.
Of course, while hiding one’s true mental state from others can lead to more successful social interactions, the effort not to burden others with one’s emotional baggage can of course be taken to extremes.
The danger for repressors is that they can delude themselves about how they really feel.
While “emoters” pursue psychological assistance from others early and often, repressors do so too late, if ever.
Hence, while South Korea ranks higher than the UK on personal restraint, it also scores much higher in suicides as a proportion of its population.
And despite its superior handling of the pandemic, South Korea’s pandemic-induced increase in suicides and self-harm has been much higher than that of Western countries that failed to control the virus.
The key, as in most things, is to strike the right balance.
In his consummate display of emotional moderation, Philip perhaps had something to teach us after all.
Upon getting stuck in an elevator at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, he is reported to have quipped that “this could only happen in a technical college.”
Now that he is gone, we should reserve a place for his style of irascible wit.
We may find it useful in our next crisis.

Are We Prepared for a Multipolar World Economy?
WASHINGTON, DC – At a time when the global economy is suffering from a crisis of confidence, structural imbalances, and subdued growth prospects, looking ahead ten years to predict the course of development requires careful modeling and something beyond sagacity.
What is needed is a multifaceted approach that combines a sense of history with careful analysis of current forces such as the shift in the balance of global growth toward the emerging world.
Such forecasting also requires an understanding of how advanced economies are coming to grips with that shift, and how the international monetary system will adjust as a result.
Having studied these factors, we believe that the world economy is on the verge of a transformative change – the transition to a multipolar world economic order.
Throughout history, paradigms of economic power have been drawn and redrawn according to the rise and fall of those countries best equipped to drive global growth and provide stimulus to the global economy.
Multipolarity, meaning more than two dominant growth poles, has at times been a key feature of the world economy.
But at no time in modern history have developing countries been at the forefront of a multipolar economic system.
This pattern is set to change.
By 2025, six emerging economies – Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Russia – will collectively account for about one-half of global growth.
The international monetary system is likely to cease being dominated by a single currency over the same years.
As they pursue growth opportunities abroad and are encouraged by improved polices at home, emerging-market corporations will play an increasingly prominent role in global business and cross-border investment, while large pools of capital within their borders will allow emerging economies to become key players in financial markets.
As dynamic emerging economies evolve to take their place at the helm of the world economy, a rethink of the conventional approach to global economic governance is needed.
The current approach rests on three premises: the link between concentrated economic power and stability; the North-South axis of capital flows; and the centrality of the US dollar.
Since the end of World War II, the US-centered global economic order has been built on a complementary set of tacit economic and security arrangements between the United States and its core partners, with emerging economies playing a peripheral role.
In exchange for the US assuming the responsibilities of system maintenance, serving as market of last resort, and accepting the international role of the dollar, its key economic partners, Western Europe and Japan, acquiesced in the special privileges enjoyed by the US – seigniorage gains, domestic macroeconomic-policy autonomy, and balance-of-payments flexibility.
Broadly, this arrangement still holds today, though hints of its erosion became evident some time ago.
The benefits that emerging economies have reaped from expanding their presence in international trade and finance are but one example of this.
An increasingly multipolar global economy is likely to change the way the world conducts international business.
A number of dynamic emerging-market firms are on a path toward dominating their industrial sectors globally in the coming years – much in the same way that companies based in advanced economies have done for the past half-century.
In the years ahead, such firms are likely to press for economic reforms at home, serving as a force for increased integration of their home countries into global trade and finance.
So the time may be ripe to move forward with the sort of multilateral framework for regulating cross-border investment that has been derailed several times since the 1920’s.
In contrast to international trade and monetary relations, no multilateral regime exists to promote and govern cross-border investment.
For now, the US dollar remains the most important international currency.
But this dominance is waning, as evidenced by its declining use as an official reserve currency, as well as for invoicing goods and services, denominating international claims, and anchoring exchange rates.
The euro represents the dollar’s strongest competitor, so long as the eurozone successfully addresses its current sovereign-debt crisis through bailouts and longer-term institutional reforms that safeguard the gains from a long-running single-market project.
But developing countries’ currencies will undoubtedly become more prominent in the longer term.
The size and dynamism of China’s economy, and the rapid globalization of its corporations and banks, makes the renminbi especially likely to take on a more important international role.
In Global Development Horizons 2011, the World Bank presents what it believes to be the most probable global currency scenario in 2025 – a multicurrency arrangement centered on the dollar, euro, and renminbi.
This scenario is buttressed by the likelihood that the US, the eurozone, and China will constitute the three major growth poles at that time.
Finally, the international financial community must live up to its responsibility to ensure that the development agenda remains a priority.
Countries with global economic clout have a special responsibility to accept that their policy actions have important spillover effects on other countries.
Monetary-policy initiatives that emphasize increased collaboration among central banks to achieve financial stability and sustainable growth in global liquidity thus would be particularly welcome.
Despite the considerable progress that developing countries have made in integrating themselves into international trade and finance channels, there is still much work to be done to ensure that they share the burden of maintaining the global system in which they have a rapidly growing stake.
At the same time, it is critical that major developed countries craft policies that take into account their growing interdependency with developing countries.
More and more, global governance will depend on leveraging that interdependency to strengthen international cooperation and boost worldwide prosperity.

Democracy Under Siege in America
NEW YORK – Recent challenges to democratic institutions and processes in the United States have raised fundamental political and legal questions to which all liberal democracies must have convincing answers.
When should military leaders refuse to follow presidential orders that they believe are unconstitutional?
At what point do police take responsibility for the delegitimizing effect of racism?
Why must journalists place the truth above the appearance of neutrality?
And when should words or images deliberately used in defiance of demonstrable facts lose legal protections?
The challenges confronting the US provide some guidance.
General Mark Milley, America’s top military official, was right to apologize for participating in President Donald Trump’s imperious walk across Lafayette Square in Washington, DC. Not only had tear gas and rubber bullets been used to clear the area of peaceful protesters, but Trump was obviously using the military as a pawn in domestic politics.
Similarly, there is reason to agree with Detroit Police Chief James Craig’s use of the word “murder” to describe the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, an unarmed black man.
The offending officer and his three colleagues should have known that pressing one’s knee on someone’s neck for over eight minutes is long enough to cause asphyxiation.
Insofar as it is reasonable to infer intent from such an act, murder is a reasonable charge (assuming one accepts the premise that black lives matter).
Soon thereafter, the New York Times published an op-ed by US Senator Tom Cotton, a staunch Trump ally, who urged the federal government to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and deploy armed forces to suppress public protests.
The paper’s editorial board subsequently repudiated the commentary, blaming its decision to publish it on inadequate fact-checking of Cotton’s spurious characterization of the protesters as anarchists and “nihilist criminals.”
Disseminating misinformation should not be confused with championing “diversity of opinion.”
Those who contend that more speech is the best antidote to fallacious speech are probably right, provided that the matter involves the expression of actual opinions or ideas.
More speech exposed Cotton’s effort to mislead readers, and called into question the Times’ decision to publish it.
But more speech is a futile response to words or images intended merely to foment violence or otherwise disable good-faith efforts at communication.
Disguised and unlabeled political disinformation, visual “deep fakes,” and injurious hoaxes run rampant across Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media platforms every day.
Democracies must be able to defend themselves against the use of words or images that deliberately sow confusion and mistrust in order to disable meaningful public discourse.
The US Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution’s First Amendment protections do not extend to speech acts that threaten imminent violence.
This limit ought to apply whether it’s “fighting words” or signal-jamming words that destroy the essential conditions of communication itself.
All of these recent challenges to democratic governance have a common denominator: bad faith.
An executive order that violates fundamental principles of self-governance is bad faith.
Racist policing is bad faith.
Abandoning the duty of an independent press to speak truth to power is bad faith.
Sowing confusion and distrust by deliberately disseminating disinformation is bad faith.
Politicizing independent agencies is bad faith.
Bad faith on this scale threatens to disable the constitutional mechanisms that exist to check undue concentrations of power within any single branch of government. It also threatens to unravel the broader social compact by subverting the shared democratic values from which the state derives its legitimacy.
When a president calls upon the armed forces to quash dissent, the people – the principal source of the state’s authority – become the state’s enemy.
Likewise, when a president maligns and threatens journalists, the free press – the best guardian “of our every right,” as James Madison described it – becomes, in Trump’s words, “the enemy of the people.”
Finally, when the executive branch uses the Department of Justice to reward political allies (like former Trump advisers Michael T. Flynn and Roger Stone) and to purge perceived foes (like former FBI Director James Comey and US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman), equal justice and the rule of law become the enemy.
And when the political process for appointing federal judges elevates loyalty to the chief executive above fealty to law and a commitment to impartial decision-making, the entire judicial branch loses credibility.
The further this friend/enemy polarization is allowed to go, the deeper the crisis of legitimacy will be. It is essential, therefore, to draw a line against state power exercised in bad faith.
But simply identifying abuses of power is not enough. Defenders of democracy also must ensure that significant collective action will follow if and when the line is crossed.
Mass protest is the last resort of democratic resistance. America’s founders understood this.
That is why “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances” appears among the first guarantees in the US Bill of Rights.
If a republic cannot or simply will not defend itself against brazen acts of bad faith, its days are numbered.
Eternal vigilance may be the price of liberty, but tyranny fails only when a sufficient number of citizens are willing to resist it.
As many have done over the past month, Americans must continue to summon the courage to defend and strengthen the democratic institutions upon which their freedom depends.

The Climate Change Agreement: Bridging Gaps through Science
<d>
Is Gordon Brown Electable?
Gordon Brown obviously wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister.
But it is less obvious that he is willing to do what is necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next general election.
In some critical sense, he must repudiate Blair’s legacy, which, at a minimum, means promising to take Britain out of the Iraq War.
Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12, 1994, the fateful day when John Smith, the Labour Party’s leader in opposition, dropped dead of a heart attack.
Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London, and debated who should take over the party leadership.
By the end of their discussion, they had made a double deal: Brown would stand aside and support Blair as the next party leader; in return, Blair would later give up the leadership to him.
Crucially, but inevitably, they did not agree when, or under what circumstances, Blair would fulfil his side of the bargain.
Inevitably, they could not foresee that Blair would go on to win an unprecedented three successive election victories for Labour, in 1997, 2001, and 2005, and thus keep Labour in power for a record-breaking period of possibly as long as 13 years.
The key challenge for New Labour (as Blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for spin), was the management of the British economy.
Since World War II, most British governments tried to manipulate the economy for short-term party advantage, usually with disastrous long-term results.
This lamentable tradition was common to both Conservatives and Labour; and yet, unfairly, it was the Labour Party that was most contaminated by the smear that it could not be trusted to manage the economy.
Brown decisively changed that reputation.
He has been probably the most outstanding Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history, not because of any inspiration or genius, but simply because he has built on a new tradition of prioritizing low inflation, low interest rates, and stable government finances.
Brown understood that these priorities were essential, not just for the British economy, but also for the long-term prospects of Labour in power; and he entrenched this agenda by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low.
As a result, Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth, outperforming many of its European counterparts.
Yet, despite economic success, it became steadily clearer that Blair’s time was running out.
The electorate grew increasingly disillusioned with the unavoidable shortcomings of an over-familiar government, and the party grew increasingly discontented with a leader who had outstayed his welcome.
At first, Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power for a third full five-year term.
But the pressure on him to go has steadily risen, to the point where he has now almost promised to give up in the summer of 2007.
But no one knows exactly when, or how, Blair will step down.
If there is a formal leadership contest, it seems likely that several rival candidates will aim to stand.
But almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that Brown is by far the most likely man to be the next Labour prime minister.
That is the easy part.
From that point on, no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do, or has what it takes, to fight and win another general election for Labour.
His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged, but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies.
He has remained dour and almost silent, visibly chafing with impatience to come into his inheritance, but offering no hint of what difference he would make when he does.
The one thing he cannot do is promises to continue Blair’s policies.
If Brown offers more of the same, he will lose.
After ten years of Blair, he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear break.
The most obvious candidate for such a policy switch is Iraq: if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader, he must renounce Blair’s policy and announce the withdrawal, in short order, of British troops.
In tactical terms, this should be easy and obvious: whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons originally given for invading Iraq, everyone now knows that this war has proved a political, strategic, and moral catastrophe.
Everyone knows that it cannot be “won,” whatever that means, and Brown knows that both the war and Britain’s servile subordination to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in Britain.
This is the issue that is crying out to be addressed: but so far none of the main political parties has dared touch it.
In the past three weeks, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives have all held their annual conferences.
All of them concentrated on domestic policies; none dared discuss Iraq, because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal, which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain’s relationship with the US.
Does Brown have the stomach to take on the risks involved in confronting the Iraq question?
Possibly not.
He may decide that it is too difficult, in which case he will be a lame duck prime minister, condemned to serve out the three years remaining in Labour’s current term with no hope of winning the next election.
That is not what he planned when he struck his bargain with Blair back in 1994.

CEOs Are the Problem
CAMBRIDGE – ExxonMobil recently announced a five-year plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and is pumping out ads proclaiming its commitment to a green future.
Tobacco giant Philip Morris is touting its plans to help smokers quit.
Facebook is calling for new internet regulations.
And these moves come less than two years after the Business Roundtable, representing the CEOs of America’s largest corporations, issued a statement calling for business to serve all stakeholders.
Are today’s corporate executives ushering in a new era of corporate responsibility?
Or are they merely protecting their own power?
For decades, business leaders and prominent academics believed that corporations’ sole commitment was to their shareholders.
Previously a fringe view, the publication of a New York Times op-ed by Milton Friedman in 1970 – “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” – moved this perspective toward the mainstream.
It gained further momentum within academia following a number of articles by Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen, who offered theoretical and empirical support for Friedman’s doctrine.
For example, in one influential paper, Jensen and Kevin Murphy of the University of Southern California estimated that the average CEO’s pay increased by only $3.25 for every $1,000 of value he created, pointing to the need for an even tighter link between executive compensation and shareholder value.
But this academic research was following more than leading the trend.
By the 1980s, CEOs like General Electric’s Jack Welch and scores of management consulting companies had already normalized the preoccupation with shareholder value.
Corporations started downsizing their workforces, limiting wage growth, and offshoring tasks – all in the name of delivering better value to shareholders.
Although proponents of shareholder primacy would not have approved of the type of fraud that became associated with Enron, WorldCom, and others, it was easy to see how an obsession with increasing the stock price might lead some executives to go too far.
There is now growing agreement that maximizing shareholder value should not be a corporation’s sole aim.
Less obvious, however, is what model should be adopted instead.
Should we draw up a new charter for executives so that they feel empowered to consider a broader set of interests?
The Business Roundtable seems to think so.
But I would caution against any solution that gives even more discretion to management.
The problem with shareholder primacy wasn’t only that it created an obsession with stock prices and pitted workers against shareholders; it was that it handed a massive amount of power to top managers.
Many CEOs now run their companies according to their own personal vision.
There is very little social oversight, and executive compensation has soared.
Despite the unprecedented hardship caused by the pandemic, CEOs of hard-hit companies took home tens of millions of dollars last year.
When inordinately empowered CEOs receive a vague mandate to pursue stakeholder interests as they see fit, abuses are sure to follow.
Some companies might funnel millions of dollars to their CEOs’ pet project (be it the Metropolitan Museum of Art or a preferred charter school program), or to “philanthropic” causes that are really just veiled forms of influence-peddling.
Under the current incentives structure, there is little stopping corporations from collecting huge amounts of consumer data, disempowering workers and citizens, and establishing tyrannical new forms of surveillance – even as they are advertising their philanthropy and virtue.
There is certainly nothing that prevents them from pursuing excessive automation to reduce labor costs, destroying jobs just to eke out a few more bucks for shareholders.
The way to reverse these anti-social trends is through a two-pronged approach that is very different from what the Business Roundtable would prefer.
First, the legal and institutional constraints on top executives need to be strengthened. For too long, managers have avoided criminal prosecution for criminal behavior.
Even the colossal abuses leading to the 2008 financial crisis went almost entirely unpunished.
As journalist Jesse Eisinger points out, today’s executive-friendly legal landscape owes much to ambitious, selfish prosecutors’ tendency to eschew criminal charges against businesses and managers in order to further their own careers.
More importantly, legislation is needed to set clearer red lines.
It should not be left to CEOs to decide whether to engage in aggressive tax avoidance and then pay themselves with the proceeds.
It should not be optional for companies to reduce their carbon footprint.
And we urgently need to redirect technological change by pushing corporations away from incessant automation.
These issues all bear on our prospects for maintaining a functioning society; they must not be left to the goodwill of self-interested CEOs.
The second prong is complementary to the first.
ExxonMobil, Philip Morris, and Facebook are virtue signaling because they are under increasing pressure from civil society, not because their CEOs suddenly have become more public-spirited.
That kind of pressure is needed now to block any reforms that would give executives even more discretion.
But civic activism works better when laws specify what counts as unacceptable corporate behavior, be it tax evasion, excessive automation, pollution, or accounting tricks to enrich shareholders and greedy managers.
There is no reason to believe that ExxonMobil, Philip Morris, and Facebook are committed to overhauling their socially destructive business models.
Their public-relations efforts reflect the pressure they are feeling.
Civic activism is starting to work, and it could become even more effective.
But that will take better organizing and stronger demands on corporations – not whitewashing campaigns designed to defuse criticism and demobilize the critics.
Corporate responsibility is too important to be left to corporate leaders.

After the Guns of August
The Middle East is a place where the dust hardly ever settles.
When it occasionally does, even for a short interval – as UN Resolution 1701 for cessation of hostilities in Lebanon seems to be holding – it is time to take stock of events in the hopes that a responsible debate may influence those in power.
Let’s start with the United States.
President George W. Bush has been short on neither initiatives nor catchy slogans and acronyms.
Recent years are littered with them: “Global War on Terror” (GWOT), “Road Map,” “Middle East Partnership Initiative “ (MEPI), “Broader Middle East and North Africa” (BMENA) – originally “Greater Middle East Initiative (GMEI) – Democracy Assisted Dialogue (DAD), and so on.
His latest reverie, envisioned in the thick of the recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, was the New Middle East (NME), with US clients Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia serving as the pillars of regional order.
But like all his previous initiatives since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington almost five years ago now, the NME ran into trouble from the outset.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced its birth while rejecting an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon.
Her poor timing made the initiative appear heartless, as thousands of civilians were being uprooted, killed, or maimed by Israel’s efficient but ruthless artillery and air force.
This so embarrassed the three Arab NME partners that each raced to distance itself from the US-sponsored initiative.
Saudi Arabia, which had remained silent for nearly two weeks, did so with a $500 million contribution to rebuilding devastated areas of Lebanon and another billion to support Lebanon’s threatened currency.
Egypt’s heir apparent Gamal Mubarak followed suit in the fourth week of the fighting by heading a 70-member delegation on a solidarity visit to Beirut.
But, rather than earning him the respect of an outraged Egyptian public, revelations in the opposition press that his plane had to obtain a safe passage and authority to land from the Israelis garnered only howls of derision.
As for America, anything it touches in the Middle East has become radioactive, even for longstanding clients and friends.
In the course of maneuvering to delay the UN ceasefire, Bush and Rice continually reiterated the need for a Security Council resolution that deals forcefully with “the roots of the problem.”
Of course, for them and for Israel, this was Hezbollah and the need to eradicate or at a minimum disarm it and force its fighters to a safe distance from settlements and towns in northern Israel.
While this is a reasonable demand, the rest of the Middle East – and, indeed, much of the world, including Europe – regard the root cause of the conflict as Israeli intransigence and arrogance, together with America’s blind support for it.
Both America and Israel have cited foot-dragging in implementing UN Resolution 1559, which calls for disarming all non-state actors in Lebanon and the deployment of government forces all the way to the southern border.
But for years the US and Israel have not uttered a word about the dozens of UN resolutions, going back as far as Resolution 49 on partition in 1947, which called for the establishment of distinct Arab and Jewish states on roughly half of Mandated Palestine.
This and numerous other resolutions seeking redress for injustices toward Palestinians have been ignored by the US.
Thus, for 300 million Arabs and more than one billion Muslims the “root cause” of the Middle East conflict is not Hezbollah.
As its leader, Hassan Nasrallah aptly put it, “We are just a reaction to chronic injustice.”
It may well be that there is more than one root cause – every party to the conflict has a favorite one.
There is no point in belaboring whose pain is greater or whose root cause is deeper.
In fact, arguing over grievances merely drives the sides further apart.
The long overdue UN Resolution 1701 may, with its adoption, indicate that all parties are fatigued, or could no longer withstand international pressure.
This is good news for all concerned and provides an opportunity to tackle each party’s “root cause.”
Seizing the opportunity requires that humility rather than moral supremacy prevails.
Empathy, not ethnocentrism, should be the order of the day now that the guns are falling silent and we have rediscovered the limits of military force.
But if we have learned anything at all from the tragic assassinations of the region’s greatest peacemakers, Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin, it is that the guns do not remain silent for long.
During any lull, a fanatic from either side could jump to center stage and, through an act of utter madness, kick up the settling dust and dash the hopes of the many on both sides who still long for a lasting peace.

The IMF Beyond The Crisis
WASHINGTON, DC – When world leaders gather in Pittsburgh for the G-20 summit, they will take stock of the impact of the stimulus measures undertaken so far and discuss how to coordinate an orderly exit from those measures.
They will need to strengthen international guidelines for capital requirements for large multinational banks and address the perverse financial incentives that led to irresponsible risk-taking in the financial sector.
But the most lasting imprint they could leave is to give the International Monetary Fund a broader mandate after this crisis is over.
The IMF’s relevance has greatly increased during the crisis.
It successfully contributed to a coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus, which helped avert a cyclical meltdown.
Its resources have tripled, enabling it to come to the rescue of countries as diverse as Iceland, Pakistan, and Ukraine, which were cut off from international capital markets.
And the Fund has assisted low-income countries with large loans at unprecedented zero interest rates.
The G-20 has shown leadership in providing the political and financial backing for these changes, and the IMF has responded swiftly.
There is, however, a genuine risk that the political momentum will dissipate as the world economy slowly recovers.
It would be a big mistake to let that happen.
This crisis has shown that economic interdependence has grown to such an extent that policy coordination is unavoidable.
The IMF should be given a clear mandate that would give it the political clout to help prevent such crises from recurring.
The G-20 leaders should authorize the IMF to safeguard international financial stability.
All crises of the past two decades had their origin not so much in misguided fiscal and monetary policies, nor in misaligned exchange rates, but rather in the explosive dynamics of financial markets.
A strengthened role in ensuring financial stability would be a logical complement to the existing, but too narrow mandate the IMF has for overseeing the international monetary system.
The two are clearly interlinked.
A stronger financial stability role does not imply that the IMF would itself become a supervisor.
Rather the Fund should build on work done by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the multilateral rule setting body established by the G-20.
This body is comprised of ministers of finance, central bankers, and supervisors from the G-20 countries. The IMF can help monitor whether countries follow up on agreed undertakings in the FSB, and alert leaders to gaps in the regulatory framework and vulnerabilities in the financial system that need to be addressed.
But, for effective fulfillment of such a strengthened mandate, the IMF needs strong political backing that countries will follow up on its own advice as well.
This has been lacking in the past, as the IMF had insufficient instruments to enforce policy action.
Moreover, G-20 leaders should express their commitment to future policy coordination by, for example, organizing a peer-review process in which ministers would hold each other accountable for their economic and financial-sector policies.
The IMF would contribute to this process with analysis, focusing on economic interdependencies and spillovers from one economy to another.
Such surveillance can build on the findings of the early-warning exercise, which the IMF has initiated, together with the FSB.
This exercise alerts ministers on low-risk but high-impact events and advises them on appropriate courses of action.
The IMF can monitor the follow-up that countries give to policy advice following from these exercises.
Global financial stability must be secured by a better functioning international monetary system.
The IMF should analyze how to move in an orderly way from a dollar-based system to a multipolar system.
The Special Drawing Right, the IMF-issued reserve currency based on a basket comprising the dollar, euro, yen, and pound sterling, may play a useful role here.
(The yuan should be included as soon as China makes its currency convertible.)
A multipolar system may help better address global imbalances than the current dollar-based system, which simply perpetuates large imbalances as countries pile up large dollar reserves.
The need for such build-up would lessen if the IMF develops into an insurance-type of institution that has SDR credit lines readily available.
Today’s political momentum should be used to carve out a strong role for the IMF beyond the crisis.
International policy coordination, which has been effective in averting a financial meltdown, should continue after the crisis, preferably in the form of a peer-review process in the G-20 underpinned by IMF analysis.
But continued political support for the IMF needs to be based on fairness in the institution itself.
Quotas and influence in the international financial institutions should be based on countries’ economic weight and the ability to contribute financially.
Therefore, the upcoming quota review will have to give a greater weight to countries that are currently underrepresented, particular the world’s dynamic emerging economies.

Arab States of Uncertainty
MADRID – The revolutions that swept the Arab world during the last two years have exposed the extraordinary fragility of key Arab states.
With the exception of historical countries such as Egypt or Morocco, most Arab states are artificial constructs of European colonialism, which combined disparate tribes and ethnicities into unitary states that could be held together only by authoritarian rule and a common enemy – Zionism and its Western patrons.
Today’s turmoil, however, is no longer driven by anger at foreign forces; instead, it marks a second phase of the de-colonization process: the assertion of the right of self-determination by peoples and tribes united only by a dictator’s yoke.
Indeed, it is not entirely farfetched to anticipate the emergence of new Arab states from the debris of the old, artificial ones.
The American invasion of Iraq set the pattern, for it broke the central government’s power and empowered ethnic and religious enclaves.
What happened in Yugoslavia, an ill-conceived product of Wilsonian diplomacy, could happen in the more cynical imperial creations in the Middle East.
What Sigmund Freud defined as “the narcissism of minor differences” caused Yugoslavia to split into seven small states (including Kosovo), following the bloodiest fighting in Europe since World War II.
Can the Arab states avoid a similar fate?
Democratization in the Arab world is not only about toppling dictators; it is also about redressing the politico-ethnic map of the region, which has kept too many minority groups dissatisfied. Consider the Kurds, who were split among Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran.
But the Kurds are hardly alone.
Libya was created out of three former Italian colonies, Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Fezzan, each essentially comprising different tribal confederations (the Sa’adi in Cyrenaica, the Saff al-Bahar in Tripolitania, and the Tuareg in Fezzan).
The fall of Muammar el-Qaddafi opened a Pandora’s box of old rivalries, with Cyrenaica developing into a semi-autonomous region known as Barqa.
Likewise, long-standing tensions between Bahrain’s ruling Sunni minority and Shia majority have worsened since the country’s Shia-led pro-democracy movement was crushed in 2011.
As for Jordan, the precarious balance between the Palestinian majority and the Bedouin minority was difficult enough to maintain in stable times; it is a far more precarious undertaking now.
Other states in the region have been teetering on the brink of failure from the outset.
Yemen emerged in 1990 from the reunification of South Yemen and North Yemen, which fought bitter wars in 1972 and 1979.
But its leaders have never been able to integrate the tribes, the primary units of Yemen’s social structure, into the political system in a manner that generates their unequivocal acceptance of the sovereign state.
Syria powerfully demonstrates how a fight against a dictator can soon turn into a sectarian struggle for survival or mastery.
Notwithstanding the worldwide legitimacy now enjoyed by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, a disorderly collapse of the regime might yet lead to the country’s division into autonomous ethnic enclaves.
The rebels, mostly Sunnis assisted by jihadi groups such as the Nusra Front, an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq, have never truly attempted to reach out to the country’s minorities – Christians, Shia, Druze, and Kurds – which have repudiated the National Coalition as being “obedient to Turkey and Qatar.”
The Kurds, under the yoke of Arabs, Turks, and Iranians, saw in the demise of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq – and now see in the dismemberment of other Arab autocracies – an opportunity to join the new Great Middle Eastern Game.
That means realizing the dream of uniting their dispersed nation in an independent Kurdish state.
The Kurdish militias in northern Syria, which sought to stay out of the civil war while preparing their own autonomous enclave should Bashar al-Assad’s regime be toppled, are now being drawn into the fighting; the Iraqi Kurds, who have been training their Syrian kin, may well follow.
Turkey inevitably views Kurdish activism in northern Syria – led by the Democratic Union party, an offshoot of the insurgent Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey – as a direct threat to its stability, and will do its utmost to prevent it from sparking rebellion among Turkey’s own restive Kurdish minority.
Lebanon is yet another ethnic tapestry that cannot be immune to events in Syria.
Already, signs of spillover effects can be seen in clashes between Sunni and Alawite militias.
However hegemonic Hezbollah may now seem, its power in Lebanon depends heavily on the support of the Assad regime.
Should Assad fall, and the Sunni-led opposition rise to power, the ensuing balance of power in Syria is bound to reshape the balance of power in Lebanon.
Might South Sudan, the mostly Christian state that seceded in 2011 from the Muslim Arab North after a long civil war, become the new paradigm for non-historical Arab states riven by ethnic and tribal rivalries?
As former Prime Minister of China Zhou Enlai supposedly said of the impact of the French Revolution, “It is too early to tell.”
But there can be no doubt that the post-colonial status quo in the Middle East is crumbling.
A multifaceted region has yet to crystallize into more definitive political constructions.

America and China’s Codependency Trap
NEW HAVEN – Seemingly at odds with the world, US President Donald Trump has once again raised the possibility of a trade conflict with China.
On August 14, he instructed the US Trade Representative to commence investigating Chinese infringement of intellectual property rights.
By framing this effort under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, the Trump administration could impose high and widespread tariffs on Chinese imports.
This is hardly an inconsequential development.
While there may well be merit to the allegations, as documented in the latest “USTR Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance,” punitive action would have serious consequences for US businesses and consumers.
Like it or not, that is an inevitable result of the deeply entrenched codependent relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
In a codependent human relationship, when one party alters the terms of engagement, the other feels scorned and invariably responds in kind.
The same can be expected of economies and their leaders.
That means in a trade conflict, it is important to think about reciprocity – specifically, China’s response to an American action.
In fact, that was precisely the point made by China’s Ministry of Commerce in its official response to Trump’s gambit.
China, the ministry vowed, would “take all appropriate measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights.”
Caught up in the bluster of the US accusations being leveled at China, little attention is being paid to the potential consequences of Chinese retaliation.
Three economic consequences stand out.
First, imposing tariffs on imports of Chinese goods and services would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on American consumers.
Chinese producers’ unit labor costs are less than one fifth those of America’s other major foreign suppliers.
By diverting US demand away from Chinese trade, the costs of imported goods would undoubtedly rise sharply.
The possibility of higher import prices and potential spillover effects on underlying inflation would hit middle-class US workers, who have faced more than three decades of real wage stagnation, especially hard.
Second, trade actions against China could lead to higher US interest rates.
Foreigners currently own about 30% of all US Treasury securities, with the latest official data putting Chinese ownership at $1.15 trillion in June 2017 – fully 19% of total foreign holdings and slightly higher than Japan’s $1.09 trillion.
In the event of new US tariffs, it seems reasonable to expect China to respond by reducing such purchases, reinforcing a strategy of asset diversification away from US dollar-based assets that has been under way for the past three years.
In an era of still-large US budget deficits – likely to go even higher in the aftermath of Trump administration tax cuts and spending initiatives – the lack of demand for Treasuries by the largest foreign owner could well put upward pressure on borrowing costs.
Third, with growth in US domestic demand still depressed, American companies need to rely more on external demand.
Yet the Trump administration seems all but oblivious to this component of the growth calculus.
It is threatening trade sanctions not only against China – America’s third-largest and fastest-growing major export market – but also against NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico (America’s largest and second-largest export markets, respectively).
As the reactive pathology of codependency would suggest, none of these countries can be expected to acquiesce to such measures without curtailing US access to their markets – a counter-response that could severely undermine the manufacturing revival that seems so central to the Trump presidency’s promise to “Make America Great Again.”
In the end, China’s economic leverage over America is largely the result of low US domestic saving.
In the first quarter of 2017, the so-called net national saving rate – the combined depreciation-adjusted saving of businesses, households, and the government sector – stood at just 1.9% of national income, well below the longer-term average of 6.3% that prevailed over the final three decades of the twentieth century.
Lacking in saving and wanting to consume and grow, the US must import surplus saving from abroad to close the gap, forcing it to run massive current-account and trade deficits with countries like China to attract the foreign capital.
It is sheer political chicanery to single out China, America’s NAFTA partners, or even Germany as the culprit in a saving-short US economy.
Fostering policies that encourage an economy to squander its saving and live beyond its means makes trade deficits a given – as are the seemingly unfair trading practices that may come with this Faustian bargain for foreign capital.
The US ran trade deficits with 101 countries in 2016 – a multilateral external imbalance rooted in America’s chronic domestic saving problem.
The fix for this problem cannot be made in China.
Ironically, with the Trump administration’s policies likely to lead to larger budget deficits that put national saving under additional downward pressure, the need for Chinese and other foreign capital will actually intensify and the codependency trap will only close more tightly.
America does not hold the trump card in its economic relationship with China.
The Trump administration can certainly put pressure on China, and, on one level, there may well be good reason to do so.
But deep questions concerning the consequences of such pressure have been all but ignored.
Getting tough on China while ignoring those consequences could be a blunder of epic proportions.

Averting Debt Disaster in the Developing World
BEIJING – Many developing countries are teetering on the edge of a debt crisis, with the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring food and energy costs, and the monetary tightening of major economies all threatening to push them over.
But the international community has yet to do what is necessary to pull at-risk countries back from the brink.
For some economies, such as Lebanon and Sri Lanka, the crisis has already arrived.
They could soon be joined by many more.
As of the end of March, 38 of 69 low-income countries were either already in or at high risk of debt distress.
Middle-income developing countries’ debt-service burden is at its highest level in 30 years.
The international community has taken some action in response to the problem.
Soon after the pandemic began, the G20 introduced the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), under which $12.9 billion in payments owed by 73 low-income countries was suspended between May 2020 and December 2021.
Moreover, in November 2020, the G20, together with the Paris Club of sovereign creditors, created the Common Framework for Debt Treatments Beyond the DSSI to help DSSI countries restructure their debt and manage insolvency and protracted liquidity problems.
But these initiatives are nowhere near enough to resolve developing economies’ debt problems.
One problem is stigma: When a debtor resorts to the Common Framework, it can face a sovereign credit downgrade.
Most countries are not willing to take that risk, especially given the initiative’s limited scope.
Moreover, although the Common Framework relies mainly on support from official creditors, it is private creditors who own the majority (60%) of the claims.
The perception that private creditors are freeriding could discourage official creditors from accepting more debtor-friendly terms.
And debtor countries know that, even if they undergo a Common Framework restructuring, they will still have their burdens of private debt to deal with.
It is little wonder that only three debtor countries have so far applied to restructure their debt under the Common Framework.
There is a better way.
In August 2021, the International Monetary Fund approved a general allocation of $650 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs, the IMF’s reserve asset), which was distributed to member countries in proportion to their quota shares.
If used wisely, these funds can go a long way toward supporting indebted countries.
The obvious proposal would be for countries with idle SDRs simply to donate them to struggling countries. But, beyond the risk of moral hazard, this approach is unlikely to produce enough funds to make much difference.
After all, loan commitments to the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) totaled just $7.8 billion in 2021.
That is better than nothing, but still far from adequate.
To make a real difference, SDRs must be used more imaginatively.
Developing economies suffer from the so-called original sin problem, meaning that they cannot borrow abroad in their own currency.
Moreover, they often struggle to borrow in international bond markets, owing to weak sovereign credit ratings.
But if SDRs were used to boost their credit ratings, private investment could be leveraged to tackle high debts.
The first step would be for the IMF to borrow interest-free SDRs from member countries, and put them into a trust – whether the PRGT, the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, or a new entity.
Next, debtor and creditor countries would jointly apply for SDR loans from the trust, or a debtor country would apply alone before negotiating terms with its creditors.
Either way, the application process would be open, transparent, and market-based.
The IMF could work with creditor and debtor countries to establish a reporting mechanism that covers all debt claims and relevant data.
Participants would cooperate to ensure that the debt restructuring followed best practices and met transparency standards.
Once the application was approved, the IMF trust would extend a concessional SDR loan to the debtor country, with a very low – even zero – interest rate.
Since the SDR is neither a currency nor a claim on the Fund, borrowers would then convert the funds into one of the asset’s five constituent currencies – the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, or the British pound – which would be used to purchase high-rated government bonds issued by reserve-currency countries.
With these risk-free assets as collateral, debtor countries could then issue “international anti-epidemic cooperation bonds,” using the proceeds to roll over or repay debt.
Such a credit-enhancement program – which is consistent with the Common Framework – would ease liquidity pressures and reduce debt risks while avoiding moral hazard.
More important, it would spur the private sector to participate actively in the debt-restructuring process and boost the resources being channeled toward development financing.
Despite fees and commissions, we estimate that this program could save a typical debtor country 30-50% in interest costs, compared to a bond issuance without collateral.
Our proposed program could also be adapted to advance other imperatives, such as creating innovative financing instruments for supporting sustainable development and investment in green infrastructure.
In addition to the IMF, the World Bank and regional developments banks, such as the African Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, could participate in such initiatives.
Pressure on the developing world is not set to ease any time soon. But an SDR-backed credit-enhancement program could spare it from another debt crisis.

Will David Malpass Trump the World Bank?
LONDON – David Malpass has taken over as World Bank president, and he carries some heavy political baggage.
He is, after all, the pick of US President Donald Trump, raising fears that he may use the position to open a new front in Trump’s trade war with China, weaken the Bank’s leadership on climate change, and undercut multilateralism more broadly.
At this week’s International Monetary Fund-World Bank Spring Meetings, Malpass needs to address these concerns head-on.
He should be judged not by his past, or by his links to the Trump administration, but by his delivery.
As leader of a 189-member multilateral institution with a remit to tackle some of the greatest injustices of our time, from poverty to extreme inequality and global warming, Malpass is stepping into one of the world’s most important jobs.
Whatever the circumstances of his appointment, the temptation to pass sentence on Malpass ahead of a fair trial should be avoided.
His anti-multilateral instincts can be overstated.
As a senior US Treasury Department official, he helped engineer a $13-billion capital increase for the World Bank last year.
He has also signaled an intent to keep poverty reduction at the heart of the Bank’s mission.
The Spring Meetings provide an opportunity to put words into action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the international community’s 2030 targets for eradicating poverty, improving health and wellbeing, expanding opportunity, and environmental sustainability.
Despite the extraordinary progress of the past two decades, the SDG warning signs are flashing.
Recent World Bank estimates point to a sharp slowdown in the pace of global poverty reduction.
On current trends, some 600 million people will remain below the official poverty line of $1.90 per day in 2030.
Over 40% of those people will be African children.
Child survival data are similarly worrying.
While the death rate of children under the age of five has been nearly halved since 2000, the SDG target of zero preventable child deaths is drifting out of reach.
On current trends, more than three million children under five will die in 2030.
The report card on education is similarly bleak.
In our increasingly knowledge-based global economy, there are still some 263 million young people out of school.
One-quarter of these young people are primary-school-age children – and the numbers are rising.
An even greater number of children are in school, but not receiving a quality education.
For these children, the SDG commitment to “expand opportunity” has all the hallmarks of a bounced check.
Inequality lies at the heart of the looming shortfall regarding the 2030 targets.
Without some hefty income redistribution in favor of the poor, there is no prospect that the poverty eradication goal will be achieved.
The same applies to child survival.
Children born into the poorest 20% of households account for one-third of all child deaths, largely because of poor nutrition and inadequate and unequal access to health care (including vaccinations).
Cutting the gap in death rates will require the redirection of health budgets toward the most deprived and marginalized children.
These are areas in which the World Bank and its new president can make a difference.
To its credit, the Bank has increasingly turned the spotlight on inequality.
But it has been curiously reticent about advocating for the redistributive policies in taxation, public spending, and regulation needed to narrow social disparities.
Malpass may not be an obvious champion for pro-poor redistribution, but that is what is needed.
There is legitimate cause for concern on this front.
In his initial “election” manifesto, Malpass focused overwhelmingly on cutting taxes, while scrupulously avoiding any reference to the need for increased public spending in areas like health, education, and infrastructure.
This is a cure guaranteed to kill the SDG patient.
Far from cutting taxes, the IMF estimates that developing countries will need to raise an additional 5% of GDP in tax revenues to achieve the SDGs.
The World Bank should be helping build the progressive and accountable tax systems needed to achieve this outcome.
At a time of shrinking aid budgets, the Bank should also be supporting more innovative approaches to finance.
Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the United Nations Special Envoy for Education, has called for the creation of an International Finance Facility for Education that would use loan guarantees to unlock $8 billion in new education financing for lower-middle-income countries, whose access to concessional finance is currently restricted.
This would help put 70 million children in school.
Health financing is another high-priority area.
Millions of children die each year as a result of treatable diseases like pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea, because their parents cannot afford health fees, or because clinics lack trained health workers, drugs, and vital diagnostic equipment.
Under its former president, Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank championed publicly financed universal health coverage, and for good reason: there is no alternative route to providing quality health services to the poor.
Malpass should work closely with the WHO to drive this agenda, focusing on primary care services.
Of course, progress on the SDGs is not just about spending more. It is also about spending more equitably.
In a new report to be launched at the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings, Save the Children documents a glaring gap between health risks, which are heavily skewed toward the poorest children, and the benefits of public spending, are often skewed in favor of better-off households.
This flies in the face of a central pledge governments made when they signed on to the SDGs: that those countries furthest from the targets would benefit from the fastest progress.
In the language of the agenda, “no one should be left behind.”
The World Bank could help improve accountability for fulfilling that commitment by working with the UN and national agencies to monitor and report on the pace at which disparities in key indicators, from mortality to education, are being narrowed.
Both the World Bank and the IMF should also use their public-finance reporting to monitor whether fiscal policies are aligned with the pledge to narrow social inequalities.
Malpass has the unique privilege and responsibility of overseeing one of the world’s largest sources of development finance – an institution staffed by dedicated professionals committed to transforming millions of lives by achieving the SDG targets.
He must not drop the ball.

The Snowden Effect
MADRID – The continued leaking of classified information by the former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has provoked heated debate about privacy and international law, which, unfortunately, has overshadowed the geostrategic dimension of his actions.
In fact, Snowden’s revelations about US surveillance programs, and his own ongoing struggle to avoid extradition, reveal much about President Barack Obama’s conception of US foreign relations.
More than any other incoming American president in recent memory, Obama raised expectations worldwide.
Yet he has proved to be mainly, if not solely, interested in domestic issues, resulting in a foreign policy of reaction.
The Snowden affair highlights three elements of this: US-Russia relations, US influence in South America, and US relations with Europe.
The Kremlin’s handling of the affair is indicative of the tense state of US-Russia relations.
In the aftermath of the bilateral relationship’s ill-fated “reset,” Russia has been eager to maintain its global position as a foil to the US, causing many people on both sides to revert to a Cold War mentality.
By falling into this trap, the US has provided President Vladimir Putin with endless fodder to score political points and solidify his domestic position.
Putin regards anti-Americanism as an effective tool for short-circuiting domestic discontent.
Developments like the US Congress’s enactment of the Magnitsky Act, portrayed in Russia as an American provocation, have allowed the Kremlin to rally support at home with retaliatory measures such as a ban on foreign adoptions, while providing cover for a crackdown on domestic opponents.
Following the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011, which the Kremlin regarded as another example of Western overreach, Russia has been more aggressive in asserting itself internationally, mainly in opposition to the US.
This is most obvious in Russia’s dogged support for Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria.
And Russia’s refusal to hand over Snowden, under the pretext of strict adherence to the law, has allowed Putin to poke Obama in the eye once again – this time while posing as a defender of legality and human rights.
This coup de théȃtre was magnified by Putin’s cynical claim that Russia would allow Snowden to stay only if he stopped leaking information “aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners.”
Presumably, Putin would not object to the infliction of such damage behind closed doors, during a debriefing with the Russian security services.
Moreover, the Snowden affair reinforces the perception that the US is losing its sway in South America.
With few notable exceptions, such as US Ambassador to Brazil Tom Shannon, US diplomacy has lacked a strategic vision for Latin America.
Barack Obama’s 2008 election created high expectations in this region, too; but his administration’s approach has been reserved, at best, and often obtuse.
While China’s influence in Latin America has soared, the US has remained aloof.
Obama’s visit in May was presented as an effort to reinvigorate relations in the context of the rise of the Asia-Pacific region.
Unfortunately, the chickens of Obama’s first term have already come home to roost.
For example, the US is far and away Ecuador’s largest trading partner, accounting for more than a third of its foreign trade.
Yet, facing the possibility that Ecuador might grant Snowden asylum, the US felt the need to scramble, with Vice President Joe Biden personally pleading America’s case to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, even after Obama announced that he would not engage in “wheeling and dealing” over the extradition.
The threat by US officials to cut off aid to Ecuador, which would amount to a measly $12 million in 2014, further evinces a clumsy approach.
America’s traditional sources of influence – its soft power, regional alliances, and financial leverage – appear to be running dry.
The message to the world is clear: the US is not the regional power that it should be.
Finally, turning to Europe, Obama’s flippant attitude concerning alleged US surveillance of the European Union and its member states shows that American exceptionalism is alive and well.
Instead of acknowledging the legitimacy of European concerns, he shrugged them off as a frivolity: “[I] guarantee you that in European capitals, there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders.”
The US certainly has an interest in gaining deeper analytical insight into its European allies’ decision-making than can be gained by simply calling, say, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Accepting that spying is realistically part of the US toolkit, we Europeans expect it to be conducted responsibly.
By dismissing European concerns about how such surveillance is carried out, Obama has demonstrated one of America’s worst habits – that of patronizing Europe.
In fact, Europeans have raised serious questions about US intelligence practices. These range from the lack of professionalism implied by allowing contractors to conduct such sensitive work to America’s hands-off approach toward certain allies, like the United Kingdom and New Zealand, while relegating many of its other allies – including most of the European Union – to surveillance-worthy status.
The bitter irony is that, at this suddenly inauspicious moment, Europe and the US are launching their most significant joint project since the creation of NATO – a transatlantic free-trade agreement.
For the sake of its success, is it really too much to ask of the US that it play its part internationally with a bit more skill and professionalism, and that it treat its partners with respect?

No to Academic Normalization of Trump
CAMBRIDGE – The University of Virginia recently faced a storm of protest after its Miller Center of Public Affairs appointed President Donald Trump’s former Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short, to a one-year position as Senior Fellow.
Two faculty members severed ties with the center, and a petition to reverse the decision has gathered nearly 4,000 signatures.
A similar protest erupted at my home institution last year, when Corey Lewandowski, a one-time campaign manager for Trump, was appointed a fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
The Trump administration confronts universities with a serious dilemma.
On one hand, universities must be open to diverse viewpoints, including those that conflict with mainstream opinion or may seem threatening to specific groups.
Students and faculty who share Trump’s viewpoint should be free to speak without censorship.
Universities must remain fora for free inquiry and debate.
Moreover, schools and institutes of public affairs must offer student and faculty opportunities to engage with the policymakers of the day.
On the other hand, there is the danger of normalizing and legitimizing what can only be described as an odious presidency.
Trump violates on a daily basis the norms on which liberal democracy rests.
He undermines freedom of the media and independence of the judiciary, upholds racism and sectarianism, and promotes prejudice.
He blithely utters one falsehood after another.
Those who serve with him are necessarily tainted by the experience.
Trump’s close associates and political appointees are his enablers – regardless of their personal merits and how much they try to disassociate themselves from Trump’s utterances.
Qualities like “intelligence,” “effectiveness,” “integrity,” and “collegiality” – words used by Miller Center Director William J. Antholis to justify Short’s appointment – have little to commend them when they are deployed to advance an illiberal political agenda.
The stain extends beyond political operatives and covers economic policymakers as well.
Trump’s cabinet members and high-level appointees share collective responsibility for propping up a shameful presidency.
They deserve opprobrium not merely because they hold cranky views on, say, the trade deficit or economic relations with China, but also, and more importantly, because their continued service makes them fully complicit in Trump’s behavior.
Academic institutions must therefore tread a narrow path.
They cannot turn their backs on Trump and his entourage, nor ignore their views. Otherwise, they would be stifling debate.
This would run counter to what universities stand for. As a pragmatic matter, it would also backfire, by giving the Trump camp another opportunity to demonize the “liberal elite.”
But clear rules of engagement are necessary.
The most important principle to uphold is the distinction between hearing someone and honoring someone.
Trump’s immediate circle and senior appointees should be welcome for discussion and debate. They should be treated in a civil manner when they show up.
But they should not be accorded the degree of respect or deference that their seniority and government positions would normally merit.
We do not, after all, have a normal administration that can be served honorably.
This means no honorific titles (fellow, senior fellow), no named lectures, no keynote speeches headlining conferences or events.
While individual faculty members and student groups should be free to invite Trump appointees to speak on campus, as a rule such invitations should not be issued by senior university officers.
And lectures and presentations should always provide an opportunity for vigorous questioning and debate.
Without two-way interaction, there is no learning or understanding; there is only preaching.
Administration officials who simply want to make a statement and escape searching interrogation should not be welcome.
Students and faculty who sympathize with Trump may perceive such practices as discriminatory.
But there is no conflict between encouraging free speech and exchange of views, which these rules are meant to support, and the university making its own values clear.
Like other organizations, universities have the right to determine their practices in accordance with their values.
These practices may diverge from what specific subgroups within them would like to see, either because there are contending values or because there are differences on the practicalities of how to realize them.
For example, some students may believe that requirements for a certain course of study are too stringent or that examinations are a waste of time.
Universities allow free debate about such matters. But they reserve the right to set the rules on concentration requirements and exams.
In doing so, they send an important signal to the rest of society about their teaching philosophy and pedagogical values.
Allowing full debate of Trumpism while refusing to honor it would be no different.
Universities should uphold both free inquiry and the values of liberal democracy.
The first calls for unhindered exchange and interaction with Trumpist views.
The second requires that the engagement be carefully calibrated, with not even a semblance of honor or recognition bestowed on those serving an administration that so grossly violates liberal democratic norms.

Venezuela’s Spectacular Underperformance
CAMBRIDGE – If it were not such an affront to the freedom of expression, we would almost be amused by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s recent tantrum over a commentary by economists Ricardo Hausmann and Miguel Angel Santos.
Venezuela has long lashed out at the International Monetary Fund for daring to suggest that its macroeconomic policies might not be working well. Now its president is lashing out at academics.
Maduro, of course, rules over a major oil-exporting economy that is so badly mismanaged that real (inflation-adjusted) per capita GDP today is 2% lower than it was in 1970, despite a ten-fold increase in oil prices.
Hausmann and Santos had the temerity to ask whether, having defaulting on every conceivable kind of domestic debt, Venezuela should invite foreign investors to the party and default on its debt to them as well.
Is it such an unreasonable question?
It is unclear whether Maduro, who called for Venezuela’s authorities to take unspecified “action” against Hausmann and Santos (both Venezuelan citizens), was more offended by the suggestion that his government should default on external debt, or by the authors’ list of all the other ways it has already defaulted.
These include the government’s $3.5 billion unpaid bill for pharmaceutical imports, payment arrears of more than $2 billion for food, and nearly $4 billion owed to airline companies.
Oil production has more than halved since 1997, in no small part because the state-owned oil company has repeatedly defaulted on suppliers and joint-venture partners.
Both the scope and magnitude of domestic default are enormous, with significant de facto “haircuts” (that is, expropriation) for creditors.
During 2013-2014, yields on domestic government debt were around 17%, while inflation oscillated in the 55-75% range.
Negative ex post real interest rates in the vicinity of 30-60% register on the high end of historical haircuts.
The toll of this “taxation” is not confined to bondholders: pensioners, depositors, and anyone else with claims against the government – or who holds a bolívar – is affected.
So, as Hausmann and Santos ask, should Venezuela’s government default on its foreign debt, given that the historical record shows that nearly all domestic defaults go hand in hand with external default?
Indeed, given that the government is defaulting in numerous ways on its domestic residents already, the historical cross-country probability of an external default is close to one.
Important moral and equity considerations aside, this probability highlights why Hausmann and Santos pose such an obvious question.
In our book This Time Is Different, we document how domestic defaults are associated with deeper and longer-lasting recessions and much higher inflation than “purely” external defaults.
Though we proceed to observe that historically there have been many external defaults without domestic defaults, the converse is not true: nearly all domestic defaults are “twin defaults” that also involve external creditors.
Will the Venezuelan case be different?
Hausmann and Santos are right that the huge extent of domestic default suggests a high risk of external default.
They are also probably right that, for most Venezuelans, external default would be a good thing.
Default on foreign creditors, as we have noted in the past, is a risky strategy that needs to be compared to other options.
But let’s not pretend that such a step is unprecedented in Venezuela’s history.
Since Venezuela became independent, defaults on its bonded external debt have occurred in 1826, 1848, 1860, 1865, 1892, 1898, 1983, 1990, 1995, and 2004.
“That is why,” as Hausmann and Santos point out, “Venezuelan bonds pay over 11 percentage points more than US Treasuries, which is 12 times more than Mexico, four times more than Nigeria, and double what Bolivia pays.”
To attack them for daring to impugn Venezuela’s credit status in 2014 seems a bit out of touch with past and present realities.
The relevant reality now is the long-term plight and dwindling standard of living of the average Venezuelan citizen.
Over the past 45 years, as Venezuela’s real per capita GDP fell, US per capita GDP roughly doubled and Chile’s per capita GDP nearly tripled.
And neutral observers project that 2014 will be even worse for Venezuela – not surprising, given the chaos of the country’s policy fundamentals.
Maduro’s absurd threat against Hausmann and Santos smacks of a search for a scapegoat.
They were not giving a political speech, but were simply summarizing deeply troubling and unpleasant facts.
Given the depth and breadth of the deepening crisis that Venezuela is facing, Maduro’s efforts and attention would be best directed at resolving the country’s problems, rather than at lashing out against scholars stating uncomfortable truths.

A Belt and Road for the Americas?
WASHINGTON, DC – As Canada, Mexico, and the United States focus on the next round of negotiations on modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement – a highly uncertain endeavor – governments in the rest of the Americas are grappling with a more fundamental question about trade. Who will be their dominant trade partner in the future: the US, Europe, or China?
For more than a century, the resounding answer to that question has been, “the US.”
The country’s proximity, soft power, and sheer economic might made it the natural center of commercial attention for Latin America.
And Latin America is the first or second most important trading partner for 37 of the 50 US states.
In 2016, US companies exported a total of $515 billion worth of goods and services to Latin America and the Caribbean – nearly three times as much as they exported to China.
Moreover, whereas the US has a large and recurring trade deficit with China, the country typically posts a surplus with its southern neighbors, which traditionally favor the high-value goods and sophisticated services that US companies provide.
Yet this picture is changing fast.
Over the last two decades, Chinese companies have been quietly gaining market share in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The share of US imports in Latin America dropped from 50% in 2000 to 33% in 2016, while China’s share jumped from 3% to 18%.
In many Latin American homes, Chinese-made laptops, smartphones, televisions, and automobiles have replaced legendary US brands.
Of course, this shift is partly a result of the secular factors that have driven China’s rapid growth and global expansion.
But it also reflects China’s long-term strategy to cement its position in one of the world’s most attractive emerging markets.
By 2030, Latin America and the Caribbean will have a combined population of around 720 million people.
According to conservative forecasts, its GDP will amount to around $9 trillion, with just six economies – Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Peru –accounting for 86% of that total.
Moreover, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are moving toward becoming an integrated bloc.
Thanks to a host of agreements, fully 80% of trade among Latin American and Caribbean countries is already tariff-free.
Various trade-facilitation measures, from paperless customs procedures to the harmonization of rules of origin, are steadily dismantling remaining barriers.
The two largest regional blocs – Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance, both of which include the region’s six largest economies – are taking seriously the possibility of convergence.
This trend toward greater regional integration will offer a unique opportunity to tap an entire highly lucrative market from a few beachheads.
Chinese companies that are now making acquisitions and building factories in Brazil, for example, will be able to distribute their products on preferential terms in neighboring countries, while harnessing regional value chains for parts and raw materials.
Like China, the European Union recognizes Latin America’s vast potential as a trading partner.
To be sure, the EU’s share of total Latin American imports has been declining, and now stands at 13.5%. But it is working hard to reverse this trend, including by completing agreements that cover nearly all of the region’s economies.
And negotiations on a free-trade agreement with the Mercosur countries are in the final stages.
This will put Europe ahead of both China and the US in terms of market access.
But China continues to work hard on many fronts to cement an advantageous position in Latin America, including by pouring large volumes of direct investment into the region.
By some estimates, it has plowed more than $106 billion into Latin America in recent years, including $60 billion in Brazil alone.
Chinese investment has so far gone primarily to agriculture, energy, and mining projects.
But a growing share is now being channeled to manufacturing in sectors that generate higher-wage jobs and transfer much-needed skills to host economies.
In addition, China has become a major underwriter of the new infrastructure that Latin America urgently needs.
It is framing these investments within the narrative of its Belt and Road Initiative, a global vision for connectivity, cooperation, and prosperity that resonates powerfully with Latin American leaders.
As China and the EU seize opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean, the US continues to cede market share. Yet this is its neighborhood, and it could easily propose a similar integration initiative here.
And the US certainly has strong incentive to pursue a strategy of active re-engagement with Latin America: the Inter-American Development Bank calculates that if the US were to reclaim the share of Latin American imports that it had in 2000, it could be exporting around $788 billion each year to the region.
That is enough to support around one million additional US jobs.
Such a strategy could harness the goodwill and enterprise of the 57 million US citizens who have roots south of the Rio Grande, including the 3.3 million US Hispanic-owned firms, many of which are eager to expand overseas.
It might even help to steer the bitter debates over migration and trafficking of drugs and firearms in a more productive direction.
In a time of global uncertainty, a vision of “made in the Americas” prosperity provides a unifying agenda for the continent.
If implemented, the US could reassert its historical leadership among a group of countries that share its fundamental values, as well as an interest in inclusive economic growth and rising living standards.

The Rise of the Food Barons
BERLIN – The industrial-agriculture sector has long faced criticism for practices that contribute to climate change, environmental destruction, and rural poverty.
And yet the sector has taken virtually no steps to improve quality and sustainability, or to promote social justice.
This is not surprising.
Although there are more than 570 million farmers and seven billion consumers worldwide, just a handful of companies control the global industrial-agriculture value chain – from field to shop counter. Given the high profits and vast political power of these companies, changes to the status quo are not in their interest.
Moreover, market concentration in the agriculture sector is on the rise, owing to increased demand for the agricultural raw materials needed in food, animal feed, and energy production.
As the middle class in southern countries has grown, its members’ consumption and nutritional habits have changed, boosting global demand for processed foods – and setting off a scramble for market power among multinational agricultural, chemical, and food corporations.
The biggest players in these sectors have been buying out their smaller competitors for years. But now they are also buying out one another, often with financing provided by investors from completely different sectors.
Consider the seed and agrochemical sector, where Bayer, the second-largest pesticide producer in the world, is in the process of acquiring Monsanto, the largest seed producer, for €66 billion ($74 billion).
If the United States and the European Union approve the deal, as seems likely, just three conglomerates – Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont and ChemChina-Syngenta – will control over 60% of the global seed and agrochemical market.
“Baysanto” alone would be the proprietor of almost every genetically modified plant on the planet.
With other large mergers also being announced, the global agriculture market at the end of 2017 could look very different than it did at the beginning.
Each of the three major conglomerates will be closer to its goal of achieving domination of the seed and pesticide markets – at which point they will be able to dictate food products, prices, and quality worldwide.
The agrotechnical sector is experiencing some of the same changes as the seed sector.
The five largest corporations account for 65% of the market, with Deere & Company, the owner of the John Deere brand, in the lead.
In 2015, Deere & Company reported $29 billion in sales, surpassing the $25 billion that Monsanto and Bayer made selling seeds and pesticides.
The most promising new opportunity for food corporations today lies in the digitization of agriculture.
This process is still in its early stages, but it is gathering momentum, and eventually it will cover all areas of production.
Soon enough, drones will take over the task of spraying pesticides; livestock will be equipped with sensors to track milk quantities, movement patterns, and feed rations; tractors will be controlled by GPS; and app-controlled sowing machines will assess soil quality to determine the optimal distance between rows and plants.
To maximize the benefits of these new technologies, the companies that already dominate the value chain have begun cooperating with one another.
The John Deeres and Monsantos have now joined forces.
The confluence of soil and weather “big data,” new agrotechnologies, genetically modified seeds, and new developments in agrochemistry will help these companies save money, protect natural resources, and maximize crop yields worldwide.
But while this possible future bodes well for some of the world’s largest companies, it leaves the environmental and social problems associated with industrialized agriculture unsolved.
Most farmers, particularly in the global South, will never be able to afford expensive digital-age machinery.
The maxim “grow or go” will be replaced with “digitize or disappear.”
The ETC Group, an American non-governmental organization, has already outlined a future scenario in which the major agrotechnology corporations move upstream and absorb the seed and pesticide producers.
At that point, just a few companies will determine everything that we eat.
Indeed, the same market-concentration problem applies to other links in the value chain, such as agricultural traders and supermarkets.
And even though food processing is not yet consolidated on a global scale, it is still dominated at the regional level by companies such as Unilever, Danone, Mondelez, and Nestlé. These companies make money when fresh or semi-processed food is replaced by highly processed convenience foods such as frozen pizza, canned soup, and ready-made meals.
While lucrative, this business model is closely linked to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.
Worse, food corporations are also profiting from the proliferation of illnesses for which they are partly responsible, by marketing “healthy” processed foods enriched with protein, vitamins, probiotics, and omega-3 fatty acids.
Meanwhile, corporations are amassing market power at the expense of those at the bottom of the value chain: farmers and workers.
International Labor Organization standards guarantee all workers the right to organize, and they prohibit forced and child labor and proscribe race and gender discrimination.
But labor-law violations have become the norm, because efforts to enforce ILO rules are often quashed, while trade union members are routinely threatened, fired, and even murdered.
In this hostile climate, minimum-wage, overtime-pay, and workplace-safety standards are openly neglected.
And women, in particular, are at a disadvantage, because they are paid less than their male counterparts and often must settle for seasonal or temporary jobs.
Today, half of the world’s 800 million starving people are small farmers and workers connected to the agricultural sector.
Their lot will hardly improve if the few companies already dominating that sector become even more powerful.

The Next Liberation of France
Ségolène Royal has turned the tables on the Socialist Party to become its standard bearer in next year’s election.
But her triumph is only part of an intense political debate of the sort France has not seen for decades.
With parliamentary and presidential elections next year, the stakes are as high as at any previous turning point in modern French history.
A unique feature of today’s debate is its cohort of public intellectuals like Jacques Marseille, Nicolas Baverez, Elie Cohen, and Stephane Rozes, none of whom subscribe to the hoary notion of French uniqueness (the so-called exception française ).
Their thinking is at the forefront of a widening recognition that France must face the world’s challenges as they really are, not as the French want them to be.
That means accepting and dealing with globalization.
France certainly has the tools to cope.
With only 1% of the world’s population, France is the sixth largest economy, ranking fourth in international trade and third in exports of goods and services.
More than 40% of the largest companies quoted on the Paris stock exchange are in foreign hands.
Indeed, one in seven workers is employed by a foreign company, compared to one in ten in the UK and one in 20 in the United States.
Productivity is relatively high, at $33 per hour, compared to $27 for the UK.
Moreover, France will enjoy large gains from exports to the fast-growing emerging world, since it produces more competitive high value-added goods than, for example, southern European countries, whose exports are closer to those of the leading emerging countries.
France could handle globalization, if not for the French state.
Its relatively poor business environment was highlighted by the World Bank’s latest Doing Business survey.
The section “Starting a business,” which identifies the bureaucratic and legal hurdles to incorporating and registering a new firm, ranks France in 35th place, whereas the UK ranks sixth and the US ranks third.
But the worst damage done by state policies is unemployment.
If there is an exception française , it is that for the past 30 years, the unemployment rate has never fallen below 8.5%.
If you exclude the cosseted army of public-sector workers, the rate approaches 15%.
Youth unemployment, including the female population, averages 23%, while in deprived suburbs with concentrated immigrant populations, the rate hits 70%.
Much of the political class and public opinion blames globalization – outsourcing and company relocations to cheaper labor markets – for unemployment.
But the chief culprit is France’s own labor code – a forest of regulations that offers the strongest employment protection anywhere in the world.
In the section “Employing workers” of Doing Business , France ranks 134th, compared to 17th for the UK and first for the US.
With employers unwilling to hire workers that they cannot easily fire, French young people are right to feel uncertain about their future.
Joblessness is the main cause of poverty.
The primary protection against poverty is earned income – for which even France’s generous unemployment benefits and other welfare payments are an inadequate substitute.
Much of the high tax burden required to finance them falls on companies in the form of payroll taxes (employers’ social security contributions), which further deter companies from taking on more staff.
Successive French governments have let this situation fester.
Dominique de Villepin’s government turned away from this challenge in favor of “economic patriotism” – that is, protecting supposed national champions from foreign takeover.
Despite comical episodes such as classifying the dairy company Danone as a national security asset to head off a possible bid from Coca Cola, France’s foreign investment regime is no less restrictive than other developed countries, including the US.
This scapegoating of globalization reflects another key problem.
Successive governments, not companies, are responsible for the most damaging outsourcing in France – that of responsibility.
Instead of proposing reforms to the electorate and then implementing them on the strength of a clear democratic mandate, the few serious reforms in the past 20 years have been presented as being externally imposed – mainly to comply with European Union requirements.
As a result, reform has come to seem illegitimate, which has strengthened resistance to it.
Breaking the impasse requires restoring political legitimacy by electing a president who, having promised reform, gains a mandate to deliver it.
Both leading contenders in the 2007 presidential election, Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy, share relative youth (compared to the geriatrics of recent decades) and have their fingers on the pulse of public opinion.
Their common approach is to enter into a real dialogue with the French people based on an understanding that the only viable basis for reform is a strong political contract between government and citizens.
This stands in sharp contrast to the reigns of François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, with their elitism, arrogance, paternalism, and stagnation.
Whatever the election’s outcome, the return of political will and legitimacy to France will come not a moment too soon.

The Moment When America Fell Behind
DENVER – As governments around the world adopt policies to address the immediate economic fallout of COVID-19, they are making decisions that will also determine their countries’ competitiveness for decades to come.
If designed correctly, stimulus and recovery packages can position countries and regions to reap the benefits of the industries of the future.
The European Union is already poised to speed ahead with the European Green Deal.
And China will inevitably build on its pre-pandemic competitive advantages in solar power, electric vehicles (EVs), and batteries.
The United States, on the other hand, is increasingly at risk of being left behind.
The European Green Deal is the perfect model for designing stimulus and recovery packages to create both immediate and long-term economic advantages.
In the short run, its proposed investments would produce many high-paying jobs in clean-energy infrastructure, funding the installation of more wind and solar facilities, EV charging stations, hydrogen production plants, and programs to retrofit buildings for energy efficiency.
Better still, over the long term, all of these investments will result in lower energy costs, more resilient energy systems, and a healthier population – among many other benefits.
The costs of clean-energy technologies have been falling rapidly, following predictable learning curves.
Over time, they will only become cheaper and faster to deploy on a greater scale.
Recognizing these advantages, Europe’s recovery efforts have already allocated billions of euros to build solar farms in Iberia and offshore wind turbines in the North Sea.
European companies such as Vestas, Siemens Gamesa, and others will do all the work.
And these expanded sources of cheap, renewable electricity will then be used to produce the hydrogen molecules that will power heavy industry in the future.
By earmarking €40 billion ($45 billion) for investment in hydrogen infrastructure, the European Green Deal aims to ensure that shipping, steel manufacturing, and other industries can run on clean fuel.
The EU has also set aside recovery funds to install two million electric and hydrogen vehicle charging stations, thereby stimulating demand for EVs that can be built locally by companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, and Renault.
In these and other ways, Europe is taking meaningful steps to catch up with China in green technologies.
Then again, if China were to introduce a stimulus and recovery package modeled after the European Green Deal, it could extend its competitive advantage into other forms of renewable energy, electric mobility, and hydrogen-powered industry.
As in Europe, investment in green infrastructure will produce millions of good jobs in the near term, while reducing or containing air pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions over the long term, even as the Chinese economy grows.
The clean air, quiet streets, and pristine views that became an accidental byproduct of the pandemic lockdown can be made permanent with cleaner forms of energy and transportation.
In the US, by contrast, though the federal government has taken some of the necessary steps to mitigate the short-term collapse of the economy, policymakers have thought little about the future.
That is why many of the dirty industries of the past are being bailed out.
A decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that America would lead the energy future, because it was approaching “energy independence,” owing to massive reserves of shale oil and gas that could now be extracted through hydraulic fracturing (fracking).
But those industries are now in structural decline.
The cost curves are clear: fossil fuels cannot compete with cheaper, more efficient, and clean-energy solutions.
By the same token, EVs will become steadily cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion engines, just as green hydrogen will become the energy of choice for increasingly decarbonized heavy industries.
Watching US President Donald Trump’s administration attempt to rescue jobs in coal mining, I am reminded of my first job after high school, when I worked in a typewriter factory in the south of the Netherlands.
Imagine if the Dutch government had for some reason decided to bail out that factory when personal computers started coming to market in the 1980s and 1990s.
It would have been investing in a museum, not in a viable industry.
While jobs in the fossil-fuel industry will be lost, many more jobs will be created to manufacture wind turbines and batteries, install solar panels, build EVs, retrofit buildings, and so forth.
The world is making the transition to clean energy, and those countries that are betting on the technologies of the past are digging their own economic graves.
Concerted industrial policies to build clean-energy infrastructure will do an enormous amount of good, not just for people and the planet, but also for countries’ economic competitiveness and future prosperity.
Europe and China understand this, and are already on track to become the leaders of the world economy in the coming decades.
They are actively leveraging their recovery packages to hasten that historic shift.
In Europe, especially, future generations will admire today’s leaders for creating jobs, driving down air pollution, and establishing a competitive economic position for decades to come.
In the US, not so much.

Regime Change in the Arab World
Four years into a disastrous military adventure in Iraq and with the global war on terror against ill-defined forces of darkness still inconclusive, the collapse of America’s grand strategy has exposed how ill-conceived was its simplistic recipe for democratic change in the Arab world.
The paradox is that America might be winning the war for Arab democracy, even if by default, but cannot reap the benefits, simply because the emerging pattern of Islamic pluralistic politics does not coincide with the West’s brand of secular liberal democracy.
The shift of the Arab world’s mainstream fundamentalist movements to democratic politics is tantamount to a repudiation of the jihadist project and of al-Qaeda’s apocalyptic strategies.
The failure of jihadism is paving the way for a potentially promising restructuring of Islamic politics, but the West either doesn’t recognize the changes or is hostile to them.
The rise of Islamists throughout the region as the sole power capable of exploiting the opportunities of free elections – Hamas’ victory in Palestine and the Muslim Brotherhood’s spectacular gains in the 2005 Egyptian elections are but the most noteworthy – the ascendancy to regional hegemony of Shiite Iran, and the sense among Arab rulers that the embattled Bush administration is running out of steam have all combined to stall the promising drive to political reform in the region.
The US retreated from its democratic designs once it realized that Arab democracy is not being identified with the liberal secular opposition, a political force that practically does not exist in the Arab world, but with Islamic radicals that are seek to repudiate America’s policies and the cause of reconciliation with Israel.
That this should be so has of course much to do with America’s traditional policy of sustaining the Arab world’s pro-Western dictators.
But the notion that the genii of democratization can now be squeezed back into the bottle is a self-serving fantasy.
The move of mainstream Islamists, like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Islamic Action Front in Jordan, Hamas in Palestine, the Renaissance Party in Tunisia, or the Party of Justice and Development in Morocco, away from jihadism to political participation started well before America’s democracy promotion campaign, and is not an attempt to please the West.
It is a genuine response to the needs and demands of their supporters.
Extinguishing Arab democracy, as President Mubarak of Egypt is now trying to do through his recent ban on political parties that are based on religion, will bring neither stability nor peace to the Middle East.
It will only exacerbate the rage of the masses at the West’s hypocrisy, now expressed in a form of democratic charlatanry.
The stability of those Arab regimes that are not sustained by a democratic consensus is bound to be fragile and misleading.
Just as Islamic democracy is the natural reaction to Arab secular autocracy and to the West’s collaboration with it, so will the destruction of political Islam usher in even more extreme options with movements like Hamas going back to social work and terror, and with al-Qaeda making inroads into Islamic societies.
Both the West and the Arab rulers need to realize that the tense equation between the incumbent regimes and political Islam is not necessarily a zero-sum game.
This has been learned the hard way by Algerian President Bouteflika who, through his Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation of February 2006, brought an end to a long and bloody civil war, the origins of which lay in the violent cancellation by the military of the Islamist Front’s (FIS) electoral victory in 1991.
It is in this context that the historic compromise between the religious (Hamas) and the secular (Fatah) to form a national unity government for Palestine might have established a new paradigm for the future of regime change in the Arab world.
The concept of national unity governments might, indeed, be the formula that makes it possible to hold together the political families in the Arab world.
King Muhammad VI of Morocco has already indicated that the Crown would consider a “historic compromise” with the Islamists should they, as predicted, win the elections in June 2007.
Such compromises may be the only way to stem the slide to civil war, and possibly also co-opt the Islamists into a settlement with Israel and a rapprochement to the West.
Engaging political Islam will need to be the central part of any successful strategy for the Middle East.
Instead of sticking to doomsday prophecies or to categorical perspectives that prevent an understanding of the complex fabric of Islamic movements, the West needs to keep the pressure on the incumbent regimes to stop circumventing political reform.
As Algeria in the 1990’s showed, exclusion of the Islamists is a recipe for disaster, while inclusion can breed moderation.
The practical necessities of politics are bound to dilute ideological purity.
The Mecca agreement that brought forth the unity government in Palestine will inevitably temper Hamas’ radicalism, just as the regime’s avoidance in Jordan of an “Egyptian solution” to the Islamist challenge allowed the Islamic Action Front to contain within the movement many who would have been otherwise drawn into the jihadist orbit.
The challenge is not how to destroy Islamic movements, but how to turn them away from revolutionary to reformist politics by granting them legitimate political space.

Europe’s Northern Lights
PARIS – “The Northern Lights” was the title of a major painting exhibition in Paris a few years ago, dedicated to Scandinavian masterpieces.
But “northern lights” may also correspond to what Europe, if not the entire West, needs nowadays: a political, economic, social, and ethical model.
Indeed, in becoming the first center-right leader in Sweden to win re-election in modern times, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt not only ended the centre-left’s electoral hegemony in his country, but revealed that the modern Scandinavian model of governance is relevant across Europe.
At a time when budget cuts are the order of the day, political power in Scandinavia is modest and generally honest.
Women play a major role in society and politics, and have for a long time.
Scandinavian capitalism has been traditionally more humane, and social injustice, though it exists, is much less destructive than in southern Europe, for example.
Moreover, immigrants are generally treated with a greater sense of respect for their dignity.
To be sure, many other Europeans recognize these “virtues.”
But their natural reaction is to say, “It’s not for us.”
In order to practice Scandinavian virtues, many believe, you must come from a cold-weather country with a small, homogeneous population that accepts high taxes without grumbling.
One can behave in such a manner, many Europeans outside of Scandinavia say, only if one has been raised according to the Protestant ethic.
For Greeks, Italians, and many French, evading taxes is a kind of national pastime, which some even perceive as a moral duty.
Politics is a game, and power a drug that allows you to rise above ordinary citizens.
And the temptation to consider oneself the incarnation of the state, rather than its servant, is often irresistible among southern European politicians.
Of course, it is dangerous to idealize the Scandinavian model.
Scandinavian countries have their share of problems, such as Denmark’s significant xenophobic extreme right and Norway’s occasional bouts of provincial puritanism.
But the difference between these countries and their southern counterparts in terms of economic performance, social climate, and political culture are plainly visible.
The weak and sick men of Europe – from Greece to Spain – are to be found in the south, not the north.
The Asian challenge, particularly from China, should encourage us to reconsider the validity of the “Scandinavian model.” For the Chinese example represents for Europeans a dual opportunity to moralize our capitalism and reinvent our democratic practices.
We cannot continue to preach to others values that we no longer practice with rigor.
To play the moral high ground, we must deserve it.
Moreover, we cannot simply wait for the Chinese “other” to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.
Of course, these contradictions are real, but our main source of strength cannot be their weakness.
The Chinese model – inspired nowadays not by Lenin but by Singapore’s decades of disciplined economic success – has called into question the traditional linkage (made since Adam Smith) between capitalism and democracy.
In China, capitalism prospers without democracy.
In fact, a contemporary Chinese joke is very indicative of how the country perceives its role in today’s world.
“In 1949, communism saved China; in 1979 capitalism saved China; and in 2009, China saved capitalism.”
In the aftermath of a major financial and economic crisis – which may yet be far from over – Chinese and Asians in general ask Europeans rather bluntly how we dare try to teach them lessons in financial capitalism.
After all, during the Asian financial crisis in 1998, “we” did not come to their aid; ten years later, “they” saved us.
China today is increasingly becoming for Europe what the United States was yesterday – a mirror reflecting our weaknesses and our strengths.
We are too few to become anything other than a “niche of excellence” in the character of our capitalism and our democratic practices, both of which are endangered above all by ourselves.
Nothing incites failure more than success.
Since the end of the Cold War, we Europeans have lost the incentive to demonstrate the superiority of our systems.
We have become complacent and lazy.
In this context, looking north is essential if we want to regain our universal attractiveness and defend our “democratic” comparative advantages.
There is more rigor and openness under the Northern Lights, and this is precisely the combination we need, with its mixture of modesty towards others and ambition towards ourselves.

The UK’s Immigration Distraction
LONDON – Do British voters hate foreigners, or merely freeloaders?
That is essentially the question British Prime Minister David Cameron posed in his long-awaited speech on immigration from other European Union countries, delivered last month at the headquarters of the construction-equipment manufacturer JCB.
Cameron’s gamble is that voters do not mind Poles or Lithuanians operating JCB’s machines on construction sites all over the United Kingdom.
What they mind is people immigrating to the UK to take advantage of its welfare benefits.
The speech was Cameron’s answer to the recent defections of two of his Conservative Party MPs to the anti-EU, anti-immigration UK Independence Party, which he fears could steal Conservative votes in the general election next May.
But, as clever as the speech was, it is unlikely to succeed in beating back UKIP – and it leaves the British debate about EU membership focused on the wrong issue.
To be sure, Cameron’s speech was a more statesmanlike gamble than many – even within his own government – had anticipated.
Some of his remarks in recent weeks had suggested that he might reject outright the free movement of EU citizens – one of the union’s founding principles – and dare other European governments to oppose him.
Instead, Cameron emphasized the UK’s enduring desire to be open to the world while restricting EU migrants’ welfare rights.
Specifically, he proposed requiring EU migrants to spend four years working in the UK before becoming eligible for the top-up welfare payments that low-paid British workers receive, and to end benefit payments for migrant workers’ children living in their home country.
Though such moves could be challenged in the European Court of Justice on grounds of discrimination, any cases are unlikely to arise until well after the upcoming election.
The political danger for the Conservatives is that they are misjudging public sentiment.
Perhaps voters have just as much of a problem with foreigners as they do with freeloaders.
If that is the case, reducing immigrants’ welfare benefits will be inadequate.
This is not to say that Cameron should target foreigners.
On the contrary, he must change the conversation to reassure voters that their economic future is bright.
As it stands, the British, like their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, feel overtaxed for spotty public services that are constantly being cut, and are angry that their incomes have been falling for the last five years.
As a result, many resent welfare recipients and fear competition for jobs – a sentiment that is fueling the rise of populist, anti-EU, and anti-immigrant parties across Europe.
The key difference in the UK is that UKIP is gaining ground with voters despite rapid economic growth (more than 3% annually, the highest rate in the EU).
Between now and May, Cameron must persuade voters that the British economy will continue to perform strongly, fueling an increase in real incomes.
A change of subject would also be in the national interest.
By banging on about immigration, Cameron risks making it central to the question of whether Britain should remain in the EU.
He is, after all, the politician who has promised to hold a referendum in 2017, if he is still Prime Minister, on whether to stay or leave, following a period variously described as a “renegotiation” of the UK’s membership and “reform” of the EU’s structure.
He is now making it seem as if immigration will be the key test of that effort.
That is a big problem.
For starters, there is little or nothing that other EU governments can concede on the free movement of people, which is enshrined in the founding document of European integration, the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
In any case, Britain receives more migrants from outside the EU than from other EU countries.
And migrants from Poland, Italy, or France are much more likely than those from Somalia, Syria, or India to return home eventually.
If the British public truly opposes immigration, they are probably referring to non-EU immigration, not the arrival of, say, Italian university graduates.
In fact, there is a far more important issue that should serve as the main focus of the British debate on the EU: the UK’s future status inside the EU as a non-member of the eurozone.
This is what Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne were focusing on until UKIP surged in the opinion polls.
It is time to renew that focus.
Cameron’s government must recognize that there is only one good reason to wonder whether the UK might be better off leaving the EU: the risk that remaining outside of the eurozone would leave Britain at a serious disadvantage in EU decision-making, even about rules affecting the single market.
It sounds a bit technical, and it is.
But sorting out the relationship between EU members within and outside the eurozone can be done in a fairly short time without new treaties; indeed, progress has already been made on this front.
Cameron and Osborne would then be able to boast that they have procured for the British public the best of both worlds: much faster economic growth than the stagnant eurozone members, together with all of the advantages of EU membership, including access to the single market and enhanced global influence.
That narrative would be far more powerful than a few tweaks to welfare rights for immigrants.

Austerity under Attack
BRUSSELS – Europe seems to be obsessed with austerity.
Country after country is being forced by either the financial markets or the European Union to start cutting its public-sector deficit.
And, as if this were not enough, 25 of the 27 EU member states have just agreed on a new treaty (called a “fiscal compact”) that would oblige them never to have a cyclically adjusted budget deficit of more than 0.5% of GDP.
(For comparison, the United States’ budget deficit in 2011 was close to 8% of GDP).
But, as the European economy risks falling into recession, many observers are asking whether “austerity” could be self-defeating.
Could a reduction in government expenditure (or an increase in taxes) lead to such a sharp decline in economic activity that revenues fall and the fiscal position actually deteriorates further?
This is highly unlikely, given the way our economies work.
Moreover, if it were true, it would follow that tax cuts would reduce budget deficits, because faster economic growth would generate higher revenues, even at lower tax rates.
This proposition has been tested several times in the US, where tax cuts were invariably followed by higher deficits.
In Europe, the concern today is instead with the debt/GDP ratio.
The worry here is that the GDP drop resulting from “austerity” might be so large that the debt ratio increases.
This matters, because investors often use the debt ratio as an indicator of financial sustainability.
Thus, a lower deficit might actually heighten tensions in financial markets.
However, a lower deficit must lead over time to a lower debt ratio, even if this ratio worsens in the short run.
After all, most models used to assess the economic impact of fiscal policy imply that a cut in expenditure, for example, lowers demand in the short run, but that the economy recovers after a while to its previous level.
So, in the long run, fiscal policy has no lasting impact (or only a very small one) on output.
This implies that whatever short-run negative impact lower demand may have on the debt ratio should be offset later (in the medium to long run) by the rebound in demand that brings the economy back to its previous output level.
Moreover, even assuming that the impact of a permanent cut in public expenditure on demand and output is also permanent, the GDP reduction remains a one-off phenomenon, whereas the lower deficit continues to have a positive impact on the debt level year after year.
Notice that this conclusion was reached without any recourse to what Paul Krugman and others have derided as the “confidence fairy.”
In the US, it might indeed be unreasonable to expect that a lower deficit translates into a lower risk premium – for the simple reason that the US government pays already ultra-low interest rates.
But, even without any confidence effects, the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has concluded that, while cutting the US deficit does lower demand, it still leads reliably to a lower debt ratio.
This should be all the more true for eurozone countries, like Italy or Spain, that are now paying risk premia in excess of 3-4%.
For these countries, the confidence fairy has become a monster.
The decisive question then becomes: What matters more, the impact of deficit cutting on the debt/GDP ratio in the short run or in the long run?
Prospective buyers of Italian ten-year bonds should look at the longer-term impact of deficit cutting on the debt level, which is pretty certain to be positive.
Of course, some market participants might not be rational, demanding a higher risk premium following a short-term deterioration of the debt ratio.
But those concentrating on the short term risk losing money, because the risk premium will eventually decline when the debt ratio turns around.
Abandoning austerity out of fear that financial markets might be short-sighted would only postpone the day of reckoning, because debt ratios would increase in the long run.
Moreover, it is highly unlikely that Italy, for example, would pay a lower risk premium if it ran larger deficits.
It would be dangerous for the eurozone’s highly indebted countries to abandon austerity now.
Any country that enters a period of heightened risk aversion with a large debt overhang faces only bad choices.
Implementing credible austerity plans constitutes the lesser evil, even if this aggravates the cyclical downturn in the short run.

Deepening NAFTA
The good news about NAFTA is that there is little news about NAFTA.
That quiet, so different from the protests that greeted the North American Free Trade Area's creation a decade ago, reflects NAFTA's clear achievement in facilitating and integrating economic exchange among its three partners.
Next week's meeting between the Mexican and American presidents should take advantage of this success to push NAFTA forward in creative new ways.
Luckily, a road map for NAFTA exists.
When the then President-elect Vicente Fox of Mexico traveled to the United States and Canada in the fall of 2000, he carried a bold proposal: after eight years it was time for Canada, the US and Mexico to establish a longer-term goal of creating a North American Community.
Although his unorthodox suggestion met with skepticism, his ideas established an agenda that NAFTA's three partners should pursue.
Why fix what is not broken?
Because, from Mexico's perspective, NAFTA has not yet achieved one of its key goals: to deliver the benefits of free trade to all of the country's regions and sectors.
For NAFTA to realize its full potential and move the convergence process, opening borders to trade and reducing tariff barriers are not enough.
Since its founding in 1994, NAFTA has been characterized (at best) by a bilateral management of issues and problems.
Too often, the US has taken a unilateral approach.
Trilateral or sub-regional cooperation is our goal.
As it stands, Mexico and Canada have been limited to dealing with the US on an individual basis because the three countries - for different reasons - prefer to keep separate bilateral links with their neighbors.
The result of this is to neglect the overall North American perspective while giving preference to a domestic or bilateral vision that sometimes fails to promote the larger objective of integration.
To promote a regional perspective, Mexico, Canada, and the US must consider establishing an institutional forum where such discussions can take place and where recommendations to governments can emerge.
This is especially the case as the three countries assess the feasibility of common migration policies, border development and infrastructure, shared natural resources, environmental protection, economic and social policy coordination, and other issues of common concern.
Several concrete proposals have been advanced on how to achieve this.
At a minimum, a North American Commission or coordinating mechanism should be set up to begin the process.
While the European Commission model may not be what NAFTA needs, the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the US should establish a permanent mechanism for channeling ideas and proposals, and transforming those ideas into action.
One area ripe for an institutional mechanism is energy.
North America shares one of the richest and most varied energy resource pools in the world.
Having excluded energy from the original NAFTA talks, Canada and Mexico are now willing to engage with the US on a common energy strategy.
Indeed, talks on the subject have taken place among ministers from the three countries.
As each advances its domestic energy strategy, identifying synergies can help in rationalizing and making optimum use of what energy resources are available.
Another example of the new regional agenda can be found in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11 th .
Protecting North America and securing its borders has become a major priority in the fight against international terrorism and there must be a common response.
Having created a functioning, regional, open trade area, the three countries must ensure that the new imperative to secure borders does not obstruct legitimate flows of goods, services and people.
A NAFTA-wide security perimeter could transform internal borders in much the same way that the Schengen Agreement transformed borders within much of continental Europe.
The re-casting of the bilateral agenda on migration between Mexico and the US, well underway prior to 9/11, must be reconciled with America's new concept of homeland security.
While some argue that the fight against terrorism is the natural enemy of regularizing migration, others agree that now more than ever the countries of North America need to address this issue trilaterally.
Migration, security, energy, labor and the other issues that make up the North American agenda must be discussed, managed and implemented in trilateral bodies with the expertise necessary to identify, harmonize and eventually converge policy-making for the region.
This requires greater communication between and among decision-makers in all three NAFTA members.
The agenda and timetable for convergence must be set by NAFTA's elected leaders, but implementation should be in the hands of a new commission.
Possible subjects for that commission's agenda include: financial, fiscal and customs harmonization; transport infrastructure; natural resources and regional development.
There are, of course, many other issues, some of which already receive intensive cooperative efforts, especially in the fields of combating organized crime, drug and human trafficking, and the cross-border flow of contraband.
In any case, problems need to be identified so that opportunities for cooperation are created.
Today's challenge is to renew NAFTA by adding the concept of partnership to it.
Although recognizing that much still divides us, major common goals do provide a solid foundation for future cooperation.
All three countries now find themselves at a juncture favorable to building a North American Commission to address the needs of the North American Community.
We should seize the moment and proceed with negotiations to create such a forum.

Down with “Emerging Markets”
LONDON – It has been nine years since I coined the acronym “BRIC,” which has become synonymous with the rise of Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
It has been more than seven years since my colleagues at Goldman Sachs and I first published an outlook to 2050 in which we suggested that the four BRIC economies could emerge bigger than the G-7 economies, and, together with the United States, would constitute the world’s five largest.
It also has been more than five years since the expression “Next Eleven,” or “N-11,” first appeared.
That term bracketed the next eleven largest countries by population, and sought to determine their BRIC-like potential.
These 15 countries drive most of the positive momentum behind the world economy nowadays.
China has overtaken Japan as the world’s second largest economy, with output roughly equal to that of the other three BRIC countries combined.
Their aggregate GDP stands at around $11 trillion, or about 80% of the US level.
Domestic demand in the BRIC countries is even more impressive.
The collective dollar value of BRIC consumers is estimated conservatively at just over $4 trillion, possibly $4.5 trillion.
The US consumer market is worth more than double that – around $10.5 trillion – but BRIC consumer power is currently growing at an annual rate in dollar terms of around 15%, which means an annual rate of roughly $600 billion.
If this pace is maintained, BRIC consumers will be adding another $1 trillion to the global economy by the middle of this decade.
By the end of the decade, they will be worth more than US consumers.
Indeed, at some point during this decade, the BRIC economies combined will become as big as the US economy, with China’s GDP alone reaching about two-thirds that of the US.
The four countries will be responsible for at least one-half of real GDP growth in the world, and possibly as much as 70%.
Beyond the BRICs, among the likely top ten contributors to global GDP growth this decade are South Korea, Mexico, and Turkey.
From the so-called developed world, only the US is guaranteed a place on this list – and the top 20 could include Iran, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
So how should we now think about the term “emerging markets”?
A few weeks ago, I decided with my colleagues to pursue the term ��growth economies,” which Goldman Sachs adopted in 2010 to describe how we treat many of the world’s most dynamic markets.
At its simplest, a growth economy should be regarded as one that is likely to experience rising productivity, which, together with favorable demographics, points to economic growth that outpaces the global average.
But an economy also needs sufficient size and depth in order to allow investors not only to invest, but also to exit when appropriate.
So we opted for the following: any economy outside the so-called developed world that accounts for at least 1% of current global GDP should be defined as a growth economy.
At this size, currently around $600 billion, an economy should be large enough to allow investors and businesses to operate as they do in advanced countries, yet also be likely to grow faster.
All other economies should continue to be defined as emerging markets.
According to this definition, eight countries currently qualify: the BRIC countries, along with South Korea, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey, while others – including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, and the Philippines – could join the list in the next 20 years.
It is also time that investors started to benchmark their portfolios more appropriately.
In the past few decades, it has become conventional for equity investors to base their decisions on neutral benchmarks determined by the market capitalization of companies and indices.
But this gives much more weight to the US economy and its companies relative to so-called emerging markets.
An alternative approach is to use a GDP-weighted benchmark.
For bold and aggressive investors, a benchmark that incorporates future predicted GDP gives a lot more weight to emerging markets, especially to the growth economies.
The index that Goldman Sachs calculates every year for around 180 countries, called a Growth Environment Score (GES), is used to monitor productivity and the likelihood of sustainable growth.
The index goes from 0 to 10, with 13 sub-indices for overall growth and productivity.
Currently, for example, Korea’s GES is 7.5, compared to 6.9 for the US.
Economies that remain small and have low GES scores are appropriately treated as emerging markets with lots of risk.
While they may grow significantly and escape from their current situation, they are vulnerable to adverse developments in core developed countries – especially the US – and in these countries’ financial markets.
Countries with low GES scores need to undertake policies that allow them to rise.
For example, we forecast that within the next 20 years Nigeria, home to around 20% of Africa’s population, could account for 1% of global GDP.
But its current GES score of 3.9 is significantly below the BRIC and N-11 average.
On the other hand, Nigeria’s economy has almost doubled in size over the last 13 years.
If it maintains this progress, before 2030 it will no longer be an “emerging economy.”
That would be an exciting development for Nigeria – and for Africa.
Even more exciting is the likelihood that Nigeria will not be alone at its graduation into a growth economy.

From Global Imbalances to Effective Global Governance
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA – The current credit crisis has led to scaled-back projections for growth around the world.
Governments and central banks are responding to damaged balance sheets and credit lockups in an attempt to limit extreme harm to their economies outside the financial sector.
In the United States, the financial sector is undergoing a high-speed but permanent structural transformation, the effects of which could be severe for developing countries’ economic growth.
Indeed, these countries are already experiencing large relative price increases for food and oil, a food emergency for the poor, and higher rates of inflation induced by commodity price shifts.
While rapid growth in developing countries has been an important factor in the rising commodity prices, much of this is beyond their control.
For the past two years, my colleagues and I on the Growth Commission have sought to learn how 13 developing countries managed to record growth rates averaging 7% or more for 25 years or longer.
In The Growth Report , published in May, we tried to understand why most developing countries fell far short of this achievement, and explored how they might emulate the fast growers.
Sustained high growth is enabled by and requires engagement with the global economy that goes beyond simply being able to produce for a potentially massive export market.
It also involves, crucially, importing an essential intangible asset: knowledge.
Economies can learn faster than they can invent, so less developed countries can achieve much faster growth than was experienced by today’s industrialized countries when they were becoming wealthy.
Because of the importance of the global economy, the destiny of developing countries is not entirely in the hands of their leaders, workforces, and entrepreneurs.
Today, there are potential adverse global trends and challenges, many of which are relatively new developments that the 13 high-growth cases did not face.
The most immediate is financial distress emanating mainly, but not exclusively, from the US and spilling out to hit all sectors of the global economy.
This was and is the result of an asset bubble fueled by excessive leverage and by the massive transparency issues associated with complex securities and derivatives that were supposed to spread risk, but instead mainly increased the systemic risk already present with excess debt.
Much has become clear.
First, extreme financial distress can bring down the real economy, with a shortage of credit being the most potent channel.
Second, the current regulatory structure is not adequate to ensure stability in the US economy.
America’s light, incomplete, and fragmented pattern of regulation will not survive, and it will not be used as a model in other parts of the world.
Third, contributing factors included low interest rates, compressed risk spreads, and global imbalances that accommodated low savings in the US, consumption in excess of output, and a mounting trade deficit.
Absent the willingness of large developing countries to run trade surpluses and high savings rates relative to investment, the asset bubble in the US – leading to a rise in domestic consumption and a fall in the savings rate – would have triggered inflation and higher interest rates.
That would have put a partial brake on growth in asset prices, raised savings, reduced investment, and probably lowered the trade deficit.
But the automatic stabilizers that normally kick in did not.
In general, automatic stabilizers may not kick in across the global economy, which means that policies need to be coordinated.
Fourth, regulatory structures will need to be rebuilt, and this will require a global effort.
Absent international coordination, the opportunities for destructive regulatory competition will defeat regulatory reform.
Finally, both the interdependence and global risk that are evident in this crisis will and probably should cause countries to adopt policies with respect to financial structures that provide for some insulation from external shocks, even if such policies impose a cost.
The interdependencies in the global economy (in areas as diverse as financial markets, product safety, infectious diseases, natural resource dependency, and global warming) have outrun our collective capacity to manage them and coordinate policy responses.
Restoring that balance will take time, leadership, a shift in attitudes, and creativity.
In the interim, the mismatch creates risks for everyone, including developing countries.
It creates skepticism about whether the net benefits of openness are positive, and uncertainty about what adaptations are needed in the regulation of free markets to achieve a reasonable balance between their benefits and risks.
Influential developing countries share a joint responsibility with the G-8 for the stability of the global financial and economic systems.
But they currently have limited channels for discharging that responsibility and influencing global policies.
In addition, collectively we must do a better job of anticipating problems rather than being in reactive mode in the face of crises.
The global economy and its increasing openness made it possible for three billion people to enjoy the fruits of growth in the postwar period.
It may also provide an economic springboard for another two billion people to fulfill their aspirations in the coming decades.
But openness brings risks, many unanticipated and most under-managed.
People are skeptical for understandable reasons, and in the case of the credit crisis, angry.
Openness needs protecting and the best way to protect it is to manage the areas of growing interdependence effectively, pragmatically and inclusively.

Who Should Be Bailed Out?
CAMBRIDGE – As governments around the world develop policies to deal with failing financial institutions, they should be sure to pick their beneficiaries wisely.
In particular, they should study and avoid the mistakes made in the AIG bailout in late 2008.
A United States Special Inspector General recently issued a report criticizing the US government for failing to insist that AIG’s counterparties in the market for financial derivatives bear some of the costs of bailing out the company.
Indeed, bailouts of failed institutions should never extend the government’s safety net to such counterparties.
The AIG bailout was one of the largest in history, with the US government injecting more than $100 billion into the company.
The bailout was brought about by AIG’s large losses on derivative transactions with financial institutions, mostly sophisticated players such as Goldman Sachs and Spain’s Banco Santander.
After the government’s infusion of funds in September 2008, AIG’s losses continued to mount, so the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later.
At this point, the government asked AIG’s derivative counterparties to take a voluntary “haircut” – that is, accept a discount on the amount owed to them.
When some of these parties refused, the government backed down and financed AIG’s payment of all of its derivative obligations in full.
The US government felt that it had a weak hand, because it was not prepared to allow AIG to default on any of its obligations.
This was a mistake.
The government should have been prepared to place AIG into reorganization under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code and force the derivative parties to take the desired haircut.
AIG is a holding company, and most of its business is conducted through insurance subsidiaries organized as separate legal entities.
The huge losses on derivate transactions were generated by AIG’s financial products unit.
Although this unit was also a separate legal entity, AIG guaranteed its obligations toward derivative counterparties.
Had the government placed AIG into Chapter 11 reorganization in November 2008, AIG’s creditors, including its derivative counterparties, would have ended up with the value of AIG’s assets, which consisted mainly of shares in AIG’s insurance subsidiaries.
Without necessarily affecting the operations of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, the reorganization process would have simply shifted ownership of AIG’s assets from AIG’s existing shareholders to AIG’s creditors.
To the extent that the value of these assets would not have been sufficient to cover all of the derivative creditors’ claims, they would have had to bear some losses.
Would that have been an unacceptable outcome?
Not at all.
The government’s reluctance to use such a process might have been motivated by AIG’s major role in insurance markets around the world. But a reorganization of AIG and a shift in its ownership should not have been expected to endanger insurance policyholders.
The insurance subsidiaries were not responsible for the obligations of their parent company, and their claims toward policyholders were backed by required reserves.
In any event, concerns about insurance policyholders should have led, at most, to a governmental commitment to back their claims if necessary.
It did not require taxpayers to bail out the parent company’s derivative counterparties.
The government might also have been motivated by concerns that losses to the derivative counterparties would deplete the capital of some significant financial institutions at a difficult time.
Again, such concerns would have been better addressed in different ways – in particular, by providing institutions that needed capital with funds directly, and in return for securities.
To address a potential capital shortage at Goldman Sachs, say, taxpayers would have been better off providing $13 billon to Goldman in exchange for Goldman securities with adequate value, rather than footing the bill for the $13 billion that AIG gave to Goldman.
In the future, governments should not bail out failing financial institutions’ derivative counterparties, even when they provide a safety net to some of these institutions’ creditors (such as depositors).
Governments should not only follow such a policy, but also make absolutely clear in advance their commitment to doing so.
Communicating such a commitment clearly would induce parties to derivative transactions not to rely on a governmental safety net, but to monitor whether their partners have adequate reserves.
A governmental commitment to exclude derivative creditors from any safety net extended when financial institutions fail would reduce future costs to taxpayers from cases like AIG.
Indeed, it would reduce the likelihood that cases like AIG would ever arise.

Making the Euro Whole
NEW YORK – The architects of the euro knew that it was incomplete when they designed it.
The euro had a common central bank but no common treasury.
This was unavoidable, because the Maastricht Treaty was meant to bring about a monetary union without a political union.
European authorities were confident, however, that if and when the euro ran into a crisis, they would be able to overcome it.
After all, that is how the European Union was created, taking one step at a time, knowing full well that additional steps would be required.
With hindsight, one can identify other deficiencies in the euro of which its architects were unaware.
The euro was supposed to bring about economic convergence, but it produced divergences instead, because its architects did not realize that imbalances may emerge not only in the public sector, but in the private sector as well.
After the euro came into force, commercial banks could refinance their holdings of government bonds at the discount window of the European Central Bank, and regulators treated government bonds as riskless.
This caused interest-rate differentials between various countries to shrink, which generated real-estate booms in the weaker economies and reduced their competitiveness.
At the same time, Germany, suffering from the after-effects of reunification, had to tighten its belt.
Trade unions agreed to concessions on wages and working conditions in exchange for job security.
That is how the divergences emerged.
Yet the banks continued to load up on the government bonds of the weaker countries in order to benefit from the minuscule interest-rate differentials that still remained.
The consequences of the lack of a common treasury first became apparent after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when governments, in order to prevent financial markets from collapsing, had to guarantee that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail.
At that time, Angela Merkel rejected a Europe-wide guarantee, insisting that each country should guarantee its own institutions.
Interestingly, interest-rate differentials widened only in 2010, when the newly elected Greek government announced that the previous government had vastly understated the true fiscal deficit.
That was the start of the euro crisis.
The lack of a common treasury is now in the process of being remedied, first by a rescue package for Greece, then by creating a temporary emergency facility, and – the financial authorities being a little bit pregnant – eventually by establishing some permanent institution.
Unfortunately, it is equally certain that the new arrangements will also be flawed.
Besides the lack of a common treasury, the euro suffers from other shortcomings, which the authorities do not seem to have fully understood.
This complicates matters enormously.
The authorities are confronted by not only a currency crisis, but also a banking crisis and a crisis in macroeconomic theory.
The authorities are committing at least two mistakes.
One is that the bondholders of insolvent banks are being protected at the expense of taxpayers for fear of provoking a financial crisis.
This is politically unacceptable.
The Irish government elected next spring is bound to repudiate the current arrangements.
Markets recognize this, which is why the Irish rescue brought no relief.
Second, high interest rates charged on rescue packages make it impossible for weaker countries to improve their competitiveness vis-à-vis stronger ones.
Divergences will continue to widen, and weaker countries will continue to weaken indefinitely.
Mutual resentment between creditors and debtors is liable to grow, and there is a real danger that the euro may destroy the EU’s political and social cohesion.
Both mistakes can be corrected.
With regard to the first, emergency funds ought to be used to recapitalize the banking systems, as well as to provide loans to sovereign states.
The former would be a more efficient use of funds than the latter.
Properly capitalizing the banking system would leave countries with smaller deficits, enabling them to regain access to capital markets sooner.
It is better to inject equity into the banks now rather than later, and it is better to do it on a Europe-wide basis than leave each country to act on its own.
This would create a European regulatory regime.
Europe-wide regulation of banks encroaches on national sovereignty less than European control over fiscal policy.
And European control over banks is less amenable to political abuse than national control.
With regard to the second problem, the interest rate on rescue packages should be reduced to the rate at which the EU itself can borrow on the market.
This would have the advantage of developing an active Eurobond market.
These two structural changes may not be sufficient to provide the eurozone countries in need of rescue an escape route from their predicament.
Additional measures, such as “haircuts” for holders of sovereign debt, may be needed.
Having been properly recapitalized, banks could absorb this, and two obvious mistakes that condemn the EU to a bleak future would be remedied.

The Think-Tank Dilemma
TOKYO – The Brookings Institution in Washington, DC – perhaps the world’s top think tank – is under scrutiny for receiving six-figure donations from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which many consider to be a security threat.
And since the barbaric murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October, many other Washington-based think tanks have come under pressure to stop accepting donations from Saudi Arabia.
These recent controversies have given rise to a narrative that Washington-based think tanks are facing a funding crisis.
In fact, traditional think tanks are confronting three major challenges that have put them in a uniquely difficult situation.
Not only are they facing increased competition from for-profit think tanks such as the McKinsey Global Institute and the Eurasia Group; they also must negotiate rising geopolitical tensions, especially between the United States and China.
And complicating matters further, many citizens, goaded by populist harangues, have become dismissive of “experts” and the fact-based analyses that think tanks produce (or at least should produce).
With respect to the first challenge, Daniel Drezner of Tufts University argues in The Ideas Industry: How Pessimists, Partisans, and Plutocrats are Transforming the Marketplace of Ideas that for-profit think tanks have engaged in thought leadership by operating as platforms for provocative thinkers who push big ideas.
Whereas many non-profit think tanks – as well as universities and non-governmental organizations – remain “old-fashioned” in their approach to data, their for-profit counterparts thrive by finding the one statistic that captures public attention in the digital age.
Given their access to both public and proprietary information, for-profit think tanks are also able to maximize the potential of big data in ways that traditional think tanks cannot.
Moreover, with the space for balanced foreign-policy arguments narrowing, think tanks are at risk of becoming tools of geopolitical statecraft. This is especially true now that US-China relations are deteriorating and becoming more ideologically tinged.
Over time, foreign governments of all stripes have cleverly sought to influence policymaking not only in Washington, but also in London, Brussels, Berlin, and elsewhere, by becoming significant donors to think tanks.
Governments realize that the well-connected think tanks that act as “power brokers” vis-à-vis the political establishment have been facing fundraising challenges since the 2008 financial crisis.
In some cases, locally based think tanks have even been accused of becoming fronts for foreign authoritarian governments.
In terms of shadowy influence-peddling, China’s actions have been particularly concerning.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has explicitly encouraged his country’s think tanks to “advance the Chinese narrative” globally.
And in many cases, China-based think tanks have become instruments for expanding the country’s sphere of influence.
According to a report by the European Council on Foreign Relations, China’s Belt and Road Initiative, with its need for complex coordination, has created the perfect policy space for think tanks that “tell a good China story” to prosper.
These include networks such as SiLKS and individual think tanks such as the Charhar Institute, which also recently established a “National Committee for China-US Relations.”
Given their links to the Chinese government, these organizations threaten to muddy the waters in which genuinely independent think tanks operate.
But the most significant threat to think tanks is coming from the global populist backlash against “experts” and evidence-based research.
As Michael D. Rich and Jennifer Kavanagh of the RAND Corporation have argued, we are currently living through a period of “truth decay.”
The line between fact and opinion has become blurred, and people have increasingly grown distrustful of respected sources of information and data.
Populist politicians have both exploited and accelerated this phenomenon, by depicting experts as “enemies of the people” and think tanks as “ivory institutions” that are out of touch with the concerns of everyday citizens.
These pressures are combining to erode civil discourse, critical thinking, and thus the foundations of liberal democracies.
To survive, traditional think tanks must innovate while staying true to their principles.
As a start, they should draw on their unique power to convene thinkers from across the political spectrum.
By creating a forum for members of civil society to debate major policy issues, think tanks can help to build a consensus and encourage cross-party cooperation.
The need for think tanks to reaffirm their core purpose of validating evidence-based arguments has never been more urgent.
Whereas corporate interests often sway the conclusions of for-profit think tanks, non-profit think tanks can and must offer independent and accurate analyses to help the public understand an increasingly complex world.
Think tanks also should maximize the potential of technology to unmask authoritarian influence.
As matters stand, the shortage of information about authoritarian governments benefits such regimes.
One promising model for addressing this problem is the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, which has used satellite imagery to track and expose China’s militarization and construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea.
Finally, governments of like-minded democracies must come together to protect the status of independent think tanks as a vital pillar of the liberal order.
Even in hard financial times, when supporting independent research may seem like a luxury, the role of think tanks in promoting evidence-based policymaking is indispensable.
Let us not forget that think tanks emerge and thrive during times of crisis.
Just as World War I gave rise to the Council on Foreign Relations and Chatham House, the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster led to the formation of the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation (now the Asia Pacific Initiative, which I lead).
At the end of the day, there can be no liberal international order without critical policy debates. The contributions of think tanks are vital to those debates’ success.

An External Stability Pact for Europe
BERLIN – The current economic crisis has exposed two fundamental problems in the design of the European Monetary Union.
The first concerns the sustainability of public finances in a number of euro-zone member states.
Second, inadequate macroeconomic policy coordination has resulted in divergences in the international competitiveness of euro-zone members, threatening the very existence of the euro.
Countries whose public finances seemed fundamentally sound as late as last year have come under severe fiscal pressure.
Ireland’s government debt is expected to rise to almost 80% of GDP by 2010, whereas just a year ago the European Commission projected that Ireland’s government debt would be below 30% of GDP.
Likewise, whereas Spain was expected to decrease its debt ratio, its debt-to-GDP ratio is now likely to double between 2007 and 2010, to more than 60%.
The EU’s fiscal surveillance mechanisms failed to predict these developments because they neglect a crucial variable: the dynamics of private-sector debt.
Given the high economic costs of a banking crisis, governments are likely to take on the liabilities of their financial sector when a crisis hits – as recently occurred in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and in financial crises in Latin America and Asia in the 1990’s.
The same is probably true when key business sectors near insolvency.
A country with sound public finances can thus become a fiscal basket case practically overnight.
Given the increasingly close financial and economic linkages between euro-zone members, rising government debt in even one EMU country can have serious consequences for all members, because no member state will allow another to default.
Thus, EMU members indirectly share the liability for fellow countries’ private-sector debt, which for this reason should be monitored within the EMU’s surveillance framework.
Another apparent problem is that EMU member states – at least until now – do not coordinate their economic policies effectively.
Even before the crisis, this resulted in divergences in competitiveness and in the business cycle.
The persistent loss in competitiveness over the past decade is one reason why the crisis is hitting some southern European EMU countries such as Spain and Italy so hard.
The inefficiency of fiscal-policy control and the lack of economic convergence are a matter of increasing concern to both the European Central Bank and euro-zone finance ministers.
While no initiative for coping with these problems has been tabled so far, the issue is certain to become a matter of debate within the EMU.
One way to tackle the problems associated with government debt, as well as to improve economic policy coordination, is through a simple extension of existing rules: an “External Stability Pact” could be introduced to complement current EMU regulations.
This pact would monitor current-account imbalances and penalize excessive deficits or surpluses in the external account.
Monitoring external balances can be an effective tool to measure future default risks, since sustained current-account deficits lead to a growth in net foreign debt.
Moreover, there is a direct relationship between the EMU countries’ private-sector debt dynamics and their current-account imbalances within the euro zone.
So long as a national government is not running more than a modest deficit, a current-account deficit reflects the private sector’s borrowing from abroad (or the sale of previously accumulated foreign assets).
If the current-account balance is assessed together with the fiscal position, it becomes possible to draw conclusions about risky debt trends within the private sector.
The mathematics of debt dynamics suggest that no euro-zone country should have a current-account imbalance, whether a deficit or a surplus, of more than 3% of GDP.
Exceptions could be granted for countries with large inflows of foreign direct investment in greenfield projects.
The rule should apply both to debtor and creditor countries.
After all, payment imbalances always have two sides, and the burden of adjustment should not be borne only by deficit countries.
Such a pact would oblige governments to use fiscal and wage policies as well as overall economic policy to achieve external balance.
It would also lead to broader economic-policy coordination, particularly with respect to wage-setting, because governments would be compelled to use national legislation and public-sector wage settlements to influence wage policy in such a way that imbalances among euro-zone countries are reduced.
Furthermore, an External Stability Pact would oblige governments to take into account the consequences for other member states when designing national economic reforms.
If a “surplus country” such as Germany wanted to lower non-wage labor costs and increase value-added tax in order to boost its competitiveness, it would simultaneously have to adopt an expansive fiscal policy to compensate for the negative effects on its partners’ foreign trade.
Within the framework of these rules, individual countries would retain the authority to design their policies.
The Spanish government, for example, could have met Spain’s building boom and foreign-trade deficit with tax increases or by urging domestic wage restraint.
Alternatively, it could have intervened by instituting planning regulations or imposing limits on mortgage loans.
An External Stability Pact would not only detect risks to fiscal stability early on; it would also help make a reality of a fundamental principle of EU law, namely that member states finally treat economic policy as a “common interest.”

Brazil’s Statute of Virtual Liberty
RIO DE JANEIRO – It seems like the plot of a horror movie – the type where a little-noticed glitch in the matrix threatens to cause global chaos.
This time, it was a simple, but fateful, programming misstep that suddenly left millions of consumers’ most sensitive information vulnerable to hackers.
News headlines screamed about online dangers that we could barely understand, alerting swarms of digital pirates to a bounty of new criminal opportunities.
Companies worldwide scrambled to secure their online safety.
The story of the so-called “Heartbleed” bug, however, is all too real.
It points to a stark truth: In a shockingly short time, we have become completely dependent on the Internet, a frontier we are only beginning to comprehend, let alone map and regulate.
Important debates – such as freedom versus security, privacy versus piracy, and cyberspace’s impact on democracy – are far from being resolved.
Yet fears over Heartbleed and similar such threats, and the furor surrounding the aggressive American surveillance tactics revealed by former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden, have already put many countries in a defensive posture.
In many places, efforts to protect Internet freedom have been stymied.
But, as my home country, Brazil, has shown, a different path is possible.
Brazil’s House of Representatives has passed a genuine Internet “Bill of Rights,” which was unanimously approved by the senate and signed into law by President Dilma Rousseff last week – much to the delight of civil-society advocates.
The legislation, widely described as an Internet constitution, seeks to safeguard online freedom of expression and limit government collection and usage of Internet users’ metadata.
The bill ensures “net neutrality” (meaning that Internet service providers must treat all information and users equally), and subjects global companies, such as Google and Facebook, to Brazilian law and precedent in cases involving its own citizens.
Inspiration for Brazil’s embrace of Internet freedom stemmed in part from US President Barack Obama’s historic election campaign in 2008.
By tapping millions of small donations through social networking sites, he revolutionized election fundraising and seemed to open up new horizons for democracy and civic engagement.
But not everyone was convinced.
A wave of legislation – criminalizing various types of Internet use, such as music sharing, and allowing greater government surveillance – appeared to be turning back the liberal tide.
In Brazil, too, the authorities acquired greater control over the Internet, as the country moved to the forefront of the international fight against cybercrime.
The situation started to change in 2009, after Brazil’s then-president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, participated in an Internet freedom event, and vowed afterwards to block any legislation restricting online freedoms.
He also pledged to submit the bill that resulted in the newly adopted law.
Interestingly, the bill was not drafted by the usual cast of bureaucrats.
Instead, the process was opened up to the public, with ordinary citizens allowed to contribute via a government blog.
Advocates of free software mixed it up with law enforcers and lobbyists from the likes of Google and Yahoo, in a pioneering example of “wiki-democracy.”
In 2011, after two years of debate and discussion, a draft bill was sent to Congress.
Opposition was fierce.
Lobbyists sought to water down the proposed legislation, with telecommunications companies particularly opposed to its net-neutrality provisions.
Nevertheless, the coalition of forces backing the bill – civil-society groups supported by a 350,000-strong petition organized by legendary Brazilian musician and former Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil – overcame traditional political interests.
In the process, they seem to have ushered in a new model of lawmaking.
Elsewhere in the world, however, developments have moved in a different direction.
Obama’s electoral afterglow dimmed.
The Internet-inspired uprisings in Iran and then in much of the Arab world were brutally crushed.
New revelations about government surveillance, together with Heartbleed-type security scares, continue to test the world’s faith in online freedom.
Yet, despite the fears – and the dangers inherent in a free Internet – the world must not give up exploring the transformative potential of cyberspace.
Those who are losing their resolve need to only look south, where Brazil is leading the way.

Climate Change Is Making Us Sick
SAN DIEGO – A day before the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) began, a group of global experts convened by The Lancet published a report about the adverse health effects of climate change.
Their conclusion was as jarring as it was straightforward: human health is at the mercy of fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, health remained at the bottom of the priority list at COP27.
To be sure, some important health-focused conversations took place at the World Health Organization’s side pavilion.
These discussions were particularly timely, given the current surge of COVID-19, fueled by the newest Omicron subvariants, in Europe and the United States.
But, beyond a blink-and-you-miss-it mention in the preamble, the COP27 declaration makes no substantive mention of the climate-health nexus.
It is a glaring omission.
The connection between climate and health is deep and multifaceted.
Consider, for example, how warming temperatures and unprecedented flooding have encouraged the spread of mosquitoes – carriers of diseases like dengue fever, malaria, and the Zika virus – well beyond their traditional breeding grounds.
If nothing is done, Zika will threaten an additional 1.3 billion people by 2050, and dengue fever will affect a whopping 60% of the world’s population by 2080.
Similarly, climate-driven migration and shrinking animal habitats increase the risk that viruses and bacteria will jump from animal hosts to humans – just as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, likely did.
This makes another pandemic increasingly likely.
Global warming is also worsening air pollution and, in turn, chronic non-communicable diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Arvind Kumar, who founded the Lung Care Foundation in Delhi, laments that practically everyone in India has the health profile of a smoker, simply because of air pollution.
In fact, nearly 1.7 million Indians die every year from its effects.
The people most affected by these climate-related health issues have often done the least to create them.
Many residents of Bangladesh, Mozambique, and Pakistan do not even own cars.
Yet they are suffering from the floods, cyclones, and rising sea levels that have resulted from developed-country emissions.
Fortunately, key lessons from the pandemic response can help us tackle the health challenges that climate change raises.
For starters, we need a revolution in data collection and analysis.
Global systems to capture and share relevant data progressed significantly during the pandemic, but we are still using only a small share of the information generated.
Worse, the data tend to be divided into siloes.
To get a more complete picture of the health effects of climate change, we must integrate clinical, epidemiological, and genomic data from health systems with diverse non-health data, including on weather patterns, wastewater surveillance, consumer behavior, and even social media and mobility.
New open-source platforms like Global.health are an important step in the right direction, but much more must be done.
Another lesson from the pandemic is that, to avoid slipping back into the cycle of panic and neglect, any resilience agenda requires sustainable financing.
When COVID-19 emerged, scores of global actors – particularly in the arena of vaccines research – acted with unprecedented speed and coordination.
But while large amounts of funding supported short-term initiatives, not nearly enough investment has been channeled subsequently toward pandemic prevention and preparedness.
Likewise, while governments have responded to some of the immediate dramatic effects of climate change, such as natural disasters, interventions to address the climate crisis remain meager.
As a first step, world leaders should back the Bridgetown Agenda, which seeks to reform global finance for the twenty-first century, including by ensuring that it supports climate action and pandemic prevention.
They should also take every opportunity to connect climate and health issues in international forums, including at this month’s UN Biodiversity Conference in Montreal.
A final critical lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is that an effective response depends on community trust and engagement.
As with face masks and vaccines, community-based organizations and civil society will play a pivotal role in determining whether there is broad public buy-in for a bold agenda that covers both climate and health.
This will require a comprehensive, policy-shaping discussion that establishes a common language and shared intentions across sectors.
Where should we aim to prevent the health consequences associated with climate change, and where should we mitigate them?
Where should we adapt to the health effects of a warming planet, and why is an adaptation agenda becoming increasingly urgent?
In October, the UN confirmed that the world is far from meeting the goal, established in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and we may instead be headed to a catastrophic 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
As the United Kingdom’s COP27 representative Alok Sharma noted after the conference, the 1.5°C goal is now on “life support.”
Concerted action must be taken to revive it – and that starts with recognizing that climate and health are part of the same conversation.
They can and must be tackled together.

Reckoning with American Democracy’s Enemies Within
WASHINGTON, DC – With Donald Trump and the Republican establishment refusing to accept defeat in the face of a clear election result, democracy in the United States is under unprecedented attack.
If Americans had confidence in their democratic institutions, there would be little reason for concern. Trump’s behavior could be dismissed as a temper tantrum, and that of Republican leaders as a cynical exercise in humoring a narcissist adored by their party’s voters.
Yet Trump’s machinations, and GOP leaders’ complicity in them, cannot be dismissed so easily.
Deep anxiety is justified, because the political threat stems not from the misbehavior of a single person or his cronies, but from the realization that even a well-established democracy is defenseless against nihilism.
Democracy rests on certain principles that are now under relentless attack in the US. Facts are routinely proclaimed “fake” and supplanted by “alternative facts.”
Courts are being mobilized not to consider evidence of wrongdoing, but to obstruct, or to maintain a politically advantageous narrative. Institutional checks and balances have been used to turn Congress into a theater for high-pitched inaction.
The judicial appointment process has been blatantly politicized. The most basic principles of constitutional democracy have been abandoned.
Under these conditions, striving for governance “of the people, by the people, for the people,” as President Abraham Lincoln famously put it, becomes demonstrably pointless.
When the implicit norms underpinning democratic self-governance have all been destroyed, there is hardly anything left to defend.
Perhaps the US Constitution’s advanced age has brought us to this point, because any update through the formal amendment process has become impossible.
Perhaps independent institutions like the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve have become too powerful in the face of a Congress that has incapacitated itself.
Even so, history suggests that this may be only part of the story.
Germany’s Weimar Republic (1919-1933) did not fail because of the age of its constitution, but because, like in the US, the constitution’s own tools (namely, its emergency powers) could so easily be used against it.
While unrestricted proportional voting rules ensured broad representation in the Weimar parliament, they also produced party fragmentation and political ineffectiveness.
With elected authorities incapable of addressing the country’s urgent needs, anti-democrats happily labeled the parliament a “twaddle shack” (Schwatzbude) and moved to seize power for themselves.
After the Weimar Republic’s collapse, the depravations of Hitler’s regime, the horrors of the Holocaust, and the devastation of another world war, West Germany sought to rebuild its constitutional order as a fortified democracy (streitbare Demokratie) capable of defending itself against enemies from within.
The new Bundesrepublik enshrined human dignity as its core value, and declared sacrosanct the principles of democracy, federalism, the rule of law, and the division of power.
In theory, no amendment – not even a unanimous vote to amend the constitution – can touch these institutions.
But, of course, matters are more complicated in practice, because drawing clear lines is never easy in the open-ended language of constitutional law.
In fact, there simply is no institutional device that cannot be turned into a tool against the very norms and principles it is supposed to protect.
Equally problematic, historical lessons rarely endure.
After all, the European Union is also currently being attacked from within. The governments of Poland and Hungary – countries that emerged from authoritarian rule not too long ago – are blocking the EU’s €750 billion ($890 billion) recovery fund that is meant to mitigate the long-term economic damage wrought by COVID-19.
Their motive is not budgetary prudence, but rather retaliation for the EU’s efforts to make its funding conditional on compliance with the rule of law.
Absent a compromise, the EU will have to accept inaction or find a solution outside the EU treaty framework.
Such maneuvers would not be illegal, but they would violate the spirit of a union governed by consensus, and thus would smack of hypocrisy.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Poland’s de facto leader, Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, would be quick to point this out.
These two aspiring authoritarians are following the same script as congressional Republicans, who have refused to adopt another pandemic-relief package even though the previous one has largely run its course.
In each case, anti-democratic forces representing a minority are holding hostage millions of households and businesses in dire need of support – and for no reason other than obstruction or personal gain.
In responding to strategic actors who are willing to use the constitution to subvert constitutionalism, principled arguments don’t help, because one cannot shame the shameless. This implies a fundamental dilemma.
Acceding to their demands is a slippery slope that might well end with the collapse of the democratic order. Yet failing to compromise will harm the people whom government is supposed to serve, potentially driving them into the arms of the nihilists (who doubtless hope for, if not intend, that outcome).
Still, appeasement is the worst response of all. Too often, politicians who come to power in democracies have turned a blind eye to their predecessors’ transgressions, hoping that one can craft a better future only by letting bygones be bygones.
Yet without a reckoning for past deeds committed against the system itself, democratic constitutionalism eventually will crumble.
That is why we cannot simply move on from the Republican Party’s attempt to undermine the credibility of the election – the ultimate mechanism of democratic accountability.
Indeed, America’s failures to address past injustices – including the subjugation of indigenous peoples, slavery, racism, and the deprivations of the poor, immigrants, and the incarcerated – helps to explain why trust in democratic institutions has been so corroded in the first place.
Having been made brittle, America’s institutions have long been vulnerable to attack.
Trump and his helpers may not succeed in destroying democracy this time around; but if they are not held accountable, they will have plenty of opportunities to try again.

The IMF Is Fueling an Argentine Crisis – Again
BUENOS AIRES – Argentina first needed to borrow from the International Monetary Fund back in 1958.
In the six decades since, the country has signed 22 agreements with the Fund.
Most were subsequently derailed or ended in failure.
Despite his pro-business credentials, Argentina’s current president, Mauricio Macri, has joined this parade of disappointment.
In little more than three years, his government has signed two agreements with the IMF.
And recent developments suggest that Argentina’s troubled history with the Fund may be about to repeat itself.
The latest chapter began in June 2018, when the country was running fiscal and current-account deficits equivalent to a combined 11% of GDP.
Investors became wary of Argentine bonds, forcing the Macri government to rush to the Fund for help.
With the strong backing of the United States, Argentina was soon given a $50 billion IMF loan to use over the next three years.
The government pretended that this was just a “precautionary” program: Argentina would keep the money in its back pocket to reassure private investors.
Only two months later, however, Macri admitted that Argentina needed even more than $50 billion – and right away.
In IMF jargon, the deal had to be “front-loaded.”
At this point, Macri’s friendship with US President Donald Trump (they knew each other from the world of real estate) paid off.
The Fund agreed – albeit reluctantly – to top up the loan with an additional $7 billion, bringing it to $57 billion.
Moreover, about 90% of the full amount, or $51.2 billion, would be disbursed before Argentina’s next presidential election in late 2019.
This is the IMF’s largest-ever loan to a country, and Argentina’s ailing economy badly needs the financial support.
On April 15, the Fund sent a $9.6 billion installment.
But rather than using this money to build up its foreign-exchange reserves or buy back debt, the Macri government will instead buy Argentine pesos.
Unsurprisingly, Argentina’s risk premium has soared.
Investors are restless, and not only because former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is leading the polls.
They know that by front-loading the IMF’s financial support into his current term in office, Macri has also bunched Argentina’s future repayment obligations to the Fund.
And because the IMF has preferred-creditor status, it will be first in line to be repaid.
So if Argentina does not have enough dollars after 2020 to repay all its creditors, private investors could be forced to restructure their claims at a loss.
Investors therefore have a narrow window of opportunity to leave Argentina, and they may use it soon.
The government argues that the Treasury will need to sell the $9.6 billion in the domestic market to cover peso-denominated budgetary expenses.
Although borrowing dollars from the Fund to buy pesos seems unusual, the IMF has agreed.
At the same time, the government has been allowed to use the Fund’s money only in homeopathic doses of up to $60 million per day, through the central bank and in public auctions.
This makes no sense.
Under its IMF agreement, the government committed to running a zero-deficit primary budget balance (before interest payments), and to rolling over 70% of all maturities and interest payments on public debt in pesos.
The government is successfully meeting both conditions, and is currently rolling over 100% of interest and public debt maturing in pesos, exceeding this year’s target.
The government therefore has no budgetary need to use the IMF’s dollars to buy pesos.
Rather, the authorities – with the Fund’s endorsement – will use the money to keep the peso’s exchange rate stable until the elections later this year, thereby increasing Macri’s chances of re-election.
The IMF should not support this, for several reasons.
For starters, by endorsing such folly and false arguments, the IMF will jeopardize efforts (including by me) to normalize relations between Argentina and the Fund. Furthermore, the dollars that the government sells to prop up the peso this year will be badly needed by the next administration to service maturing debt and interest payments in 2020.
Having $9.6 billion – rather than the equivalent amount of depreciated pesos – would put the next government in a slightly more comfortable position if, as seems inevitable, it needs to renegotiate Argentina’s current IMF agreement.
And ensuring a stable peso may not even be possible, given that a daily auction of $60 million will not give the government enough ammunition to prevent spikes in the foreign-exchange market.
Finally, the more debt Argentina owes to a privileged creditor such as the IMF, the harder it will be to convince private, “non-privileged” investors to roll over their claims and continue financing the country in 2020 and thereafter.
Sadly, history may be about to repeat itself.
In October 2001, about 60 days before it defaulted on its debts, Argentina borrowed $8 billion from the Fund.
Most of this money was used to buy pesos from institutional investors leaving the country.
The IMF is about to make the same mistake again.
It should not expect a different outcome.

A Year of Successes in Global Health
BANGKOK – In the field of human development, the year that just ended was better than many predicted it would be.
A decade after the Great Recession began, economic recovery continued in 2017, and progress was made on issues like poverty, education, and global warming.
But perhaps the most significant achievements of the last 12 months were in global health.
I count 18 unique successes in 2017, many of which will help sow the seeds of progress for the months and years ahead.
The first notable success occurred early in the year, when a Guinness World Record was set for the most donations of medication made during a 24-hour period.
On January 30, more than 207 million drug doses were donated to treat neglected tropical diseases including guinea-worm disease, leprosy, and trachoma.
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and by pharmaceutical firms including Bayer, Novartis, Pfizer, and my company, Sanofi Pasteur.
India’s elimination of active trachoma was another milestone, as it marked an important turning point in the global fight against a leading infectious cause of blindness.
Last year, trachoma was also eliminated in Mexico, Cambodia, and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
A third key health trend in 2017 was further progress toward the elimination of human onchocerciasis, which causes blindness, impaired vision, and skin infections.
Fourth on my list is a dramatic drop in the number of guinea-worm disease infections.
A mere 26 cases were recorded worldwide in 2017, down from 3.5 million cases in 1986.
Efforts to eradicate leprosy earned the fifth spot on my list, while vaccine advances in general were sixth. Highlights included a new typhoid vaccine, shown to improve protection for infants and young children, and a new shingles vaccine.
Number seven is the dramatic progress made in eliminating measles.
Four countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom – were all declared measles-free last year.
The war on Zika is number eight on my list of health achievements in 2017.
Thanks to coordinated global efforts, most people in Latin America and the Caribbean are now immune to the mosquito-borne virus, and experts believe transmission will continue to slow.
Number nine is polio eradication.
Fewer than 20 new cases were reported globally, a 99% reduction since 1988.
Although the year ended with reports of cases in Pakistan, health experts remain optimistic that polio can be fully eradicated in 2018.
Rounding out my top ten was the creation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which was established to develop vaccines for infectious disease threats.
Launched with nearly $600 million in funding from Germany, Japan, Norway, the UK charity Wellcome Trust, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI aims to reduce sharply the time it takes to develop and produce vaccines.
Huge gains in disease control and prevention were made last year, and the next few items on my list (11 through 16) reflect progress on specific illnesses.
For example, rates of premature death fell for non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions.
Another highlight was the historic approval of a sophisticated cancer treatment, CAR T-cell therapy, which uses a patient’s own immune cells to attack tumors.
Improvements were also made in treating HIV.
Clinical trials for an HIV vaccine started at the end of 2017, while doctors in South Africa reported curing a young boy of the disease after he received treatments as an infant.
These and other initiatives give new hope to the many who are still suffering from this chronic condition.
Advances in treating gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted infection that has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, are also worthy of mention.
Wrapping up my list of disease-specific gains of 2017 is the renewed commitment made by global health ministers to eradicate tuberculosis by 2030.
The final two successes are reminders of how much work remains.
In August, the fast food giant McDonald’s unveiled a Global Vision for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Food Animals.
Although recognition of the food industry’s ethical responsibilities for public health is to be welcomed, the pledge also represents a cautionary note about how closely connected food and health really are.
Finally, rounding out my list was the historic Universal Health Coverage Forum held in Tokyo, where global leaders gathered to discuss how to improve health-care access.
The World Bank and the WHO note that half of the world’s population still cannot obtain essential health services.
I therefore count the December meeting as a “success” not for its achievements, but because it was a reminder to the international community that improving health-care access remains a long-term endeavor.
As the global health community resets its annual clock – and I begin cataloguing the big health stories of 2018 – we should take a moment to reflect on the 12 months recently ended.
Even in a mediocre year, the global health community saved millions of lives.
Imagine what we will achieve in an extraordinary year.

For Africa, Going Green Is Not a Luxury
CAPE TOWN – Earlier this year, Tropical Cyclone Idai tore through southern Africa, killing hundreds, injuring thousands, and displacing even more.
In Mozambique, as much as half of all annual crops and critical infrastructure were destroyed.
In total, over three million people in the region were affected.
It was a stark reminder of Africa’s vulnerability to the intensifying consequences of climate change.
Cyclones are nothing new, but as climate change progresses, they are becoming increasingly common: the Indian Ocean has an average of three cyclones per cyclone season; yet in this season alone, there were seven.
The same goes for other kinds of weather events.
In Zimbabwe, more than two million people are now facing an acute water shortage as a result of climate change-induced drought.
But even as Africa faces new challenges from climate change, it also has major opportunities to expand its economy and reduce still-pervasive poverty.
The combined GDP of African countries vulnerable to climate change is on track to rise from $2.45 trillion in 2019 to $3.46 trillion in 2024.
Can Africa secure this economic progress without contributing further to climate change?
The solution lies in a kind of Green New Deal – a comprehensive strategy for achieving sustainable growth, much like the one being championed by some Democratic politicians in the United States.
A pillar of such a plan would involve making large-scale investments in renewable-energy deployment.
Whereas an American Green New Deal would focus on shifting away from fossil fuels, the infrastructure for which is already in place, an African strategy would be delivering energy (and energy infrastructure) from scratch.
About 60% of the people worldwide who lack access to electricity live in Africa.
Yet in 2018, Africa received less than 15% of global energy investment.
And much of those limited funds are still going toward yesterday’s technologies.
Between 2014 and 2016, nearly 60% of Africa’s public investment in energy went to fossil fuels – $11.7 billion, on average, each year.
This approach is not only environmentally irresponsible; it also makes little economic sense.
Renewables are already outcompeting fossil fuels globally, and bold action on climate now promises to bring major economic benefits – to the tune of $26 trillion globally through 2030.
Given this, the European Investment Bank – a longstanding source of energy investment in Africa – should approve an existing proposal to halt all lending for fossil fuel-reliant energy projects by the end of 2020.
As for Africans, they are already promoting sustainable development.
The African Union’s Agenda 2063, created in 2013, set an ambitious blueprint for attaining sustainable and inclusive growth over the subsequent half-century.
The African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI), founded in 2015, focuses on drastically increasing the use of renewables, while expanding overall energy access.
On the ground, solar mini-grids are delivering cheap renewable energy to communities across Africa, increasingly at competitive prices (relative to comparably sized diesel-powered grids).
Solar home systems and clean-cooking solutions (which use cleaner, more modern equipment and fuels) are also providing cost-competitive clean energy access.
In East Africa, households equipped with solar systems saved an estimated $750 each on kerosene and eliminated 1.3 tons of carbon dioxide over the first four years of use.
What a Green New Deal must do is bring such innovations to scale, through coordinated public and private investment in wind- and solar-power generation – both on- and off-grid – and support for the deployment of clean-cooking solutions.
This should be integrated with broader efforts to foster green industrialization and entrepreneurship.
Substantial funding is already on offer.
Earlier this year, the World Bank announced plans to provide $22.5 billion for climate adaptation and mitigation in Africa for 2021-25.
The African Development Bank, for its part, recently invested $25 million in a renewable-energy equity fund that plans to add 533MW of installed energy-generation capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa.
This initial public investment is expected to mobilize an additional $60-75 million from private investors.
But, if a country hopes to be a recipient of that private investment, it must have strong energy planning and an effective regulatory regime, which is crucial to functioning clean-energy markets and the emergence of project pipelines.
That is why African countries must integrate climate action into all their economic and development planning.
To this end, a coalition of African countries, supported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the New Climate Economy, is working to facilitate meaningful, coordinated action that puts the entire continent on a more inclusive and sustainable growth path.
Partnerships with national finance and planning ministers, relevant development-finance institutions, and the private sector will support this process.
Overcoming the formidable challenge that climate change poses to Africa will depend on moments of collective focus and clarity.
The UN secretary-general’s climate summit next month should be just such a moment, with countries committing to step up their emissions-reduction targets under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, so as to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.
Given their heightened vulnerability, African countries have every incentive to set the bar high, thereby putting pressure on others to ramp up their own contributions.
Only with concerted global action will we have any hope of averting climate catastrophe.

From Brexit to the Future
NEW YORK – Digesting the full implications of the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum will take Britain, Europe, and the world a long time.
The most profound consequences will, of course, depend on the European Union’s response to the UK’s withdrawal.
Most people initially assumed that the EU would not “cut off its nose to spite its face”: after all, an amicable divorce seems to be in everyone’s interest.
But the divorce – as many do – could become messy.
The benefits of trade and economic integration between the UK and EU are mutual, and if the EU took seriously its belief that closer economic integration is better, its leaders would seek to ensure the closest ties possible under the circumstances.
But Jean-Claude Juncker, the architect of Luxembourg’s massive corporate tax avoidance schemes and now President of the European Commission, is taking a hard line: “Out means out,” he says.
That kneejerk reaction is perhaps understandable, given that Juncker may be remembered as the person who presided over the EU’s initial stage of dissolution.
He argues that, to deter other countries from leaving, the EU must be uncompromising, offering the UK little more than what it is guaranteed under World Trade Organization agreements.
In other words, Europe is not to be held together by its benefits, which far exceed the costs.
Economic prosperity, the sense of solidarity, and the pride of being a European are not enough, according to Juncker.
No, Europe is to be held together by threats, intimidation, and fear.
That position ignores a lesson seen in both the Brexit vote and America’s Republican Party primary: large portions of the population have not been doing well.
The neoliberal agenda of the last four decades may have been good for the top 1%, but not for the rest.
I had long predicted that this stagnation would eventually have political consequences.
That day is now upon us.
On both sides of the Atlantic, citizens are seizing upon trade agreements as a source of their woes.
While this is an over-simplification, it is understandable.
Today’s trade agreements are negotiated in secret, with corporate interests well represented, but ordinary citizens or workers completely shut out.
Not surprisingly, the results have been one-sided: workers’ bargaining position has been weakened further, compounding the effects of legislation undermining unions and employees’ rights.
While trade agreements played a role in creating this inequality, much else contributed to tilting the political balance toward capital.
Intellectual property rules, for example, have increased pharmaceutical companies’ power to raise prices.
But any increase in corporations’ market power is de facto a lowering of real wages – an increase in the inequality that has become a hallmark of most advanced countries today.
Across many sectors, industrial concentration is increasing – and so is market power.
The effects of stagnant and declining real wages have combined with those of austerity, threatening cutbacks in public services upon which so many middle- and low-income workers depend.
The resulting economic uncertainty for workers, when combined with migration, created a toxic brew.
Many refugees are victims of war and oppression to which the West contributed.
Providing help is a moral responsibility of all, but especially of the ex-colonial powers.
And yet, while many might deny it, an increase in the supply of low-skill labor leads – so long as there are normal downward-sloping demand curves – to lower equilibrium wages.
And when wages can’t or won’t be lowered, unemployment increases.
This is of most concern in countries where economic mismanagement has already led to a high level of overall unemployment.
Europe, especially the eurozone, has been badly mismanaged in recent decades, to the point that its average unemployment is in double digits.
Free migration within Europe means that countries that have done a better job at reducing unemployment will predictably end up with more than their fair share of refugees.
Workers in these countries bear the cost in depressed wages and higher unemployment, while employers benefit from cheaper labor.
The burden of refugees, no surprise, falls on those least able to bear it.
Of course, there is much talk about the net benefits of inward migration.
For a country providing a low level of guaranteed benefits – social protection, education, health care, and so forth – to all citizens, that may be the case.
But for countries that provide a decent social safety net, the opposite is true.
The result of all this downward pressure on wages and cutbacks in public services has been the evisceration of the middle class, with similar consequences on both sides of the Atlantic.
Middle- and working-class households haven’t received the benefits of economic growth.
They understand that banks had caused the 2008 crisis; but then they saw billions going to save the banks, and trivial amounts to save their homes and jobs.
With median real (inflation-adjusted) income for a full-time male worker in the US lower than it was four decades ago, an angry electorate should come as no surprise.
Politicians who promised change, moreover, didn’t deliver what was expected.
Ordinary citizens knew that the system was unfair, but they came to see it as even more rigged than they had imagined, losing what little trust they had left in establishment politicians’ capacity or will to correct it.
That, too, is understandable: the new politicians shared the outlook of those who had promised that globalization would benefit all.
But voting in anger does not solve problems, and it may bring about a political and economic situation that is even worse.
The same is true of responding to a vote in anger.
Letting bygones be bygones is a basic principle in economics.
On both sides of the English Channel, politics should now be directed at understanding how, in a democracy, the political establishment could have done so little to address the concerns of so many citizens.
Every EU government must now regard improving ordinary citizens’ wellbeing as its primary goal.
More neoliberal ideology won’t help.
And we should stop confusing ends with means: for example, free trade, if well managed, might bring greater shared prosperity; but if it is not well managed, it will lower the living standards of many – possibly a majority – of citizens.
There are alternatives to the current neoliberal arrangements that can create shared prosperity, just as there are alternatives – like US President Barack Obama’s proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal with the EU – that would cause much more harm.
The challenge today is to learn from the past, in order to embrace the former and avert the latter.

Obama versus Romney on Jobs
BERKELEY – The United States has just completed its third year of economic recovery, but the unemployment rate remains above 8%, and there are worrisome signs of a slowdown.
So it is no surprise that jobs have become a major focus in the presidential campaign – or that the candidates have very different ideas about how to boost employment.
Last autumn, President Barack Obama proposed the American Jobs Act, a $450 billion package of fiscal measures aimed at job creation.
The AJA amounted to about 3% of GDP and was designed to take effect in 2012, providing a timely employment boost and insurance for the US recovery against global headwinds.
Most of its measures had enjoyed bipartisan support in the past; tax cuts comprised about 56% of the total cost; and the package was paid for in Obama’s long-term deficit reduction plan.
Several independent economists concluded that Obama’s plan would provide a significant lift to the job market in 2012-2013.
Indeed, two of the nation’s most respected forecasters predicted that the AJA would add 1.3-1.9 million jobs in 2012 and more than two million jobs by the end of 2013.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also found that most of the AJA’s policies ranked high in budgetary effectiveness, measured by the number of jobs created in 2012-2013 per dollar of budgetary cost.
The AJA was filibustered by Senate Republicans, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives likewise prevented the bill from coming to a vote.
Mitt Romney, now the Republican presidential candidate, attacked the plan as “mere stimulus” that would “throw a cup of gasoline on the embers” of the recovery.
Ultimately, Obama, bolstered by polls endorsing his plan, won partial passage of two AJA policies: a one-third cut in employees’ payroll taxes (he had proposed one-half), and an extension of unemployment benefits by about 60% of what he had recommended.
But Congress failed to approve a 50% cut in employers’ payroll taxes – a business tax cut that many Republicans favored in the past and that ranks high on budgetary effectiveness.
Nor did Congress approve $30 billion in federal grants to states to enable them to employ about 135,000 teachers, police, and firemen, despite strong voter support.
Such grants between 2009 and 2011, totaling $130 billion, helped states to maintain vital services and retain the public employees providing them.
Romney opposes more federal money for the states, arguing that “it is time to cut back on government and help the American people.”
But teachers, firemen, and police are American people who help other American people.
Government employment is falling at the fastest rate since the 1940’s, and is now at its 2006 level.
If public employment had grown during the last three years at about the same rate as the population, as it did during George W. Bush’s presidency, the unemployment rate would be around 7% rather than 8.2%, owing to about 800,000 additional jobs.
Likewise, Congress failed to approve Obama’s call for $90 billion in additional infrastructure spending, which would have supported about 400,000 jobs, despite the fact that the US has at least $1.1 trillion in unfunded infrastructure needs.
Moreover, infrastructure investment not only creates jobs in the near term, but also promotes long-term competitiveness.
Altogether, Congress left at least one million jobs on the negotiating table, holding unemployed workers hostage to the outcome of November’s election.
Meanwhile, in response to persistent media pressure, Romney has unveiled his policies to boost short-term job creation.
They are not convincing.
Romney says that he would ensure that the US puts more people to work in the energy sector. But, while the oil and gas industry has grown significantly since 2007, it employs fewer than 200,000 people, implying a negligible effect even if employment in this sector doubled in the short run.
And, while Romney says that he would open new foreign markets, Obama has been doing just that, winning passage of three major trade agreements and increasing federal support for US exports, which have been growing nearly twice as fast as they did during the recovery from the 2001 recession.
Moreover, Romney’s promise to charge China, America’s third-largest export market, with currency manipulation, and to impose large tariffs on Chinese imports, would almost certainly invite retaliation, causing a decline in US exports and jobs.
Romney would also repeal “Obamacare” – the 2010 health-care reform legislation – because it “is scaring small business from hiring.”
But the evidence for this claim is meager and anecdotal. A recent survey found that most small businesses support the reform.
Most businesses, large and small, cite insufficient demand as the primary reason they are not hiring.
Nor is Romney’s promise to enact immediate cuts in federal discretionary spending by an additional 5% likely to boost job growth, as he asserts.
When an economy is suffering from high unemployment and weak aggregate demand, spending cuts are contractionary.
Romney conceded this point recently, acknowledging that the “fiscal cliff” – the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of this year, combined with large spending cuts already scheduled to take effect – would push the economy back into recession.
Finally, in addition to extending Bush’s tax cuts, Romney promises an across-the-board 20% reduction in marginal personal-income-tax rates and a significant cut in the corporate rate to encourage businesses to hire more workers.
Despite large cuts in marginal income-tax rates at the start of the Bush administration, however, job growth between 2000 and 2007 was half the rate of the previous three decades.
Even if Romney’s new tax cuts strengthened investment and growth in the long run (a debatable proposition that depends on how they are financed), their short-term effect on job creation would be minimal, and they would entail a significant loss of revenue.
Indeed, these cuts perform poorly on the CBO’s measure of budgetary effectiveness.
Obama’s proposals to boost job creation are convincing, whereas Romney’s proposals would have little or no effect – and some could even make matters worse.
Voters need to know the difference.

Geoengineering Climate Change
MALMÖ – Even climate activists increasingly recognize that the lofty rhetoric of the global agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, concluded in Paris just over a year ago, will not be matched by its promises’ actual impact on temperatures.
This should make us think about smart, alternative solutions.
But one such alternative, geoengineering, is a solution that many people refuse to entertain.
Geoengineering means deliberately manipulating the Earth’s climate.
It seems like something from science fiction.
But it makes sense to think of it as a prudent and affordable insurance policy.
Climate summit after climate summit has failed to affect global temperatures for a simple reason. Solar and wind power are still too expensive and inefficient to replace our reliance on fossil fuels.
The prevailing approach, embodied by the Paris climate agreement, requires governments to try to force immature, uncompetitive green technologies on the world.
That’s hugely expensive and inefficient.
The Bill Gates-led Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund announced last year provided reason for hope.
At the center of any response to global warming, we need to focus on making renewable energy cheaper and competitive through research and development.
Once innovation drives the price of green energy below that of fossil fuels, everyone will switch.
Much more research funding is needed.
But such innovation will take time.
That’s where geoengineering could play a role.
This year, for the first time, the US government office that oversees federally funded climate studies is formally recommending geoengineering research.
The move has the backing of President Barack Obama’s former science adviser John Holdren, who has said that geoengineering has “got to be looked at.”
Last year, 11 climate scientists declared that the Paris agreement had actually set back the fight against climate change, saying that, “Our backs are against the wall and we must now start the process of preparing for geoengineering.”
The crucial benefit of investigating geoengineering is that it offers the only way to reduce the global temperature quickly.
Any standard fossil-fuel-cutting policy will take decades to implement and a half-century to have any noticeable climate impact.
Geoengineering can literally reduce temperatures in a matter of hours and days.
That is why only geoengineering, not investments in renewables, can be an insurance policy.
Moreover, geoengineering promises to be exceptionally cheap, making it much more likely than expensive carbon cuts to be implemented.
This also means that it is more likely to be deployed by a single country or even a rogue billionaire.
Given this, it is essential that we seriously investigate its effects beforehand, to ensure that it works and doesn’t deliver unexpected, negative results.
To be clear, I am not advocating that we should start geoengineering today or even in this decade.
But it merits serious research, especially in view of the limitations of the Paris climate agreement.
So, what exactly should be studied?
Many methods of atmospheric engineering have been proposed.
The most talked-about process takes inspiration from nature.
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide was pumped into the stratosphere, reacting with water to form a hazy layer that spread around the globe.
By scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight, the haze cooled the Earth’s surface for almost two years.
We could mimic this effect through stratospheric aerosol insertion – essentially launching material like sulfur dioxide or soot into the stratosphere.
The most cost-effective and least invasive approach is probably a process called marine cloud whitening, whereby seawater droplets are sprayed into marine clouds to make them slightly whiter and reflect more sunlight.
This augments the naturally occurring process by which salt from the oceans provides the condensation particles for water vapor, creating and boosting the whiteness of clouds.
Research for the Copenhagen Consensus, the think tank I direct, has shown that spending just $9 billion on 1,900 seawater-spraying boats could prevent all of the global warming set to occur this century.
It would generate benefits – from preventing the entire temperature increase – worth about $20 trillion.
That is the equivalent of doing about $2,000 worth of good with every dollar spent.
To put this in context, the Paris climate agreement’s promises will cost more than $1 trillion annually and deliver carbon cuts worth much less – most likely every dollar spent will prevent climate damage worth a couple of cents.
People are understandably nervous about geoengineering.
But many of the risks have been overstated.
Marine cloud whitening, for example, amplifies a natural process and would not lead to permanent atmospheric changes – switching off the entire process would return the world to its previous state in a matter of days.
It could be used only when needed.
The case for serious research into geoengineering is compelling.
As a growing number of scientists are recognizing, the planet needs more opportunities to address global warming.
With a climate outcome as weak and costly as the one implied by the Paris agreement, such opportunities cannot arrive too soon.

The Beautiful Game’s Ugly Blemish
ANN ARBOR – The quality of refereeing at the World Cup had been a source of relief until June 18, when referee Koman Coulibaly of Mali disallowed a perfectly legitimate goal by the United States that would have given it an all-important win over Slovenia.
Worse still, Coulibaly never had to account for his terrible decision, or explain it to anyone – not the players and coaches on the pitch, and not the public at large.
Referee decisions in football, no matter how egregiously erroneous, are incontestable and immutable.
Football fans the world over will always remember the outrageous error that awarded France the decisive goal against Ireland to qualify for the tournament, despite obvious hand-play by the French superstar Thierry Henry.
We believe that a concerted effort to reform football (soccer) refereeing is urgently needed.
Refereeing errors increasingly mar the game on all its levels – country and club, major and minor leagues, globally televised tournaments and matches, and local games.
Since such errors have major implications for the outcome of key tournaments which define this most global of sports, their ubiquity and frequency jeopardize the game’s very integrity – and thus its essential legitimacy.
Such episodes, after all, are increasingly part of the public domain, owing to new media that have rendered the game even more global than it was.
What makes this issue so central to football’s future is that these errors do not result from referees’ negligence, inattentiveness, or incompetence.
Rather, they reflect the game’s speed, its players’ athleticism, the size of the playing surface, and a puzzling resistance by the game’s leading authorities to adapt nineteenth-century rules to twenty-first century resources.
First, there is a need for video evidence. This would literally furnish the game changer in those few key situations that decide a match, such as an unjustifiably denied goal, an erroneous red card, or an egregious offside call.
One could establish a sort of über-official who surveys video monitors, immediately overrules blatantly wrong calls, and directly communicates this decision with the referee and linesmen on the field (who are already equipped with earphones).
Alternatively, one could give each team the opportunity to challenge up to two referee decisions per game, employing video replays to review rules infractions and settle disputed calls.
This procedure would give the referees on the field the opportunity, if necessary, to overrule their initial decisions.
And quick reviews would not waste much time or interrupt the flow of the game.
Under current conditions, the berating of the referee by the slighted team’s players consumes more game time than any review ever will.
Second, we need to make use of the perfectly functioning electronic chip already inside the ball to settle decisively whether a ball has crossed the field’s boundaries or its all-important goal lines.
Consider how an essentially equivalent technology has successfully reduced line-related controversies in major tennis tournaments.
Third, serious consideration should be given to introducing a second referee, with each given responsibility for one half of the huge playing field.
After all, the US National Basketball Association employs three referees on a playing surface one-ninth the size of a football field.
Lastly, the culture of secrecy and non-accountability that permeates soccer’s major governing bodies such as FIFA, UEFA and the various country federations needs to be changed.
No other major team sport tolerates the arrogance of governing bodies who feel no responsibility to explain their actions.
These measures – and many others that include the overdue use of available technology – would augment the effectiveness of often-clueless referees, whose authority has declined sharply with the proliferation of decisive mistakes in major games and championships.
While none of these measures is new, implementing them would add significant clarity and fairness to football, and thus enhance the legitimacy of the game.
Above all, referees must be accountable for their decisions.
They must not be permitted to decide games of utmost importance in an arbitrary manner that need never be explained to anyone.
Many of these overdue reforms have long been promoted by leading football experts, such as the Dutch world-class striker Marco van Basten and the former FIFA referee Markus Merk of Germany.
A majority of football fans around the world also supports decisive reforms that easily minimize refereeing errors.
Like the Irish, many of them have become increasingly alienated by football’s old ruling regime and the conservative authorities that guard it.
Of course, we are fully aware that human error will never be eliminated from affecting outcomes in any sport.
Nor should it be.
Indeed, we actually believe that the “we wuz robbed” dimension of all sports adds to their lore and legend.
But those responsible for a global product on the scale of football surely must act boldly to minimize the most egregious and avoidable errors, and thereby preserve the game’s integrity.

Toward European Green Cohesion
BRUSSELS – Many of the European Union’s poorer members are in a double bind.
Though these countries are among those most exposed to the destructive effects of climate change, they also face greater risks from the shift to a green, zero-emission, digital economy.
To achieve a smooth and just transition, these countries will need investments geared toward their specific needs.
Historically, much of the public investment in the EU’s poorer countries has been in trade-related infrastructure such as highways and railways.
But these growth-enhancing investment strategies now need to evolve to help everyone manage the costs of the green transition, which will require new forms of infrastructure and measures to support workers in carbon-intensive industries.
For Europe to carry out its ambitious climate agenda, it must address the relative paucity of investment in sustainability in economically weaker regions.
That is why the European Investment Bank is rethinking its own “cohesion orientation,” as outlined in a new paper examining our investments in less-developed parts of the EU.
Our ambition is to raise the amount we lend in these regions to 45% of our total investments, and to expand our support to include all regions where GDP per capita is below the EU average.
Using public finance to draw the EU closer together is one of the EIB’s founding missions.
Over the course of the EU’s last seven-year budget period (2014-20), projects in cohesion regions accounted for 30% of EIB lending – a total of €120.8 billion ($139.6 billion), and those investments paid off handsomely.
Our internal models show that our lending in cohesion regions over this period will boost growth by at least half a percentage point and employment by at least two-tenths of a percentage point each year for the next 30 years.
I have seen the positive effects of EU cohesion policies firsthand through my previous experience as Bulgaria’s minister of regional development and head of the managing authority for regional development.
Financial instruments like EIB loans, guarantees, equity investments, advisory services, and partnerships have materially accelerated investment, including by crowding in private capital.
Now, these instruments will complement the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility and Just Transition Mechanism.
Although the EU’s less-developed regions are mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, parts of Portugal, Greece, and the southern regions of Italy and Spain have long histories of low growth and are also still catching up.
Moreover, many formerly wealthy industrial regions are struggling to cope with globalization and technological change.
In the EIB’s new approach, cohesion regions (with GDP per capita below 75% of the EU average) will receive up to 23% of our total EU lending by 2025.
But the European Commission has also identified “transition regions” with incomes around 75-100% of the EU average as a new vulnerable group.
These regions – which can be found in countries ranging from France and Spain to Finland and the Netherlands – will need targeted support to deal with challenges such as dependence on low-tech manufacturing, rising unit labor costs, relatively low educational attainment, and declining industrial employment.
Fortunately, there need not be any contradiction between cohesion and ambitious climate goals.
In fact, the two go hand in hand, because a failure to ensure that no one is left behind will almost certainly derail the climate agenda.
But to make this case to the public, we must emphasize a longer-term perspective, reminding people that the costs associated with the green transition will be but a fraction of the catastrophic costs we will face if we fail to address climate change.
The power of this economic logic is why we at the EIB are confident that we can increase our lending to cohesion regions and expand the green share of our loan portfolio to 50% by 2025.
The key is to target support carefully, identifying projects that serve both objectives.
There is no shortage of investment opportunities in clean mobility, energy efficiency, renewable energy, water and wastewater management, and the industries at the center of any circular economy, not least food and agriculture.
In Europe, at least, the potential disruption to jobs and industries from the digital transition is often overshadowed by the decarbonization debate.
But the structural gaps in digital activity and innovation between cohesion regions and the rest of Europe are significant.
According to the EIB’s 2020 Investment Survey, 63% of firms in Europe’s less-developed regions were not engaged in any “innovation activities.”
And even among large firms, the proportion of those pursuing innovation was significantly lower than elsewhere in Europe (39% compared to 52%).
New policies are needed to help these regions spur innovation, raise income levels, and adjust to the digital age.
As part of our new approach to cohesion, we plan to tackle this problem by helping mid-cap companies in less-developed regions adopt proven technologies, conduct research and development, and access financing (including by lending to them directly or through intermediated programs).
Mid-cap companies are particularly important, because research shows that they have strong positive effects in their communities.
Ultimately, the purpose is not just to help cohesion regions.
It is to bring Europeans closer together and strengthen the unity that underpins the EU.

The Missing Arrow of Abenomics
TOKYO – In his drive to kick-start the Japanese economy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, shortly after taking office in 2012, introduced a large fiscal stimulus and put in place a bold program of monetary easing.
Since then, Japanese policymakers have been working to launch what Abe calls the third “arrow” of his agenda: arduous reforms of key industries and the demolition of structural barriers to growth.
But the focus on public policy has left a “fourth arrow” – the private sector – untouched and seemingly ignored.
This is unfortunate, because the government cannot fix Japan’s ills on its own.
Annual productivity growth has been stubbornly sluggish, rarely rising above 2% for much of the past two decades, reflecting both missed opportunities and declining cost competitiveness.
Japan’s productivity slump permeates the entire economy; labor and capital productivity gains have nearly stalled in almost every sector – even in Japan’s signature advanced manufacturing industries.
Labor productivity in the transport-equipment sector, for example, is barely half that of Germany.
This trend puts annual GDP growth on course to average only 1.3% through 2025, implying a third consecutive decade of stagnation.
Such an outcome would coincide with – and exacerbate the effects of – an adverse demographic shift that will constrain fiscal revenues and drive up costs for universal health care and pension benefits.
Japan’s ability to alter its trajectory depends on individual companies making decisions to invest, change workplace policies, deploy new technologies, and test untried business models.
Abe’s structural reforms will take time and political will to enact, but Japanese companies cannot afford to sit still.
They can and must act, without waiting for the government to change its policies.
In many cases, the economy’s bottlenecks are not regulatory in nature, but stem from entrenched ways of doing business.
New research by the McKinsey Global Institute examines Japan’s advanced manufacturing, retail, financial services, and health-care industries in detail – and finds substantial untapped productivity potential in every area.
For starters, Japanese firms must become more globally integrated.
Exporting to the fastest-growing overseas markets is one obvious route to overcoming sluggish demand growth at home. But, rather than just selling products abroad, Japanese enterprises need to expand operations beyond their borders and cast a wider net for international talent.
Japanese companies have formidable R&D operations, but most will need to reconfigure them to obtain better returns and impact.
The process must start with an understanding of what the customer wants and a determination to deliver solutions accordingly.
Closed and tightly managed R&D operations must be transformed into more fluid, open processes involving collaboration with customers and suppliers.
Japanese companies will also need to improve their capabilities in areas such as marketing, pricing, and talent development.
While there are some pockets of excellence, most Japanese firms are severely lacking in these areas.
To compete in global markets, they will need to achieve the same consistency in these areas that they have in their traditional areas of strength.
Many Japanese companies have yet to digitize paper-based processes and replace outdated information-technology systems.
Others would benefit from moving beyond basic digitization to next-generation technologies, such as big-data analytics.
Companies can also head off looming labor shortages with intelligent software systems and robotics.
Manufacturers can augment or replace their assembly lines with technologies such as the Internet of Things and 3D printing.
More broadly, Japanese companies have to organize for performance and discipline.
As policy changes unleash market forces, businesses will face greater competition.
Some may need to reorganize or exit unprofitable markets; others may have to undertake mergers and acquisitions to achieve economies of scale.
Finally, shareholders and senior executives should tie performance goals to incentives.
Some of Japan’s corporate giants have already begun shifting from traditional seniority-based advancement toward merit-based pay structures.
Others should follow their lead.
Promoting younger and more diverse talent can create agile organizations with fresh ideas.
If Japan’s private sector rises to the challenge, it can move the economy onto a path of faster growth.
Innovations in one company would cascade across its entire industry by forcing competitors to raise their game.
In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, Toyota introduced more efficient production processes that were eventually adopted by the entire automobile industry.
Instead of settling for a future of 1.3% annual GDP growth, Japan could attain roughly 3% annual growth through 2025.
Doing so would require the growth rate of labor productivity to more than double, but this is an attainable goal.
More than half of this growth increment can be met by adopting best practices that companies around the world already use, while technology can close much of the remaining gap.
Japanese business leaders need to combine big thinking with a focused attention to detail.
They will need to create innovative products, penetrate new markets, and make bold investments in equipment, technology, and talent, while simultaneously scrutinizing every aspect of their operations for inefficiency and waste.
Traditional ways of doing business may have to be abandoned. But there is ample scope to make progress and spur faster economic growth.
Immense trade flows, the rise of billions of new consumers in the emerging world, and technology breakthroughs are rapidly transforming the global economy.
Japan can shift its current trajectory by turning this wave of disruption into opportunity.

Ukraine and the Crisis of International Law
NEW YORK – Russia’s actions in Ukraine constitute a serious and dangerous violation of international law.
In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for a solemn commitment by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia to protect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Russia has now violated that pledge, not only harming Ukraine but also undermining the international legal framework for preventing nuclear proliferation.
Unless Russia changes course – which seems unlikely anytime soon – the global consequences are apt to be grave.
The US and the European Union will impose sanctions, weakening Russia’s economy and the world economy – and stoking even more tension and nationalism.
Mistakes on one side or the other could lead to violent disaster.
We need only to recall the spiral of hubris and miscalculation that led to the outbreak of World War I, a century ago this year.
As frightening as the Ukraine crisis is, the more general disregard of international law in recent years must not be overlooked.
Without diminishing the seriousness of Russia’s recent actions, we should note that they come in the context of repeated violations of international law by the US, the EU, and NATO.
Every such violation undermines the fragile edifice of international law, and risks throwing the world into a lawless war of all against all.
The US and its allies have also launched a series of military interventions in recent years in contravention of the United Nations Charter and without the support of the UN Security Council.
The US-led NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 lacked the sanction of international law, and occurred despite the strong objections of Russia, a Serbian ally.
Kosovo’s subsequent declaration of independence from Serbia, recognized by the US and most EU members, is a precedent that Russia eagerly cites for its actions in Crimea.
The ironies are obvious.
The Kosovo War was followed by the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which occurred without the support of the Security Council, and in the case of Iraq, despite vigorous objections within it.
The results for both Afghanistan and Iraq have been utterly devastating.
NATO’s actions in Libya in 2011 to topple Muammar el-Qaddafi constituted another such violation of international law.
After the Security Council approved a resolution to institute a no-fly zone and take other actions ostensibly to protect Libyan civilians, NATO used the resolution as a pretext to overthrow Qaddafi’s regime through aerial bombardment.
Russia and China strenuously objected, stating then and now that NATO seriously exceeded its mandate.
Libya remains unstable and violent, without an effective national government, to this day.
As Russia itself has repeatedly pointed out, US actions in Syria have been similarly illegal.
When the Arab Spring protests began in early 2011, peaceful demonstrators in Syria demanded reforms. President Bashar al-Assad’s regime cracked down violently on the protesters, leading some military units to revolt.
At that point, in the summer of 2011, the US began to back the military insurrection, with President Barack Obama declaring that Assad must “step aside.”
Since then, the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others have provided logistical, financial, and military support to the insurrection, in violation of Syria’s sovereignty and international law.
There is no doubt that Assad has behaved cruelly, but there is also no doubt that the US-led support of the insurrection is a violation of Syria’s sovereignty, one that has contributed to an upward spiral of violence that by now has claimed more than 130,000 Syrian lives and destroyed much of the country’s cultural heritage and infrastructure.
One can add many other US actions, including drone strikes on the territory of sovereign states without their governments’ permission; covert military operations; renditions and torture of terror suspects; and massive spying by the US National Security Agency.
When challenged by other countries or UN organizations, the US has brushed aside their objections.
International law itself is at a crossroads.
The US, Russia, the EU, and NATO cite it when it is to their advantage and disregard it when they deem it a nuisance.
Again, this is not to justify Russia’s unacceptable actions; rather, it is to add them to the sequence of actions contrary to international law.
The same problems may soon spill over into Asia.
Until recently, China, Japan, and others in Asia have staunchly defended the requirement that the Security Council approve any outside military intervention in sovereign states.
Recently, however, several countries in East Asia have become locked in a spiral of claims and counterclaims regarding borders, shipping lanes, and territorial rights. So far, these disputes have remained basically peaceful, but tensions are rising.
We must hope that the countries of the region continue to see the great value of international law as a bulwark of sovereignty, and act accordingly.
There have long been skeptics of international law – those who believe that it can never prevail over the national interests of major powers, and that maintaining a balance of power among competitors is all that really can be done to keep the peace.
From this perspective, Russia’s actions in the Crimea are simply the actions of a great power asserting its prerogatives.
Yet such a world is profoundly and unnecessarily dangerous.
We have learned time and again that there is no such thing as a true “balance of power.”
There are always imbalances and destabilizing power shifts.
Without some scaffolding of law, open conflict is all too likely.
This is especially true today, as countries jostle for oil and other vital resources.
It is no coincidence that most of the deadly wars of recent years have taken place in regions rich in valuable and contested natural resources.
As we look back in this centennial year toward the outbreak of WWI, we see again and again that the only possible route to safety is international law, upheld by the United Nations and respected on all sides.
Yes, it sounds naive, but no one has to look back to see the naiveté of the belief that great-power politics will preserve peace and ensure humanity’s survival.
In the Ukraine crisis, the Security Council should help to find a negotiated solution that preserves Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
That will not happen soon, but the UN should persevere, looking for a breakthrough at a later date.
And, just as the US turns to the Security Council in this case, so it should hold itself accountable to international law as well, helping to build a bulwark against dangerous global instability.

Overcoming the COVID-19 Disruption to Essential Health Services
KIGALI – Health-care delivery in nearly every country has been disrupted by policymakers’ mistaken initial assumption that health systems would quickly win the fight against COVID-19.
As the pandemic’s caseload and death toll are increasing daily, it is often stalling or reversing hard-won progress on minimizing the impact of other diseases, from diabetes to malaria.
At the start of the pandemic, many policymakers and health leaders considered a relatively short disruption of essential health services acceptable, but it is now clear that COVID-19 will persist much longer than anticipated.
Countries can no longer postpone the delivery of crucial health services.
Without immediate action to ensure their continuity, the future death toll from communicable and non-communicable diseases will be unacceptably high.
In a grim recent assessment of the global costs of the COVID-19 crisis, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation reported that in 25 weeks, the pandemic had set the world back about 25 years in terms of vaccine coverage – a good proxy for how health systems are functioning overall.
Clearly, now is the time to make sure that essential health services are not left behind.
This will require dedicated funding, innovative approaches, and decentralized services to reach the world’s sickest and poorest communities.
Policymakers should reallocate funds in national budgets and form partnerships with private investors to marshal the necessary resources.
It is also crucial to establish domestic and global solidarity funds, similar to The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Creating such dedicated funds could help countries and multilateral institutions maintain the continuity of essential health services, thereby strengthening health-care systems and national economies in the long term.
Even before the pandemic, it was estimated that at least half of the world’s 7.8 billion people lacked access to essential health services.
Globally, six million children and adolescents, and 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns, die from preventable or treatable diseases annually.
COVID-19 has increased these numbers and eroded access to health care.
Global health experts have long been aware of the disruptions a protracted emergency would cause for health services.
In 2018, the World Health Organization defined an essential package of services that should be available without user fees during an extended crisis. These include maternal and neonatal health care as well as treatment for communicable and non-communicable diseases, mental health, and neglected tropical diseases.
Several challenges to delivering this package stand out. First, services for non-communicable diseases have decreased significantly.
Of the 155 countries surveyed by the WHO, 53% reported a partial or total disruption of treatment services for hypertension, 49% for diabetes, 42% for cancer, and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies.
HIV and tuberculosis (TB) testing and treatment is also being affected.
South Africa is among the countries most affected by these diseases. During the country’s lockdown, declines in TB testing led to a 33% decline in diagnoses.
The number of TB and HIV patients collecting their medications on schedule has also fallen. Weaker adherence will ultimately lead to an increase in drug resistance, therapeutic failure, and higher treatment costs.
And yet other countries, including Rwanda, New Zealand, and Taiwan, have demonstrated remarkable success in ensuring the continuity of essential health services.
In Taiwan, for example, low-cost universal health-care coverage has continued throughout the pandemic, and Rwanda has continued operating a new radiotherapy center for cancer treatment.
In Sierra Leone, where one in 17 mothers has a lifetime risk of death associated with childbirth, the Koidu Government Hospital in the Kono District is working with Partners In Health, a global nonprofit organization, on a mass communications campaign that reminds pregnant women to use maternity services. After a steep fall-off in prenatal visits, women are once more using these services.
Clinics in Sub-Saharan Africa are also innovating to continue the monitoring and treatment of the region’s 19 million diabetes patients during the pandemic.
The Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism of Cameroon, for example, developed ten “golden rules” for COVID-19 and diabetes management, including information on exercise during confinement.
Diabetes clinics have also introduced teleconsulting to limit the need for outpatient visits.
Furthermore, some countries are seeking innovative ways of ensuring care delivery.
For example, Rwanda is using drones to distribute medication to cancer patients and robots to monitor COVID-19 patients’ vital signs and prevent hospital-acquired infections.
Technological solutions may not always be cheap, but the gains can outweigh the financial outlay.
To achieve similar outcomes, many countries urgently need to overhaul their health-care allocation and delivery systems.
Where possible, COVID-19 testing and treatment centers should integrate the provision of essential health services, including screening for conditions such as high-risk pregnancies and chronic diseases.
Moreover, decentralizing health services could strengthen systemic readiness and limit disruption.
This will require training an expanded corps of community health workers, including heads of households, teachers, faith leaders, and traditional healers.
In Liberia, for example, trained community health assistants play a central role in the COVID-19 response, while still delivering essential services.
Clearly, the disruptions to health-care systems caused by COVID-19 can be overcome.
Crucially, countries need to reassess their delivery strategies and make targeted investments in essential health services.
Doing so will strengthen their resilience against similar health crises in the future.

The Right to Protest Is Under Siege
LONDON – Autocratic leaders often seek new ways to undermine the right to protest, because they know protesting can be an extraordinarily powerful force for political and social change.
Over the past decade, protests have toppled autocrats, forced governments and corporations to recognize the climate emergency, given a voice to workers suffering under unfair economic systems, and urged reforms to address police brutality and structural racism.
As Peter Mutasa – president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which has protested this year for better working conditions – has observed, protests are often the “only countervailing power and force” to repressive governments and the only way for marginalized people to gain access to public services.
And even in contexts where they have not yet achieved their goals, protests have shaken entrenched power structures.
In Belarus, for example, peaceful protests led by women (with the active involvement of broad sections of Belarusian society, including artists and trade unionists) have continued since August’s rigged presidential election.
In Thailand, protesters’ ongoing demonstrations for democratic reforms have highlighted a crucial debate about the monarchy’s constitutional role, which until recently was off-limits for public discussion.
And protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in May made structural racism a central issue in the US presidential election campaign.
But governments are employing ever more sophisticated and aggressive tactics to curtail people’s ability to protest.
This fundamental right is often threatened in four main ways.
First, governments are repurposing existing laws to limit protests and detain participants.
In India, police have arrested protesters under sedition and anti-terrorism laws, while officials in Hong Kong have cracked down on protests by deploying public-order laws (ostensibly to prevent the spread of COVID-19).
Other countries, including Algeria, Angola, Lebanon, and Thailand, have also used emergency anti-COVID measures to harass, intimidate, and jail protesters.
Such arrests and crackdowns occur despite the recognition of the right to peaceful assembly in many of these countries’ constitutions, as well as international law.
Second, some governments – most recently in Belarus and Nigeria – have tried to quash protests violently.
These governments not only disperse and detain protesters, but also torture and even kill them.
Third, governments have curtailed protesters’ ability to organize by ordering repeated Internet shutdowns.
The #KeepItOn coalition, convened by the digital-rights group Access Now, recorded at least 65 Internet shutdowns during protests in 2019, including in Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Algeria, India, and Indonesia.
The Belarusian government has also repeatedly shut down the Internet during this year’s protests.
Fourth, governments, non-state actors, and some media organizations have demonized and stigmatized protesters.
US President Donald Trump, for example, has called peaceful protesters rioters, looters, thugs, and anarchists.
Another way to delegitimize protesters is to cast doubt on their motives by referring to them, without evidence, as “paid protesters,” or by characterizing pro-democracy demonstrators as “anti-national” and environmental activists as “anti-development.”
Such narratives aim to diminish public support for protesters and justify government crackdowns.
Despite the threats posed by such tactics, there is hope.
A growing number of individuals and organizations worldwide are working to safeguard the right to protest.
Some groups – for example, the Right2Protest coalition in South Africa – operate non-stop telephone hotlines for those who intend to protest peacefully, providing information and advice on legal frameworks.
When protesters are arrested, these groups connect them with lawyers who work to ensure that they are granted bail and, if necessary, defend them (often pro bono) at their trials.
Other groups specialize in legal challenges to official policies and practices that infringe on the right to protest.
In Uganda, for example, a five-year litigation effort spearheaded by four civil-society organizations led to a major victory in March, with the Constitutional Courtstriking down part of a law allowing Ugandan police to prevent or stop public gatherings arbitrarily.
In September, Colombian civil-society groups won a sweeping judgment in the country’s Supreme Court that called for police reform and a gag order preventing public officials from openly demonizing peaceful protesters.
Ultimately, though, the best protection for protest movements and those who defend them is the opportunity for participants to be part of something larger than themselves.
“Solidarity is the engine that keeps us going,” says Mutasa.
Everyone – not only lawyers and NGOs – can play a part in upholding the right to peaceful protest.
Doctors and nurses can provide emergency first aid.
Teachers can educate their students about the right to peaceful protest and why it matters.
Telecom operators can disregard government orders to shut down the Internet during protests.
Media professionals and citizen journalists can provide a powerful counter-narrative to those seeking to demonize protesters.
And as individuals, we can all take to the streets or voice our dissent online.
Without such solidarity, the right to protest is always vulnerable.
And where that right is not upheld, few other rights are safe.

War, Debt, and Democracy
NEW YORK – As the United States takes up the decision to lift its self-imposed debt ceiling, we would do well to remember why America’s public debt is as large as it is, and how it matters.
With the rise of the Tea Party, Republicans may rail against raising the debt ceiling, but they are likely to back down in the end, because, among other things, debt-funded wars – say, in Afghanistan and Iraq – are easier to defend than pay-as-you-go wars that voters must finance up front with taxes.
Indeed, the looming US debate underscores a more general point: since time immemorial, war has been a double-edged sword.
Human societies have slaughtered and oppressed one another on the scale of Mother Nature’s worst scourges. But wars have also brought beneficial change, because mobilizing people for fighting also mobilizes them for politics.
History is replete with examples of war expanding the voice of those who provided the resources to fight.
Ancient Athens became a “democracy” – literally, government by the people – when Kleisthenes organized ordinary fisher folk and farmers into a mass rabble capable of defeating Sparta-backed oligarchs.
Their political freedom was secured by Athens’ reliance on labor-intensive naval warfare against the Persians and other enemies.
In Rome, the army’s sit-down strike in the fifth century B.C. opened politics to the lower classes.
Common warriors were, explicitly and famously, the decision makers among Norsemen and in Swiss Alpine cantons in the early Middle Ages.
Medieval European cavalries later put political power into the hands of the wealthy, who could afford to support horses and their groomsmen, but the return of mass armies in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries often turned the tables.
Local militias achieved prominence and power in the Netherlands, beginning in 1568 during the long struggle against the Spanish Habsburgs, though they were again sidelined when the threat passed in the late seventeenth century.
Even then, European monarchs were forced to convene estates when they needed money to fight, forcing a dialog about the purposes and costs of war.
And “revolutionary” war against Britain in the eighteenth century helped secure democratic principles in the US Constitution and encouraged a wider franchise.
Napoleon’s armies, unleashed by the French Revolution’s mass political awakening, set off paroxysms of counter-mobilization that fueled the European revolutions of 1830 and 1848.
Modern democracy, with its mix of universal suffrage and property rights, looks remarkably like a compromise born of centuries of military competition among constitutionally evolving states, according to which the general public supplies the manpower to fight and moneyed interests supply the capital to train and equip the troops.
As a result, democracies are likelier than non-democracies to win wars, because they mobilize their societies more fully, and because citizens, who bear the costs, have the electoral power to stop politicians from fighting wars that are reckless and unnecessary.
America’s extended conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, however, are different.
Together, they have already cost more than America’s long war in Vietnam, but they have not increased public vigilance or political accountability at home.
Indeed, the younger generation of Americans has greeted military action abroad with a yawn.
What accounts for the stark contrast between the mass protests against the Vietnam War and the muted public reaction to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq?
To some degree, fear of terrorism might shield US leaders from the need for accountability. But eight in ten Americans think that terrorist attacks are unlikely, and many voters believe that involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq will increase rather than limit America’s vulnerability to terrorism.
More likely, Americans take these wars lying down because the costs are not experienced by the average citizen.
For one thing, technology-intensive warfare substitutes machines for soldiers, reducing the number of American casualties.
Volunteer soldiers – including many non-citizens – and mercenary units for manpower reduce even further the reasons for voters to care.
Moreover, the US is paying for these wars with debt.
The government funded World War II partly with war bonds, but it also instituted the first general income tax in American history, increasing tax revenue from $8.7 billion in 1941 to $45 billion in 1945.
This would have been impossible for an unpopular war.
To finance today’s wars, by contrast, the US government has not only avoided raising taxes, but has actually cut them on an enormous scale, with the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 now extended at least through 2012.
By 2009, the US budget deficit had climbed to more than 10% of GDP, thanks to increased expenditures and plummeting tax revenues during the recession.
Overall public debt, to which each year’s deficit adds another hefty dollop, is projected to exceed 100% of GDP in 2011, up from around 40% in the late 1970’s.
Countercyclical spending and tax policy are widely acceptable to experts and taxpayers alike, but deficit spending on wars is known to be a paltry way to stimulate the economy.
It does, however, buy political time for US administrations to continue prosecuting ill-considered and expensive wars with little domestic scrutiny.
With the US government’s access to global debt markets reducing the need to raise taxes, foreign governments now own nearly one-third of the US government’s $14 trillion debt.
We will not know for some time whether the US public debt is sustainable.
We do know, however, that until now governments have had to subject themselves to increased political oversight when they needed manpower or money to fight wars.
Lacking democracy’s most effective brakes on unpopular wars, the US has become relatively free to get itself mired in unwelcome foreign adventures.

The Turning Point of 2008
NEW YORK – Ten years ago this week, Russian tanks halted a few hours’ march short of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia.
That short war in the Caucasus brought down the curtain on nearly two decades of post-Cold War Western hegemony in Europe.
Encouraged by US President George W. Bush’s administration, Georgia had initiated NATO membership talks, impelling Russian President Vladimir Putin to defend the red line he had drawn the previous year.
Russia, Putin announced at the Munich Security Conference in February 2007, would regard any further eastward expansion of Western institutions as an act of aggression.
In August 2008, European diplomats scrambled to stop the fighting.
Within weeks, however, the onset of the global financial crisis captured the world’s attention.
In Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, and Moscow, preventing bank failures, not military escalation, was the most pressing problem.
At first glance, the Georgian war and the global financial crisis seem unrelated.
But this is to neglect the deeper currents driving the confrontation.
The absorption of post-communist Europe into the West was not simply a matter of velvet revolutions.
What Bush’s defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, called “new Europe” – the post-communist NATO allies and European Union members – depended on hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.
The loans came from the same European banks that helped fuel the US real-estate boom and inflate the even bigger housing bubbles in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain.
The most extreme real-estate inflation in the world between 2005 and 2007 was on NATO’s Eastern frontier in the Baltics.
Along with a security guarantee against Russia, the post-communist countries craved prosperity.
By the early 2000s, former Soviet republics like Georgia and Ukraine, which had not gained admission to either NATO or the EU, feared being left behind.
Their desire to “catch up” prompted the so-called color revolutions of 2003 and 2004, reflecting their belief that economic growth, democratization, and a pro-Western orientation went hand in hand.
But it was not only the Soviet Union’s former satellites that benefited from the debt-fueled global boom.
The authority and power of Putin’s regime, too, was (largely) a function of globalization – specifically, the huge surge in oil prices.
In 2008, it seemed that Russia’s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom, benefiting from unprecedented growth in emerging-markets demand, led by China, might soon become the world’s largest corporation.
In 2008, two pressure fronts of global capitalism were rushing toward each other across Eurasia.
While Western investment drove economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe, the commodity boom sustained Russia’s geopolitical revival.
Of course, these trends need not have led to a clash.
According to the mantra of globalization, at least, trade benefits all sides.
The EU insists on the innocence of its model of integration.
The goal is peace, stability, and the rule of law, not geopolitical advantage, its senior representatives guilelessly maintain.
Whether or not they truly believe it, the EU’s new post-communist members saw it differently.
For them, NATO and EU membership were part of an anti-Russian package, just as they had been for West European countries in the 1950s.
Whenever Germany pushed détente with Russia too far, tensions flared.
In response to the agreement in 2005 to construct the Nord Stream gas pipeline, Poland’s then-foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, denounced it as a new version of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Although Ukraine, too, applied for NATO membership in 2008, it did not provoke Russian intervention.
But the war in Georgia split the Ukrainian political class three ways, between those who favored alignment with the West, those who favored Russia, and those who preferred a policy of balance.
These tensions were further exacerbated by the impact of the financial crisis.
No part of the world economy was hit harder by that crisis than the former Soviet sphere.
When global lending imploded, the most fragile borrowers were cut off first.
Followed closely by a collapse in commodity prices, it dealt a devastating shock to the “transition economies.”
As one of the world’s largest oil and gas exporters, Russia was one of the worst affected.
But after the humiliation of the financial crises of the late 1990s, Putin had seen to it that Russia was armed with substantial dollar reserves – the third largest after China and Japan.
Reserves of $600 billion enabled Russia to ride out the storm of 2008 without external help.
The same was not true of its former satellites.
Their currencies plunged.
Interest rates soared.
Inflows of foreign capital stopped.
Some found themselves turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help.
In fact, the impact of the 2008 crisis split Central and Eastern Europe.
The political leadership of the Baltic states toughed it out, accepting savage austerity to continue on their path toward euro membership.
In Hungary, the governing parties were discredited, opening the door to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s illiberal regime.
But no country in the region was strategically more important, more fragile politically, or worse hit economically than Ukraine.
In a matter of weeks, Ukraine was dealt a devastating one-two punch by the war in Georgia and the financial crisis.
This opened the door to the successful presidential candidacy of pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych in 2010, and set in train desperate financial negotiations with the IMF, the EU, and Russia, culminating in the crisis of 2013.
Given current talk of trade wars, it bears recalling that it was an argument over Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU that led to Yanukovych’s overthrow and an undeclared war with Russia.
Back in 1989, the end of the Cold War seemed to suggest that market-driven economic growth was an irrepressible force that gave the edge to the US-led West.
It was a small step from there to assuming that extending capitalism to the post-Soviet world would continue to shift the balance of power in the West’s direction.
The events of August and September 2008 taught two painful and deeply disconcerting lessons.
First, capitalism is prone to disasters.
Second, global growth did not necessarily strengthen the unipolar order.
Truly comprehensive global growth breeds multipolarity, which, in the absence of an overarching diplomatic and geopolitical settlement, is a recipe for conflict.
Ten years later, the West is still struggling to come to terms with these disconcerting realizations.
Today all eyes are on Asia, the rise of China, and its growing influence across Eurasia, Africa, and Latin America.
But Putin’s Russia continues to be a spoiler.
So we should not forget the Georgian crisis of August 2008, when it first became obvious how dangerous the new global economic dispensation might become.

Supporting Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research
Most of the cells in our bodies have a short life span and a specific job to do.
Stem cells, found in many organs from skin to bone marrow, are different.
The “ancestors” of ordinary cells, they can replenish themselves indefinitely.
Given the right biochemical signals, these cells can divide and transform themselves into a range of different cell types as and when the need arises.
Such versatility means that stem cells have the potential to regenerate damaged organ tissues and provide amazing new treatments for a range of now devastating diseases.
Indeed, stem cells may perhaps make it possible for humans to “grow new organs” to replace diseased ones, thereby providing for the possibility of new forms of cell-based therapies.
On the basis of research with comparable cells from mice, scientists envision that stem cells could be used to replace bone marrow in patients suffering from cancer, produce pancreatic cells for alleviating diabetes, or neuronal cells for treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various brain and spinal cord disorders.
Stem cells used in this research are best derived from very early stage embryos created by in vitro fertilization, but this leads to ethical dilemmas.
The idea that human embryos could be created with the express purpose of “harvesting” them for medical purposes incites fear of a “brave new world” revisited.
Even if that extreme is unlikely, the possibility of abuse of any sort generates strong opposition.
Most of those who oppose stem cell research do not question its scientific and medical value, but object to the use of human embryos.
These critics, especially in Germany, where stem cell research evokes nightmares of Nazi era eugenics, argue that research with stem cells derived from embryos is unnecessary because multi-potential stem cells occur naturally in adult tissues as well.
While guardedly encouraged by recent reports of the remarkable plasticity of stem cells obtained from adult tissues, scientists know little about their potential for prolonged maintenance outside the body, their capacity for differentiation, and whether they can be obtained in the quantities needed to explore their utility for clinical use.
If embryonic stem cell research were to be halted based on that hope, it is possible that years may pass before scientists could determine if adult-derived stem cells are equivalent to embryonic stem cells in their potential to treat disease.
We cannot afford the luxury of proceeding with these promising technologies sequentially.
We owe it to those who are in need to explore all possible avenues that could lead to medical cures.
While research on adult-derived stem cells should be pursued aggressively, it should not be at the expense of an aggressive program to explore the full potential of stem cells for use in human therapies.
Another restriction has been recently adopted in the United States, where the issue was explored by the National Biomedical Ethics Advisory Commission in extensive hearings and discussions with ethicists, religious leaders, scientists and physicians.
They concluded that it is ethically permissible to prepare stem cell lines from frozen embryos, but only from those obtained in the course of in vitro fertilization procedures and deemed by donors and their physician to be in excess of clinical requirements. (More eggs are usually fertilized than are actually implanted in women who want to become pregnant.)
Following these discussions, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) promulgated guidelines that allow the use of government funds for stem-cell research but, in their present form, prohibit federally-funded investigators from creating new stem cell lines.
That restriction requires that stem cell lines must be obtained only from privately-funded or commercial sources that follow the protocols mandated by the guidelines.
I believe that restricting the use of government funds for the creation of stem cells, although politically prudent, imposes substantial scientific handicaps.
We know that a variety of poorly understood factors cause embryonic stem cells to lose their capacity to differentiate into all possible cell types.
This loss of capacity to differentiate may be caused by the particular mode in which the stem cells are derived, the conditions surrounding their growth, and other variables of handling.
Enabling individual government-funded investigators to derive stem cell lines using a variety of conditions in their own laboratories, as permitted recently in Britain and France, is the best route to determining what conditions are critical for generating cells for specific therapeutic purposes.
Embryonic stem cells prepared in a scientist’s own laboratory are most likely to have been derived, stored and maintained in ways that maximize their potency for particular uses.
Cells obtained from commercial sources are likely to be of unknown genetic background and history and therefore be less useful for some important studies.
While various remote contingencies are sometimes invoked, the fundamental ethical choice posed by stem cell research is more circumscribed: whether human embryos, which will ultimately be legally discarded, should be used to create potentially life-saving therapies for those in need.
Those who oppose abortion irrespective of its purpose argue that sacrificing a human embryo to obtain stem cells is akin to abortion and therefore immoral.
But harvesting stem cells from very early stage embryos that will in the end be discarded is, in my view, ethically distinct from abortion.
For we must also consider the moral consequences of failing to pursue this line of research if it has the potential to save and improve human lives.
What greater morality exists than doing all we can do to help individuals whose lives are blighted by disease and disability?

The Brexit Threat to British Security
LONDON – Some moments in history are steeped in irony.
To glimpse a current example, look no further than the United Kingdom.
As the Brexit negotiations with the European Union approach a tipping point – this month’s European Council meeting – the British government is seeking its scorned European partners’ help in its dispute with Russia over the attempted murder of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England.
But even before the brazen attack on the Skripals – targeted with the Soviet-designed nerve agent Novichok – Prime Minister Theresa May had become more forthright in highlighting the values and interests shared by the UK and the EU, including with regard to security and defense.
Indeed, at last month’s Munich Security Conference, she proposed a “deep and special partnership” on such matters.
In May’s preferred scenario, the UK would continue to participate fully in EU agencies like EUROPOL, while upholding European Arrest Warrants (EAWs).
Moreover, the UK would maintain its involvement in existing and future EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) missions, and coordinate with the EU on sanction regimes under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).
The attack on the Skripals has surely reinforced May’s interest in ensuring strong security cooperation after Brexit.
The kind of external threat that the attack represented is best addressed in cooperation with allies.
But can the UK’s allies take May seriously?
Those “who threaten our security,” she said in Munich, “would like nothing more than to see us fractured...and to see us put debates about mechanisms and means ahead of doing what is most practical and effective in keeping our people safe.”
Then, after reiterating that the UK had made a legitimate and democratic decision to leave the EU, she concluded that the ball is the EU’s court.
Not to accept her generous offer of close security cooperation would, in her words, amount to putting “political doctrine and ideology” first.
The irony of May’s stance has not been lost on the 27 EU states that the UK is leaving behind.
After all, by casting doubt on the unity of Europe – and, indeed, the entire West – Brexit itself is causing serious damage to European security, all for the sake of political doctrine and ideology.
To be sure, hardline Brexiteers like Trade Minister Liam Fox claim that the only external relationship the UK needs to buttress its security is NATO, led by the United States.
Yet while NATO will obviously remain the paramount source of security for all of Europe, no one should be willing to entrust their security to US President Donald Trump, who seems to have more contempt for allies than for adversaries like Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
As the intelligence chiefs of Britain, France, and Germany warned in a little-noticed joint statement released in Munich, any breakdown in security cooperation between the UK and the EU will have dire consequences.
But May cannot expect to maintain the UK’s current level of security cooperation with the EU, especially in the context of the otherwise “hard” Brexit she envisages.
When the UK departs from the EU, it will lose its right to shape the institutional frameworks that have long buttressed its security.
This leaves May with two choices: either she can leave those frameworks behind – a highly risky move – or she can accept, at least for the most part, the EU’s terms.
For example, the legal framework for security-related data must also cover commercial data.
If the UK can tolerate giving jurisdiction in this area to a European high court, as May’s Munich speech seems to suggest, why not in other areas?
The European Court of Justice has an impeccable reputation as an independent judicial body – one that has fairly defended the UK’s own interests many times.
Such an approach would generate significant goodwill in the negotiations. This, together with the UK’s considerable security-related assets and expertise, would create space for the country to carve out unique concessions from the EU, such as full-time observer status in the EU’s influential Political and Security Committee.
Whether or not such forms of cooperation – essential to ensuring security in both the UK and the EU – are realized, however, is far from certain.
Though May now seems to hold a more realistic view of the security risks Brexit poses, others in her party remain obstinate.
For example, Owen Paterson, a former Conservative cabinet minister, recently suggested doing away with the Good Friday Agreement, which has delivered two decades of peace to Northern Ireland – a highly reckless statement, given the political sensitivities that the Brexit vote triggered in Ireland.
Other Brexiteers, like Environment Minister Michael Gove, are also long-time skeptics of the Good Friday accords.
This suggests that, in the eyes of Brexit ideologues, security must take a back seat to their nationalist dreams.
Perhaps the recent attack on a former Russian agent in a quiet English country town will be enough to remove the ideological blinders from more Brexiteers, showing them that a “Britain alone” is a “Britain vulnerable.”
But it is also possible that by the time the UK’s citizens and leaders see Brexit from their allies’ perspective – as a selfish and destructive act of betrayal – it will be too late.

Why Central Bank Digital Currencies Will Destroy Cryptocurrencies
NEW YORK – The world’s central bankers have begun to discuss the idea of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and now even the International Monetary Fund and its managing director, Christine Lagarde, are talking openly about the pros and cons of the idea.
This conversation is past due.
Cash is being used less and less, and has nearly disappeared in countries such as Sweden and China.
At the same time, digital payment systems – PayPal, Venmo, and others in the West; Alipay and WeChat in China; M-Pesa in Kenya; Paytm in India – offer attractive alternatives to services once provided by traditional commercial banks.
Most of these fintech innovations are still connected to traditional banks, and none of them rely on cryptocurrencies or blockchain.
Likewise, if CBDCs are ever issued, they will have nothing to do with these over-hyped blockchain technologies.
Nonetheless, starry-eyed crypto-fanatics have seized on policymakers’ consideration of CBDCs as proof that even central banks need blockchain or crypto to enter the digital-currency game.
This is nonsense.
If anything, CBDCs would likely replace all private digital payment systems, regardless of whether they are connected to traditional bank accounts or cryptocurrencies.
As matters currently stand, only commercial banks have access to central banks’ balance sheets; and central banks’ reserves are already held as digital currencies.
That is why central banks are so efficient and cost-effective at mediating interbank payments and lending transactions.
Because individuals, corporations, and non-bank financial institutions do not enjoy the same access, they must rely on licensed commercial banks to process their transactions.
Bank deposits, then, are a form of private money that is used for transactions among non-bank private agents.
As a result, not even fully digital systems such as Alipay or Venmo can operate apart from the banking system.
By allowing any individual to make transactions through the central bank, CBDCs would upend this arrangement, alleviating the need for cash, traditional bank accounts, and even digital payment services.
Better yet, CBDCs would not have to rely on public “permission-less,” “trustless” distributed ledgers like those underpinning cryptocurrencies.
After all, central banks already have a centralized permissioned private non-distributed ledger that allows for payments and transactions to be facilitated safely and seamlessly.
No central banker in his or her right mind would ever swap out that sound system for one based on blockchain.
If a CBDC were to be issued, it would immediately displace cryptocurrencies, which are not scalable, cheap, secure, or actually decentralized.
Enthusiasts will argue that cryptocurrencies would remain attractive to those who wish to remain anonymous.
But, like private bank deposits today, CBDC transactions could also be made anonymous, with access to account-holder information available, when necessary, only to law-enforcement authorities or regulators, as already happens with private banks.
Besides, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not actually anonymous, given that individuals and organizations using crypto-wallets still leave a digital footprint.
And authorities that legitimately want to track criminals and terrorists will soon crack down on attempts to create crypto-currencies with complete privacy.
Insofar as CBDCs would crowd out worthless cryptocurrencies, they should be welcomed.
Moreover, by transferring payments from private to central banks, a CBDC-based system would be a boon for financial inclusion.
Millions of unbanked people would have access to a near-free, efficient payment system through their cell phones.
The main problem with CBDCs is that they would disrupt the current fractional-reserve system through which commercial banks create money by lending out more than they hold in liquid deposits.
Banks need deposits in order to make loans and investment decisions.
If all private bank deposits were to be moved into CBDCs, then traditional banks would need to become “loanable funds intermediaries,” borrowing long-term funds to finance long-term loans such as mortgages.
In other words, the fractional-reserve banking system would be replaced by a narrow-banking system administered mostly by the central bank.
That would amount to a financial revolution – and one that would yield many benefits.
Central banks would be in a much better position to control credit bubbles, stop bank runs, prevent maturity mismatches, and regulate risky credit/lending decisions by private banks.
So far, no country has decided to go this route, perhaps because it would entail a radical disintermediation of the private banking sector.
One alternative would be for central banks to lend back to private banks the deposits that moved into CBDCs.
But if the government was effectively banks’ only depositor and provider of funds, the risk of state interference in their lending decisions would be obvious.
Lagarde, for her part, has advocated a third solution: private-public partnerships between central banks and private banks.
“Individuals could hold regular deposits with financial firms, but transactions would ultimately get settled in digital currency between firms,” she explained recently at the Singapore Fintech Festival.
“Similar to what happens today, but in a split second.”
The advantage of this arrangement is that payments “would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous.”
Moreover, “central banks would retain a sure footing in payments.”
This is a clever compromise, but some purists will argue that it would not solve the problems of the current fractional-reserve banking system.
There would still be a risk of bank runs, maturity mismatches, and credit bubbles fueled by private-bank-created money.
And there would still be a need for deposit insurance and lender-of-last-resort support, which itself creates a moral hazard.
Such issues would need to be managed through regulation and bank supervision, and that wouldn’t necessarily be enough to prevent future banking crises.
In due time, CBDC-based narrow banking and loanable-funds intermediaries could ensure a better and more stable financial system.
If the alternatives are a crisis-prone fractional-reserve system and a crypto-dystopia, then we should remain open to the idea.

The Revolt of China’s Twittering Classes
BEIJING – Last week, Liu Xiaobo was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.
That award comes at a crucial moment in Chinese politics, as it may well become a stepping stone on China’s long march toward greater freedom.
Yet few voices in mainland Chinese media are discussing Liu’s Nobel Prize.
The government’s propaganda department has ordered major media to keep the news from spreading to the general public by imposing strict censorship.
In fact, on CCTV’s widely viewed 7 p.m. national newscast, not a word on Liu was mentioned on the day he received the prize.
Despite this news blackout, China’s blogosphere and microblogs exploded after Liu was announced as the winner.
For example, on Sina’s microblog site, bloggers used pictures, euphemisms, and English or traditional Chinese characters to avoid censorship.
Twitter-style microblogging is extremely popular in China.
Twitter.com was officially blocked last year, following the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown and the riots in Xinjiang that summer.
Soon afterwards, its most famous Chinese clone, Fanfou.com, also was closed down, leaving one million registered users homeless.
Nevertheless, although Twitter can be accessed in China only via proxy servers, it still plays a vital role in Chinese Internet life because of its ability to connect different news sources and social activists.
Indeed, Twitter is the only place where people can talk freely about Liu‘s Nobel prize.
A search of the hash tag “#Liuxiaobo” shows that relevant messages pop up hundreds of times per minute.
More generally, Twitter has become a powerful tool for Chinese citizens as they increasingly play a role in reporting local news in their communities. But the social revolution brought by microblogging might be even more important than the communication revolution.
Indeed, here Chinese Twitter users lead the world, using it for everything from social resistance, civic investigation, and monitoring public opinion, to creating black satire, “organizing without organizations” in the Guangdong anti-incineration movement, and mailing postcards to prisoners of conscience.
Ever since Iranians used Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests against the stolen presidential election of June 2009, there has been much discussion about the role of digital activism in authoritarian countries like China.
Does Web 2.0 technology imply an analogous role for “Twivolution” in a Chinese democratic transition one day?
Twitter political activism in China challenges the simplistic yet widespread assumption that social media in the hands of activists can lead swiftly to mass mobilization and social change.
Instead, these information-sharing tools and channels promote more subtle social progress.
That subtlety reflects the distinction between macro-politics and micro-politics. Macro-politics is structural, whereas micro-politics is daily.
Changes in the micro-political system do not necessarily lead to an adjustment in the macro structure, particularly in hyper-controlled political systems like China’s. But if small units are well organized, they can greatly improve the well-being of society as a whole, bit by bit, by working at the micro level.
“Micro-information” and “micro-exchange” can push forward real change.
Why is micro-power so important?
In the past, only a few highly motivated people engaged in political activism; the masses took almost no initiative.
Passionate people did not understand why the public seemed unconcerned about their efforts.
Today, highly motivated people can lower the threshold for action so that people with less passion join their efforts.
Currently, the Chinese Twittersphere has three prominent features: First, as China’s rulers strengthen their censorship efforts, Twitter has become highly politicized.
Moreover, Twitters brings opinion leaders together around one virtual table, attracting a lot of “new public intellectuals” and “rights advocates,” as well as veterans of civil rights movements and exiled dissidents.
Its influence on Chinese cyberspace and traditional media is the result of this grouping.
Finally, Twitter can be used as a mobilizing tool in China.
Recent years have seen an explosion of activities indicating that Twitter has become the coordinating platform for many campaigns asserting citizens’ rights.
With the proliferation of Twitter clones in China (all the major portals now offer microblog services), social movements in China are getting a long-term boost.
So Twitter has become a major tool to promote contentious politics in China.
It can effectively link discourse and action, generate widespread campaigns, and forge common ground among rights activists, public intellectuals, and all kinds of Twitter users.
In fact, a series of protests and events held since the second half of 2009 suggests a close relationship between Twitter and contentious real-life politics, and thus invites new possibilities for reshaping China’s authoritarian regime.

The US and Iran Are Playing a Dangerous Game
BERLIN – As the United States and Iran face off in the Persian Gulf, their asymmetric conflict risks spiraling out of control.
Unless the rest of the world gets involved, the dangerous game both countries are playing could end in direct confrontation.
The spiral was arguably set in motion in May 2018, when the US announced its withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions.
Since then, the US has escalated its sanctions multiple times, as part of a “maximum pressure” strategy that has slashed Iran’s commercial transactions with the rest of the world, gutted oil revenues, spurred currency devaluation, and sent the economy into recession.
Because Iran doesn’t have the capacity to respond in kind to the US, it has had to get creative.
For starters, it has put pressure on America’s European allies – including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union as a whole – arguing that they should step in to ensure the benefits that it was supposed to gain under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the 2015 agreement is formally known.
At the same time, Iran has reduced its compliance with several of its JCPOA commitments – for example, exceeding agreed limits for nuclear enrichment and resuming research on advanced centrifuges.
While US President Donald Trump’s administration seems unable to understand the danger this poses, the EU does.
Moreover, Iran is using asymmetrical warfare in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula.
In recent months, it has seized multiple foreign oil tankers.
It has also downed a US military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz – a vital sea-lane for oil shipments – and seems to be responsible for a series of acts of sabotage on nearby ships.
The attacks by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Saudi oil installations have also been attributed to Iran.
Whether these episodes can be attributed directly or indirectly to Iran is largely irrelevant.
What matters is that they align with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s 2018 declaration that if Iran was prevented from selling its oil, “no oil will be exported from the Persian Gulf.”
Iran has so far been able to turn the asymmetry of absolute power into a tactical advantage.
Yes, the US has the superior military.
But Trump does not want to lead the US into yet another war in the Middle East, especially not one that would require him to deploy tens of thousands of US troops.
Moreover, while the US sanctions have inflicted serious harm on Iran, there is little scope for further measures.
By playing such a strong card, the Trump administration may well have spent it for good, demolishing its own leverage and a critical incentive for Iran to meet its JCPOA commitments.
By neutralizing the threat of a sanctions “snapback” included in the nuclear deal, the US has raised the risk of violations by Iran that bring it closer to developing nuclear weapons.
Still, Iran’s position is not particularly strong.
Just as the US has depleted the potential of sanctions, Iran may have depleted America’s patience for its asymmetric tactics.
Immediately following the attack on the Saudi oil facilities, Trump hinted at military action.
Another unattributed attack of this sort – let alone anything bigger or resulting in American casualties – might be a bridge too far.
When the US and Iran have played all their cards in the current game, a more dangerous one is likely to begin.
That doesn’t necessarily have to mean open kinetic warfare.
But third parties like Saudi Arabia and Israel could launch their own asymmetric attacks, and the US itself could turn to asymmetric warfare. All of these actors have played this game before, though not on a grand scale.
Recognizing the danger of continued asymmetric escalation, the JCPOA’s European signatories and regional actors such as the United Arab Emirates have proposed steps to defuse the conflict.
These include, first and foremost, direct talks between Iran and the US, which the Europeans seem to be working to facilitate.
In this process, Europe would do well to disregard the hype about a meeting between the two countries’ presidents.
Other high-level officials would do, and they could meet within various bilateral or multilateral frameworks.
The remaining JCPOA signatories – China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the EU – want to salvage what they can of the 2015 agreement, as a meeting in Vienna in July on the topic showed.
But a diplomatic solution to the tensions between Iran and the US will also require the involvement of Iran’s neighbors.
Other ideas for easing tensions are also on the table.
For example, French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed extending a $15 billion credit line to Iran that would help to offset the sanctions-induced loss of oil revenues.
Various plans for talks on regional security have also been put forward.
Such efforts offer some reason for hope.
But the situation is increasingly tenuous, and it could get much worse – potentially leading to a direct confrontation between the US and Iran – before diplomacy can make it better.

Greenwashing Tyranny at COP27
HEIDELBERG – Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been trying to use the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), which started this week in Sharm El-Sheikh, to position Egypt as a global leader in sustainability, touting various environmental initiatives.
And to make the most of the opportunity, his autocratic regime has been exploiting the gathering to greenwash its poor human-rights record and repressive tactics.
Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who is also COP27’s president-designate, recently emphasized the importance of civil society in “holding companies and governments to account, guarding against greenwashing, and ensuring a just transition” to renewable energy.
But, as far as Egypt itself is concerned, that is nothing more than propaganda.
In reality, the country’s civil-society groups are facing an unprecedented government crackdown.
Since el-Sisi seized power in 2014, following a military coup the previous year, his regime has run roughshod over basic components of governance such as political parties, parliament, and the constitution. The regime has persecuted activists, labeled opposition groups terrorist organizations, and relied on military intelligence and other national-security bodies – headed by members of his own family – to consolidate power.
Civil-society organizations have been crippled by draconian laws prohibiting NGOs from engaging in public affairs.
According to Human Rights Watch, the authorities have frozen the assets of seven prominent human-rights organizations and forced many others to close.
Officials have also dissolved more than 2,000 charity organizations, seized their assets over alleged links to the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, and expanded the crackdown to include environmental activists.
This non-stop assault on NGOs and their staff has severely shrunk what was once a vibrant public sphere, even during the three decades of Hosni Mubarak’s dictatorship.
El-Sisi maintains an iron grip on power by controlling Egypt’s security apparatus.
In 2018, he appointed his then-chief of staff, Abbas Kamel, to lead Egypt’s General Intelligence Service and made his son Mahmoud the GIS’s deputy head.
Since then, the intelligence establishment has been controlling key institutions behind the scenes.
It has taken over private media companies, merged them under the holding company United Media Services, and turned them into propaganda outlets glorifying el-Sisi as Egypt’s “guardian” and calling on Egyptians to support their leader’s “war on terror” in the Sinai Peninsula.
The GIS’s primary objective has always been to repress any hint of civil unrest or popular uprising.
To this end, the regime introduced two major reforms.
In November 2013, it enacted the protest law, which requires organizers to provide advance notice of their intention to hold protests, bans unauthorized gatherings of over ten people, restricts where protests can take place, and carries penalties of up to five years in prison.
Participating in peaceful demonstrations also carries a fine of up to 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($4,100).
Two years later, in August 2015, the regime enacted an anti-terrorism law that vaguely defines what constitutes terrorist “entities” and includes a provision criminalizing the dissemination of “false” reports on terrorist attacks – that is, any information not released by the government.
In addition, the regime has been uprooting trees and razing green spaces, particularly in Cairo, supposedly to build new roads and bridges as part of a new urban development drive.
In reality, the main reason for the regime’s landscaping projects is to make the public sphere inhospitable to any political gathering that might evolve into a spontaneous mass uprising.
The GIS wields de facto control over every political event in Egypt, from parliamentary elections and constitutional referenda to the passage of new legislation.
And it is the body overseeing COP27 as well.
By directly managing the conference’s registry system, Egypt’s intelligence apparatus has excluded critical voices and ensured that only pro-government NGOs could register.
Security forces have reportedly arrested dozens of activists – including an Indian activist who led a march from Cairo to Sharm El-Sheikh to raise awareness of climate change – to thwart any attempt to stage protests during the two-week gathering.
More than 11 years after the Tahrir Square uprising that toppled Mubarak’s regime, and in the eight years since the military coup that removed the Muslim Brotherhood from power, el-Sisi has cemented his grip on Egypt.
But his tactics have deepened the rift between the country’s rival factions, fueling political instability.
The world leaders who have gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh must not lose sight of the brutality of el-Sisi’s regime.
A dictatorship teetering on the edge of political turmoil is hardly an appropriate location for COP27 – or for any gathering whose stated goal is to realize a better future for humanity.

What Yellen Must Do
NEW YORK – US President-elect Joe Biden’s decision to appoint Janet Yellen as the next Secretary of the Treasury is good news for America and the world.
The United States has survived four years under a mendacious president who has no understanding of, let alone respect for, the rule of law, the principles undergirding democracy and the market economy, or even basic human decency.
Not only has Donald Trump spent the weeks since the presidential election spewing lies about non-existent voter fraud; he has also convinced a large majority of his party to embrace these lies, thus revealing the frailty of American democracy.
Undoing the damage will not be easy, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic compounding America’s problems.
Fortunately, no one is better equipped – in intellect, experience, values, and interpersonal skills – to deal with today’s economic challenges than Yellen, whom I first met when she was a graduate student at Yale University in the 1960s.
First on the agenda will be recovery from the pandemic.
With multiple vaccines in sight, the immediate task is to build a bridge from here to the post-crisis economy.
It is too late for a “V-shaped recovery.”
Many businesses have gone bankrupt, and many more will do so in the coming weeks and months; household and firm balance sheets are being eviscerated.
Worse, headline figures may belie the depth of the crisis.
The pandemic has taken a massive toll at the bottom of the income and wealth distribution.
Those who have availed themselves of policies to prevent evictions and foreclosures are nonetheless falling deeper into debt, and could soon face a reckoning.
The current outlook would have been much better if only we had had a president and Congress that recognized back in May that COVID-19 would not just disappear on its own.
Strong initial support programs that needed to be extended were not, resulting in avoidable economic damage that will now be hard to reverse.
The devastation of the restaurant and travel industries has received plenty of attention, but this may be merely the tip of the iceberg.
Educational institutions, especially many colleges and universities, have been hit badly.
And state and local governments constrained by balanced-budget laws now face plummeting revenues.
Without federal aid, they will have to make deep cuts to employment and public programs, which will weaken the broader economy.
The US desperately needs large rescue programs targeted specifically at the most vulnerable households and sectors.
The resulting debt from increased spending should not be viewed as a hindrance, given the enormous cost of doing too little.
Besides, with interest rates near zero and likely to stay there for years to come, the costs of servicing new debt are exceedingly low.
Moreover, many of the necessary recovery programs can be designed to serve multiple goals, by putting the economy on a more sustainable, resilient, and knowledge-based footing.
Much will depend on Congress, but the economic case for providing more support is clear, and Yellen is well equipped to articulate it.
Much will depend on the global recovery as well.
Here, the new administration will have more room to maneuver.
There is already strong global support for a massive $500 billion issuance of Special Drawing Rights, the supranational currency overseen by the International Monetary Fund, which would go a long way toward supporting many struggling economies.
Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi blocked this option. It should now be at the top of the agenda.
Moreover, with many countries soon to be unable to meet their debt obligations, a quick and deep restructuring would help enormously.
To move that process forward, the Biden administration should state clearly that it is in America’s own national interest to uphold the basic principle of sovereign immunity, as endorsed by the overwhelming majority of United Nations member states in 2015.
Debt restructuring is necessary for the global recovery and is the humanitarian thing to do.
If there was ever a time when the principle of force majeure should apply, it is now.
Restoring multilateralism would help, too.
For the past four years, innumerable conflicts between the US and everyone else has cast a pall of uncertainty over the global economy.
It should go without saying that uncertainty is bad for business and bad for investment.
A return to normalcy on the part of the US – rejoining the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, for example, and re-engaging with the World Trade Organization (and allowing judges to be appointed to its Appellate Body) – would thus go a long way toward restoring confidence.
But a return to normalcy must not mean a return to neoliberalism.
On trade and many other aspects of the twenty-first-century economic framework, policy agendas need to be revisited and reformed.
It is unclear how far Biden will go down this road.
But we can at least be confident that the new administration won’t embrace the zero-sum logic that underpinned Trump’s approach to everything.
Ensuring global stability will require deep cooperation in combating climate change, pandemics, and many other threats.
The challenge will be to find ways to do so while remaining fully and vocally committed to our values.
While Trump severely undermined the international political and economic order, its fissures were long evident before he arrived.
After all, the 2008 financial crisis discredited neoliberalism, with its belief in unfettered deregulation; and the subsequent euro crisis demonstrated that austerity under such conditions does not work.
It is clear that neoliberalism has led to lower growth, higher inequality, and all of the social and political consequences that we have seen in recent years.
Now, the pandemic has put the final nail in neoliberalism’s coffin, revealing an economy utterly lacking in resilience and a state left incapable of responding effectively to a crisis.
Yellen can help to provide the leadership necessary to build a better post-pandemic world.
To succeed, an ideology that serves the few at the expense of the many must give way to one based on democratic values and shared prosperity.

Europe’s Political Stress Tests
PRINCETON – In recent years, the European Union – or, more accurately, the powerful countries of northern Europe – has been subjecting its weaker members to social and political “stress tests” in the name of fiscal rectitude.
As a result, southern Europe and parts of Eastern Europe have become a kind of political laboratory, with experiments producing strikingly varied – and increasingly unpredictable – outcomes in different countries.
At the last EU summit, Luxembourg’s prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, even suggested that the risk of a “social revolution” should not be excluded.
While that outcome remains unlikely, it is increasingly clear that many European countries – and the EU as a whole – need to renegotiate their basic social contracts.
But European elites, preoccupied with short-term fixes, have not considered the long-term need for such revisions – to their own detriment.
Indeed, despite significant variations by country, one trend is becoming increasingly apparent across the EU: voters, regardless of their political orientation, are ejecting at the first opportunity leaders who implement austerity.
But, beyond this overwhelming opposition to austerity, countries’ experiences vary widely.
Greece has seen the rise of an overtly fascist party, Golden Dawn, which proudly celebrates the legacy of former dictator Ioannis Metaxas.
Although Golden Dawn has existed for roughly two decades, only in the last year did it gain enough support to enter parliament.
Moreover, its poll numbers continue to climb.
Golden Dawn’s success does not reflect a deep-seated desire among Greeks to return to authoritarianism.
The party has simply stepped in where the Greek state – long plagued by inefficiency and corruption – has retreated, providing basic welfare and other services to desperate citizens, while engaging in unprecedented violence against people who are or look like immigrants.
One way that Golden Dawn attempts to embody the state is by having party members out on the streets as vigilantes.
Austerity has similarly sharpened a long-standing crisis of statehood and political legitimacy in Italy, reflected in the rise of a new anti-establishment party, the Five Star Movement, which claims to transcend the traditional left-right political spectrum.
Indeed, the movement lacks clear policy objectives, instead capitalizing on popular disgust with Italy’s political elites – a sentiment that led directly to the last election’s failure to produce a clear winner.
The sense of revulsion is acute: Many of the Five Star Movement’s supportershope to transfer control of Italy’s government to citizen-representatives, whose every move would be digitally monitored to preclude corruption.
Some countries’ electorates initially backed austerity, but none has re-authorized it.
In Spain, for example, voters understood the implications of supporting the ruling Popular Party, making it one of the only southern states where the government had some kind of mandate to implement tough austerity.
But the mutually reinforcing recession and debt crisis that Spain now faces have reinvigorated Catalonia’s long-standing secessionist movement; austerity has transformed a chronic, though manageable, problem into an acute existential question.
Similarly, Portugal’s center-right Social Democratic Party has pushed a tough pro-austerity line, including tax hikes and spending cuts, since coming to power in 2011.
But new measures introduced last month have driven an increasingly frustrated population – which, until recently, had endured painful austerity with little of the public outcry seen elsewhere in southern Europe – to the streets to demand a general election two years ahead of schedule.
Political and social turmoil across southern Europe holds several lessons for austerity’s proponents – especially for Germany.
First and foremost, the dogma that solid public finances – and, more broadly, a functioning state – can be achieved only through painful austerity is an illusion.
When forced to choose between their societies and their clientele, politicians may well decide that allowing social tensions to rise – even to dangerous levels – is better than sacrificing their own power bases.
In fact, when Germany embarked a decade ago on a reform program featuring major cuts to the welfare state and a more flexible labor market, it broke the rules of the eurozone’s Stability and Growth Pact.
Public spending had to rise before it could fall, in order to provide some slack while renegotiating parts of the social contract.
The second lesson from southern Europe is that muddling through is unlikely to work.
Building the needed support for a new social contract will require an appeal to fairness, not just to fiscal rectitude.
And a mechanism to authorize the new deal – such as a grand coalition actually empowered by elections (not just reluctant support by major parties for technocratic leaders like Italy’s Mario Monti) – is essential.
Alternatively, citizens could try to lead efforts to re-negotiate their countries’ constitutional arrangements.
Iceland, for example, has embarked on an unprecedented experiment in crafting a bottom-up, “crowd-sourced” constitution.
Similarly, albeit less radically, ordinary citizens comprise two-thirds of Ireland’s Constitutional Convention.
If southern eurozone countries followed the route of forging a new social deal, they would have to ensure that it ultimately intersects with the paths of the northern European members.
While all eurozone countries do not have to converge on a single model, their interdependence means that a pan-European social and economic settlement is needed.
European leaders must move beyond the increasingly implausible mantra of “belt-tightening today; full bellies tomorrow,” and recognize that, at its core, the euro crisis is a political crisis.
Rather than focus on quick policy fixes, Europe’s leaders need to pursue long-term solutions.
And that includes new social contracts.

Building Pax Asia-Pacifica
MANILA – One of the main sources of tension in Asia nowadays are the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, where the Philippines, Vietnam, China, and others have conflicting claims.
In Chinese media reports, the heightened “unfriendliness” in the region has allegedly arisen from “bad rumors and speculations” on the part of Filipino commentators.
But the reality is starker: the intrusions by Chinese aircraft into Filipino airspace in May; Chinese patrol boats cruising in March in the Recto (Reed) Bank, 85 miles west of the Filipino island of Palawan; and, most serious of all, a Chinese missile frigate firing at Filipino fishing boats in February near Palawan’s Quirino atoll.
Will armed conflict result from these recurring – and, it seems, escalating – disputes between the Philippines and Vietnam on one side, and China on the other?
War, of course, is in no one’s interest.
But the risk posed by these disputes is growing, because China’s relations with both the Philippines and Vietnam are at their lowest point in decades.
Given these tensions, it is no surprise that the issue of disputed sovereignty in the South China Sea is almost certain to claim center stage at this month’s ASEAN Regional Forum, and at the East Asia summit in Bali that will follow it.
Last June, I gave the keynote speech at the celebrations marking the 36th anniversary of the establishment of Philippines-China diplomatic relations and the 10th anniversary of Philippines-China “Friendship Day” in the presence of 5,000 of my countrymen and a smattering of Chinese officials.
Yet on that same day, the headlines in Chinese papers were blasting the Philippines for its historic claim to ownership of the Spratly Islands.
Of course, the governments of both countries recognize the need to maintain the stability and cooperation that have made East Asia the world’s fastest growing region.
The same is true of Vietnam’s government and that of the United States.
But there is no institutionalized means to discuss and resolve the dispute, which is taking on greater significance almost daily, owing to the belief that vast mineral and energy resources lay on the sea bed around the Spratlys.
Now is the time for China, the Philippines, Vietnam, other claimants, and the US to take action to begin to diminish these tensions.
What is needed, above all, is a covenant among the leaders of the Asia/Pacific region that will make peaceful dispute resolution binding on all stakeholders, big or small.
Only such a pledge can provide the type of certainty that investors – any investors – will need if the Spratly resources are to be developed.
Certainly, China’s leaders talk as if this is their goal.
In April, at this year’s Boao Forum (the Asian Davos) on Hainan Island, Chinese President Hu Jintao asserted: “Peace and development remain the overriding themes of the times.
The world needs peace, countries deserve development, and people want cooperation....China will always be a good neighbor, good friend, and good partner of other Asian countries.”
It is past time to make those sentiments a reality; more than a pledge to resolve disputes peacefully is needed.
Asia’s governments must also begin to adhere to a far more expansive idea of open regionalism, which means that countries like India should have a voice in Asia/Pacific affairs, and they must respect the Asian interests of countries beyond the region.
The US, for example, should be made welcome to participate – or continue to participate – in peacekeeping and security cooperation.
But how is Asia to reach consensus on this point?
Ever since 1994, when Vietnam’s President Le Duc Anh held the presidency of ASEAN, I have proposed to ASEAN leaders that the Spratlys be demilitarized as a first step toward building trust.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and associated international commitments must become the basis for productive dialogues leading to binding covenants.
Joint exploration and development of the resources within and beneath the archipelago could then begin.
More broadly, the urgent task for Asian statesmen over the next 5-10 years will be to replace the region’s Pax Americana, which has guaranteed regional stability for decades, with a more comprehensive Pax Asia-Pacifica that is built on inclusiveness and burden-sharing.
But such an Asia-Pacific peace will be durable only if it is based on a balance of mutual benefits rather than on the balance of power.
Clearly, this concept implies burden-sharing by all Asia-Pacific countries to ensure the region’s harmony and security.
Pax Asia-Pacifica’s institutions will need to be built, as Europe’s peace was built after World War II, on strong, cooperative undertakings among the most powerful countries and regional blocs – the US, China, Japan, India, South Korea, Russia, and the ASEAN 10.
The region’s continued economic growth and progress require that we Asians contain our rivalries and avoid the arms buildups that, unfortunately, now seem to be underway.

Can America Avoid an Election Crisis?
BRUSSELS – The 2020 US presidential election is unlike any other in living memory.
Previous contests have been rancorous and some were described in existential terms. But never, at least in recent times, have Americans faced the realistic prospect of the incumbent rejecting the outcome, and rarely have partisan divisions risked escalating into armed conflict.
We at the International Crisis Group (ICG) have a mandate to end, prevent, and mitigate violent conflicts wherever they emerge.
While our efforts over the past quarter-century have taken us all around the world, not until this year have they required us to focus squarely on the United States.
In many countries, elections often come with a risk of bloodshed, owing to such factors as extreme political polarization, winner-take-all stakes, a proliferation of weapons in the hands of armed groups with political agendas, and flawed electoral processes that leave many citizens doubting the results.
Under these conditions, elections can be particularly dangerous when each candidate has a sizable and committed base of support.
These risk factors are all in some measure present in the US today.
But the one that stands head and shoulders above the others is the incumbent’s refusal to commit to respecting the will of the voters.
US President Donald Trump continues to insist that the only way he could lose is if the election is rigged, and he has yet to call on his supporters to refrain from violence.
If the world were to look at the US the way the US often looks at younger, less robust democracies around the world, it would see a country still experiencing the lasting legacies of slavery, civil war, lynching, segregation, labor strife, and the ethnic cleansing of indigenous peoples.
It would observe a country awash in firearms, where the number of gun homicides each year is unmatched by any other high-income country. It would find that there is a deeply rooted white-supremacy movement that the US government’s own experts warn is growing in virulence.
The wider world would also shake its head at the racial discrimination, economic inequality, and police brutality that constitute chronic sources of tension in the US, periodically bubbling over into street demonstrations and, sometimes, civil unrest.
It would note that many major American cities have heavily militarized police forces that deploy weapons and tactics similar to those used by US soldiers in warzones and interventions abroad.
It would see that the dominant political parties are at loggerheads over profound questions of national identity, with many Democrats framing the election as a make-or-break moment for democracy, and many Republicans viewing Trump as a bulwark against cultural and demographic changes to the nation’s character.
In short, outside observers can see in the US today a lot of what the US historically has warned others about.
Moreover, the 2020 US election is being held under the cloud of a runaway pandemic.
A massive increase in mail-in voting will likely create openings for Trump to contest the outcome.
Given the perceived stakes, both sides can be expected to fight any dispute over the result fiercely.
And, given how convoluted US election laws are, a contested or inconclusive result could lead to months of tense indecision.
Equally worrying is the gathering threat posed by armed far-right cells, like the 13 men who were recently arrested for plotting to kidnap Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.
These groups may try to intimidate voters at the polls, and could stir up trouble if the outcome is disputed.
If they take to the streets, they will most likely be challenged by activists from the left; violent fringe actors could join in the mix, raising the risk of bloodshed.
A clash that disrupts voting or ballot counting in a crucial state could escalate quickly, particularly if Trump claims victory before the formal procedures are complete and calls his backers into the streets.
To be sure, the US has a fair chance of making it through this difficult moment without a spike in violence.
It still has advantages that other countries studied by the ICG typically lack, including an apolitical military, a vibrant press, and a well-developed civil society.
Leaders from both parties (including, notably, senior Republicans) have already signaled that their candidate could lose, which helps to head off demagogic claims of vote rigging after the fact.
Nonetheless, the situation warrants extraordinary precautions.
State and local officials, along with the relevant civil-society groups, should be acquainting themselves with the legal tools at their disposal and preparing to use them to ensure that voting and ballot counting proceeds without disruption.
Media outlets that have not already done so should establish policies to avoid declaring a winner prematurely, and the major social-media platforms will need all hands on deck to police disinformation.
Foreign heads of state and government also have an important role to play.
Trump might try to declare victory pre-emptively on November 3, claiming that only votes tabulated that day should count, and pressuring his foreign counterparts to recognize his purported success.
They must resist doing so. Until one candidate concedes or the process has run its course, foreign officials should refrain from making any congratulatory calls.
And should things take a turn for the worse, those with direct channels to Trump and his inner circle should send a clear message: “If you interfere with the vote count or refuse to accept a peaceful transfer of power, you will be on your own.”
With luck, and perhaps a little help from its friends, the US can dodge the 2020 election bullet and start repairing the social fractures that have helped bring it to this dangerous precipice.
For that to happen, it will need to apply some of the lessons it so frequently dispenses to others.

Picking Up the Pieces After Hanoi
NEW YORK – When last month’s summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended without a deal, the result was not surprising.
One or both countries came to Hanoi with a misunderstanding of what was possible.
The United States maintained that North Korea wanted nearly all international sanctions lifted upfront and was not prepared to give up enough of its nuclear facilities to warrant doing so.
North Korean officials explained that they were prepared to dismantle the country’s main facility, the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, “permanently and completely,” but only in exchange for a considerable reduction in existing sanctions.
The anticlimax in Hanoi was perhaps the inevitable result of a process in which the two leaders dominated, optimistic about their personal relationship and confident in their abilities. Senior officials and other staff members, who normally devote weeks and months to preparing for such summits, had but a limited role.
The question is what to do now.
One option is to try to negotiate a compromise: either more dismantling of nuclear infrastructure in exchange for more sanctions relief, or less dismantling in exchange for less relief.
Although one of these approaches may prove possible, either outcome would be less than ideal.
Simply agreeing to give up individual nuclear facilities is not the same as denuclearization.
Indeed, it does not necessarily even get us closer to denuclearization, because facilities could be built or expanded as others are being dismantled. Precisely this currently seems to be occurring.
Meanwhile, lifting sanctions removes the pressure on North Korea to take meaningful steps toward denuclearization.
So what are the alternatives?
Using even limited military force risks escalation, a costly war from which no one would benefit, and a crisis in relations between the US and South Korea.
And, given North Korea’s demonstrated resilience, existing or even additional sanctions alone are highly unlikely to be enough to coerce its leaders into abandoning their nuclear program.
Moreover, no matter how much pressure is brought to bear on North Korea, China and Russia will likely do whatever is necessary to ensure its survival, given their strategic interest in avoiding a reunified Korean Peninsula aligned with the US.
Hopes that North Korea will collapse under its own weight are thus unrealistic.
Trump seems to harbor the equally unrealistic notion that North Korea will voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons in order to become the next Asian economic tiger.
But while Kim wants sanctions relief, fundamental economic reform would threaten his tight grip on power, and giving up his nuclear weapons and missiles would make North Korea and himself vulnerable.
He has taken note of what happened to Ukraine, which voluntarily relinquished its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, as well as to Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi.
The status quo, however, is no solution.
The current testing moratorium could end; indeed, North Korea is threatening to resume tests and there is evidence it is reconstituting its principal missile-testing site.
This may be a bid to encourage the US to show more flexibility, or the North may actually be preparing to restart testing – a step that would likely lead the US to resume large-scale military exercises with South Korea and push for new sanctions.
Talks would likely be suspended; we would be back to where we were two years ago but with an overlay of recrimination and mistrust.
Even absent such developments, drift is not desirable.
North Korea could use the passage of time to increase the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal and make some improvements to its warheads and delivery systems without overt testing.
There is a big difference between a North Korea armed with a handful of inefficient warheads and inaccurate missiles and one with dozens of advanced weapons that could be mounted on accurate long-range missile systems capable of reaching the US.
At this point, any realistic policy must begin with accepting the reality that complete and fully verifiable denuclearization is not a realistic prospect any time soon.
It need not and should not be abandoned as a long-term goal, but it cannot dominate near-term policy.
An all-or-nothing policy toward North Korea will result in nothing.
So it makes sense to explore a phased approach.
In an initial phase, North Korea would agree to freeze not just the testing of its systems, but also the production of nuclear material, nuclear weapons, and long-range missiles.
This would require the North Korean authorities to provide a detailed accounting (a so-called declaration) of the relevant facilities and agree to verification by international inspectors.
In exchange, North Korea would receive the sort of substantial sanctions relief it sought in Hanoi.
There could also be an end to the state of war that has existed for the past seven decades, and liaison offices could be opened in Washington, DC, and Pyongyang.
But full sanctions relief and diplomatic normalization would come only with full denuclearization.
This might well be too much for North Korea, arguably the world’s most closed society.
If so, the bulk of the sanctions need to remain in place; they would be lifted only in proportion to any dismantling – and only so long as the world could be confident that North Korea was not developing new capabilities to replace those it was abandoning.
The US could specify which sites, in addition to Yongbyon, need to be dismantled.
Even this less ambitious approach would likely prove extraordinarily difficult.
But, given the high stakes and unattractive alternatives in dealing with North Korea, any viable route to a settlement that ensures long-term stability is worth pursuing.

The Missing Link in Europe's AI Strategy
BRUSSELS – The European Commission’s strategy for artificial intelligence focuses on the need to establish “trust” and “excellence.”
Recently proposed AI regulation, the Commission argues, will create trust in this new technology by addressing its risks, while excellence will follow from EU member states investing and innovating.
With these two factors accounted for, Europe’s AI uptake supposedly will accelerate.
Unfortunately, protecting EU citizens’ fundamental rights, which should be the AI regulation’s core objective, appears to be a secondary consideration; and protections for workers’ rights don’t seem to have been considered at all.
AI is a flagship component of Europe’s digital agenda, and the Commission’s legislative package is fundamental to the proposed single market for data.
The draft regulation establishes rules concerning the introduction, implementation, and use of AI systems.
It adopts a risk-based approach, with unacceptable, high-risk, limited, and low-risk uses.
Under the proposal, AI systems deemed “high-risk” – posing significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons – are subject to an ex ante conformity assessment to be carried out by the provider, without prior validation by a competent external authority.
Requirements include high-quality data sets, sound data governance and management practices, extensive record-keeping, adequate risk management, detailed technical documentation, transparent user instructions, appropriate human oversight, explainable results, and a high level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.
The Commission says that its definition of AI, as well as the risk-based approach underpinning the draft regulation, are based on public consultation. But the fact that industrial and tech firms constituted an overwhelming majority of the respondents to its 2020 AI White Paper suggests an exercise that is far from democratic.
These businesses, while pretending to promote knowledge, science, and technology, steered the regulatory process in a direction that serves their interests.
The voice of society, in particular trade unions, was drowned out.
The regulation has several shortcomings.
Among them are the Commission’s narrow risk-based approach, the absence of a redress mechanism, the failure to address the issue of liability for damage involving AI systems, and a reliance on regulatory sandboxes for providing “safe” environments in which to test new business models.
The draft also fails to deliver from a worker-protection perspective.
To address this shortcoming, an ad hoc directive that focuses on AI in the context of employment, which would protect workers (including those in the platform economy) and enable them to exercise their rights and freedoms on an individual or collective basis, would be a possible way forward.
Such a directive should address several key issues.
For starters, it should set employers’ responsibilities in preventing AI risks, in the same way that they are obliged to assess occupational health and safety hazards.
AI risks extend further, because they include possible abuses of managerial power stemming from the nature of the employment relationship, as well as other risks to workers’ privacy, fundamental rights, data protection, and overall health.
Safeguarding worker privacy and data protection is equally vital, because AI is hungry for data and workers are an important source of them.
The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a powerful tool that, in theory, applies to workers’ data in an employment context, including when these are used by an AI system. But in practice, it is almost impossible for workers to exercise their GDPR rights vis-à-vis an employer.
The EU should introduce additional provisions to ensure they can.
Making the purpose of AI algorithms explainable is important, too.
Here, firms’ workplace transparency provisions will not protect workers.
Instead, employers, as users of algorithms, need to account for the possible harm their deployment can do in a workplace.
The use of biased values or variables can lead to the profiling of workers, target specific individuals, and categorize them according to their estimated “risk level.”
Another priority is ensuring that workers can exercise their “right to explanation.”
The implication, here, is that employers would be obliged to consult employees before implementing algorithms, rather than informing them after the fact.
Moreover, the information provided must enable workers to understand the consequences of an automated decision.
The new ad hoc directive should also guarantee that the “human-in-command” principle is respected in all human-machine interactions at work.
This involves giving humans the last word and explaining which data sources are responsible for final decisions when humans and machines act together.
Trade unions should be considered as part of the “human” component and play an active role alongside managers, IT support teams, and external consultants.
Furthermore, EU lawmakers must prohibit algorithmic worker surveillance.
Currently, worker monitoring is regulated by national laws that often predate GDPR and do not cover advanced, intrusive people analytics.
AI-powered tools such as biometrics, machine learning, semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and emotion-sensing technology can measure people’s biology, behavior, concentration, and emotions.
Such algorithmic surveillance does not passively scan workers but rather “scrapes” their personal lives, actively builds an image, and then makes decisions.
Lastly, workers need to be able to exercise agency by becoming AI-literate.
Teaching them technical digital skills so that they can operate a particular system is not enough.
Understanding AI’s role and its effect on their work environment requires workers to be informed, educated, and critically engaged with the technology.
Regulating AI systems, in particular those deemed high-risk, should not be based on their providers’ self-assessment.
Europe can become a global leader in the field, and foster genuine public trust in and acceptance of this emerging technology; but only if it effectively protects and involves its citizens and workers.
No “human-centric” AI will ever exist if workers and their representatives are unable to flag up the technology’s specific employment-related risks.
In that regard, the Commission’s draft regulation leaves much to be desired.
The European Parliament and EU member states must now act and, in particular, integrate worker protection in the final version of this key regulation.

Lessons from the Global Slowdown
<d>
The UK’s Hard Brexit Choices Have Arrived
LONDON – Since the United Kingdom left the European Union, relations with its continental neighbors have gone from bad to worse.
On both sides, a toxic blend of distrust and nationalism increasingly infuses almost every contentious issue.
On the EU side, both the European Commission and several member states have woefully mishandled the rollout of the bloc’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
The EU has directed its threats of vaccine protectionism principally at the UK, whose vaccination campaign has so far gone well, while individual European governments have damagingly criticized the efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.
The complaints about the vaccine, developed by world-renowned experts at the University of Oxford, fly in the face of objective scientific evidence, thus inevitably raising suspicions of anti-British sentiment.
Moreover, they have made some Europeans reluctant to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and stirred up anti-vaccine sentiment more generally, thereby all but guaranteeing further avoidable COVID-19 deaths.
Many European governments took too long to come to their senses and restart their rollout of the vaccine with the full backing of health regulators.
The UK government, for its part, has again deliberately breached the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU that Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed early last year.
The UK has chosen to be outside the EU’s customs union and single market, while the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) remains in both.
So, the only way to avoid re-establishing a border between the Republic and Northern Ireland (which would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the UK province) is for Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union with a border of some sort between it and the British mainland.
Johnson signed up for this – something that his predecessor, Theresa May, refused to do – and then denied that there would be such a border.
Now, his European minister, David Frost (who is to diplomacy what a chainsaw is to origami), has announced that the UK will ignore the Withdrawal Agreement until it gets what it wants.
This stance confounds patient efforts to find ways to ease the inevitable problems that will arise from having a border in the Irish Sea.
So, what should have been a quiet period of nurturing post-Brexit UK-EU relations has turned into a barroom brawl.
Meanwhile, Johnson’s government recently spelled out how the UK will use its supposed freedom outside the Union in a policy document that attempts to flesh out the concept of “Global Britain” – as if the country had not had global interests and influence for centuries.
It is an elegantly written essay, shot through with well-known Johnsonian traits.
For example, it faithfully reflects his predilection for attempting to have his cake and eat it – and thus avoid hard choices.
But with almost all serious economists and business leaders expecting slower economic growth for the foreseeable future (as a result of Britain having left its main export market), hard choices will not avoid the UK.
It is not surprising that the government has not released an official projection of Brexit’s economic impact; if the figures were good, they would be published in bold.
Although few think that the UK economy will fall off a cliff, goods exports to the EU declined by 40% in January – immediately after new trading rules between the UK and the bloc came into force.
Obviously, some of this decrease was due to the pandemic, teething problems with new UK-EU border controls, and end-of-year stockpiling.
But no one will be surprised if the trend continues.
While ministers hunt for excuses, businesses face higher costs, more red tape, and delayed supplies.
“Global Britain” will apparently get around such problems by finding new markets in Asia.
Johnson’s policy paper suggests that the UK is shifting its trade and security focus eastward.
Having spent a significant part of my life working in Asia and on relationships with Asian countries – notably India, China, and Japan – I am well disposed to the idea in principle.
But what does it mean in practice?
New business in Asia cannot possibly replace all the business the UK currently risks losing in Europe.
There is no tunnel between Folkestone and New Delhi, and there are not 10,000 goods trucks a day shuttling between Dover and Shanghai.
Despite spectacular improvements in technology, countries invariably trade more with their close neighbors than with faraway friends.
Moreover, EU membership did not stop the UK from doing business with Asia in the past.
But whereas Germany’s goods exports to China in 2019 totaled €96 billion ($115 billion), the UK’s amounted to just £25.1 billion ($35 billion).
And while UK exports to China have increased by an annual average of 3.7% in real terms since 1980, China’s exports to Britain have grown by over 9% per year in the same period, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Stronger UK-China trade ties would present Johnson with another hard choice.
Will Britain continue to stand with other liberal democracies like the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan in trying to contain the threat that China poses to its region and the international rule of law?
Or will it kowtow whenever President Xi Jinping’s regime stamps its feet?
Those of us urging the UK to make a choice in this regard are not calling for a cold war with China, as Johnson suggests, but rather for stewardship of our relationships with all those who want to constrain China’s cruel, brutish, and untrustworthy behavior.
Besides cake-ism, the government’s policy review reflects another characteristic Johnsonian feature: a chasm between aspirations and reality that cannot be bridged by make-believe and mendacity.
The paper calls for the UK to become a global leader in science and technology, for example.
But on the same day that the government announced this goal, British universities expressed deep concern about possible cuts in research funding, not least in science, owing partly to Brexit, which forced these institutions to leave EU research programs.
So, the UK’s tough choices accumulate, and the problems lurking around the corner look menacing.
Britain will have to make the best of Brexit.
But it will be a long, hard struggle, all the more so with an evasive fabulist in charge.

Migration’s Hall of Mirrors
LONDON – On both sides of the Atlantic, anti-immigrant politics are undermining democracies and damaging lives.
Far-right nationalist parties are gaining traction in Europe, while millions of undocumented migrants suffer in the shadows.
In the United States, President Barack Obama, concerned about his party’s ability to retain control of the Senate, has decided to put off immigration reform until after the election in November.
Yet that may be the wrong approach.
A new public-opinion survey by the German Marshall Fund (GMF) reveals that anti-immigrant sentiment stems largely from misinformation, not entrenched animus.
The most important finding of the GMF’s Transatlantic Trends survey is that concern about immigrants falls sharply when people are given even the most basic facts.
For example, when asked if there are too many immigrants in their country, 38% of the Americans surveyed agreed. But when respondents were told how many foreigners actually reside in the US before being asked that question, their views changed significantly: just 21% replied that there were too many.
The same was true in country after country.
In the United Kingdom, 54% of respondents said that there were too many immigrants; that number fell to 31% among those who were given the facts about foreigners.
In Greece, 58% became 27%; Italy went from 44% to 22%; and so on.
The only countries without such a gap were those with either very little immigration, like Poland, or those with a more open, informed, and progressive political debate about immigration, like Sweden and Germany.
Other surveys have exposed extraordinary inaccuracies in perceptions of migrants.
In many developed countries, for example, the public believes that there are three times as many immigrants residing in their country as there really are.
The average Briton believes that 34% of UK residents are foreigners; the true number is just 11%.
Such distortions disappear in countries where migration challenges are confronted openly, discussed reasonably, and addressed with conviction.
The average Swede, for example, believes that 18% of the country’s population is composed of migrants; the actual number is close to 13%.
As a result, populism in these societies is not on the rise, and mainstream politicians do not vilify minorities and migrants.
This constitutes strong evidence that reality-based debate and policymaking can fundamentally transform the negative political dynamics generated by migration.
It also suggests that, by failing to engage voters on the reality of migration, mainstream politicians in Europe are manufacturing support for extremist parties.
This self-inflicted political wound is extremely dangerous.
The Transatlantic Trends survey also shows that the American public is not worried about legal migration, while around two-thirds believe that the children of immigrants are being well integrated into their communities.
These findings should embolden policymakers to be more proactive in designing pathways for legal migration and policies to integrate migrants.
Even when it comes to illegal immigrants, though US citizens express concern, they are more reasonable than their political leaders about how to solve the problem.
A plurality of Americans surveyed by the GMF, for example, said that illegal immigrants should be allowed to obtain legal status.
A deliberative approach to engaging the public on other aspects of migration also could help quell anti-migrant sentiment.
For example, recent research in several countries shows that immigrants as a whole contribute more economically to their communities than they take from them.
In Germany, a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation, to be released next month, shows that the net fiscal contribution per migrant amounted to €3,300 ($4,260) in 2012.
Such data upend the conventional wisdom that migrants are a drain on public services.
Of course, migration creates real challenges for communities and can lead to job losses and lower wages for native workers. But here, too, it is the absence of attention to these issues, not necessarily the presence of migrants, that is the problem.
Implementing vigorous retraining policies, for example, would be a better way to counter these adverse effects than calling for mass deportations.
This is one reason why labor unions, which once opposed immigration across the board, are now far more supportive of measures that would legalize undocumented workers and create more pathways for migration.
Informed public debate is the sine qua non of a democratic polity.
In its absence, bias and populism prevail.
The immigration debate will never be an easy one, but it can become less tendentious and more deliberative if its participants consider the facts.

Hunting the Higgs
CAMBRIDGE – Fifty years ago, particle physicists faced an unexpected challenge.
Their best mathematical models could account for some of the natural forces that explain the structure and behavior of matter at a fundamental level, such as electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactive decay.
But the models worked only if the particles inside of atoms had no mass.
How could huge conglomerations of such particles – proteins, people, planets – behave as they do if their constituent parts weighed nothing at all?
Some physicists invented a clever workaround. They suggested that a type of particle exists that had never been detected; it was eventually named in honor of the British physicist Peter Higgs.
For a half-century, physicists searched for the elusive “Higgs particle.”
Now, following research conducted at CERN, the sprawling particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, the hunt may soon be over.
At first blush, the idea behind the Higgs particle sounds outlandish.
Higgs and his colleagues suggested that every elementary particle really is massless, just as the mathematical models require, and hence all particles would ordinarily zip around at the speed of light.
But suppose that everything around us – every single particle in the universe – is immersed in a huge, unseen vat of Higgs particles.
Whenever most kinds of particles move from point A to point B, they continually bump into Higgs particles, slowing their motion.
When we observe them, they appear to lumber along like holiday shoppers in a crowded store.
From their slow motion, we infer that they have mass.
While a 50-year search for a hypothetical particle reminiscent of a bizarre fairytale might seem quixotic, the Higgs particle stands at the center of the “Standard Model” of particle physics.
Every experimental test of the model so far has matched theoretical expectations.
In some striking examples, the agreement between prediction and measurement has stretched out to twelve decimal places, making the Standard Model the most accurate scientific theory in human history.
The model successfully accounts for three of the four basic forces of nature; only gravity remains beyond its purview.
Higgs particles might have played an even more substantial role at earlier moments in cosmic history.
My own research, along with that of physicists around the world, has focused on what effects Higgs particles might have had just fractions of a second after the big bang – effects that could explain the shape and fate of the universe.
And yet, for all that, we still have no direct evidence that Higgs particles even exist.
According to the Standard Model, Higgs particles scatter off each other, so they, too, should have mass.
The latest research indicates that Higgs particles (if they exist) should be among the most massive critters of the subatomic realm, more than 120 times as massive as the familiar proton.
To produce such a particle in the laboratory requires revving up protons to nearly the speed of light and smashing them together, which the Large Hadron Collider at CERN accomplishes trillions of times per second.
The energetic collisions produce all manner of debris, which physicists carefully track with huge detectors and sift with sophisticated computer algorithms.
Physicists confront two major hurdles in their hunt for the Higgs.
First, they must identify patterns in the debris that could have come from the production and rapid decay of a Higgs particle.
The sought-after signal is well understood in principle, given what we know about the Standard Model.
So is the background noise from all of the other junk that comes flying out when two protons collide with colossal energy.
Physicists searching for a few Higgs-like needles in a mind-bogglingly large haystack must comb their data for anomalies in the debris that cannot be accounted for by known processes.
The second difficulty concerns statistics.
The rules of quantum theory, on which the Standard Model is built, are at root probabilistic.
There will always be statistical flukes in the data, just as any series of coin tosses can produce an unexpected string of seven heads in a row.
To know with confidence that the coin is ordinary, with no hidden features, one must log a sufficiently large number of coin flips and check whether the data include equal numbers of heads and tails over the long run.
After thousands of coin tosses, if the data still show a bias toward heads, one may be justified in thinking that the coin has some unusual properties.
The same holds true for all of the chaff from the protons’ collisions.
Before physicists can claim that their anomalies really come from Higgs particles, they must gather enough data to rule out flukes.
At CERN, two independent teams of physicists recently announced that their data were consistent with detection of a Higgs particle, though there remained a 1-in-2,000 chance that the signal came from mundane, non-Higgs processes.
So the teams will continue smashing protons together, gathering more data, and sifting for signs of a Higgs.
We might not have the Higgs in hand right now.
But the latest news is the strongest indication yet that the 50-year hunt for one of the most fundamental bits of matter might well be coming to a successful conclusion.
The next time the CERN teams call a press conference, it could be weighty news indeed.

Another Nobel Surprise for Economics
NEW HAVEN – The winner of this year’s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago, is a controversial choice.
Thaler is known for his lifelong pursuit of behavioral economics (and its subfield, behavioral finance), which is the study of economics (and finance) from a psychological perspective.
For some in the profession, the idea that psychological research should even be part of economics has generated hostility for years.
Not from me.
I find it wonderful that the Nobel Foundation chose Thaler.
The economics Nobel has already been awarded to a number of people who can be classified as behavioral economists, including George Akerlof, Robert Fogel, Daniel Kahneman, Elinor Ostrom, and me.
With the addition of Thaler, we now account for approximately 6% of all Nobel economics prizes ever awarded.
But many in economics and finance still believe that the best way to describe human behavior is to eschew psychology and instead model human behavior as mathematical optimization by separate and relentlessly selfish individuals, subject to budget constraints.
Of course, not all economists, or even a majority, are wedded to this view, as evidenced by the fact that both Thaler and I have been elected president, in successive years, of the American Economic Association, the main professional body for economists in the United States.
But many of our colleagues unquestionably are.
I first met Thaler in 1982, when he was a professor at Cornell University.
I was visiting Cornell briefly, and he and I took a long walk across the campus together, discovering along the way that we had similar ideas and research goals.
For 25 years, starting in 1991, he and I co-organized a series of academic conferences on behavioral economics, under the auspices of the US National Bureau of Economic Research.
Over all those years, however, there has been antagonism – and even what appeared to be real animus – toward our research agenda.
Thaler once told me that Merton Miller, who won the economics Nobel in 1990 (he died in 2000), would not even make eye contact when passing him in the hallway at the University of Chicago.
Miller explained his reasoning (if not his behavior) in a widely cited 1986 article called “Behavioral Rationality in Finance.”
Miller conceded that sometimes people are victims of psychology, but he insisted that stories about such mistakes are “almost totally irrelevant” to finance.
The concluding sentence of his review is widely quoted by his admirers: “That we abstract from all these stories in building our models is not because the stories are uninteresting but because they may be too interesting and thereby distract us from the pervasive market forces that should be our principal concern.”
Stephen A. Ross of MIT, another finance theorist who was a likely future Nobel laureate until he died unexpectedly in March, argued along similar lines.
In his 2005 book Neoclassical Finance, he, too, eschewed psychology, preferring to build a “methodology of finance as the implication of the absence of arbitrage.”
In other words, we can learn a lot about people’s behavior just from the observation that there are no ten-dollar bills lying around on public sidewalks.
However psychologically bent some people are, one can bet that they will pick up the money as soon as they spot it.
Both Miller and Ross made wonderful contributions to financial theory.
But their results are not the only descriptions of economic and financial forces that should interest us, and Thaler has been a major contributor to a behavioral research program that has demonstrated this.
For example, in 1981, Thaler and Santa Clara University’s Hersh Shefrin advanced an “economic theory of self-control” that describes economic phenomena in terms of people’s inability to control their impulses.
Sure, people have no trouble motivating themselves to pick up a ten-dollar bill that they might find on a sidewalk. There is no self-control issue there.
But they will have trouble resisting the impulse to spend it. As a result, most people save too little for their retirement years.
Economists need to know about such mistakes that people repeatedly make.
During a long subsequent career, involving work with UCLA’s Shlomo Benartzi and others, Thaler has proposed mechanisms that will, as he and Harvard Law School’s Cass Sunstein put it in their book Nudge, change the “choice architecture” of these decisions. The same people, with the same self-control problems, could be enabled to make better decisions.
Improving people’s saving behavior is not a small or insignificant matter.
To some extent, it is a matter of life or death, and, more pervasively, it determines whether we achieve fulfillment and satisfaction in life.
Thaler has shown in his research how to focus economic inquiry more decisively on real and important problems.
His research program has been both compassionate and grounded, and he has established a research trajectory for young scholars and social engineers that marks the beginning of a real and enduring scientific revolution.
I couldn’t be more pleased for him – or for the profession.

The Mullah-Led Development Model
ISLAMABAD – A longstanding debate in economics – and among social scientists more broadly – centers on how best to deliver international aid to developing countries.
Should these countries’ governments rely on top-down wisdom from donor capitals?
Or should they focus more on funding bottom-up solutions dictated by recipients?
With the Trump administration proposing to cut the US State Department’s budget and reduce the amount of money various US agencies allocate to the world’s poorest, this debate is taking on a new urgency.
And a response from the Islamic world – the recipient of much of America’s aid in recent years – may hold important lessons for devising the best way forward.
Simply put, Western countries’ current approach is not working. This can be seen most clearly in my country, Pakistan.
Despite massive increases in aid dollars in recent years, including billions authorized by former President Barack Obama, those of us on the ground are largely cut out of the delivery process.
There are roughly 70 separate local aid offices and 40 international NGOs involved in providing aid to Pakistanis. But most decisions about how to spend the money they receive are made outside the country.
Aid recipient countries like Pakistan are at the bottom of the international development food chain.
Budgets are prepared in offices far from the intended site of delivery, and bilateral and multilateral programs often establish priorities (like health care, schooling, or poverty reduction) without much input from the receiving country.
Yet, because beneficiary governments are so hungry for aid dollars, they are usually all too eager to follow the agendas prepared by donors and their contractors. They say yes to the conditions and the studies and the evaluations.
And they acquiesce when told where and how to allocate funds. Local partners can only pick up the crumbs at the end of a long process involving too many “experts,” making recipients feel disenfranchised and unable to see a better future.
But, rather than simply cutting aid, as the Trump administration seems intent on doing, what the US should consider is reordering how – not if – it delivers aid.
And it is here, in the bottom-up approach being tested in parts of the Islamic world, that important lessons can be gleaned.
The void created by the shortcomings of Western aid programs has produced homegrown solutions in places like Pakistan, where socially minded, entrepreneurial religious leaders – mullahs – are increasingly making their presence felt.
These key community members offer Muslims a clearer vision of a better life than Western aid agencies ever could.
People relate to mullahs and believe in what they are offering. This trust is something Western donors have never placed a premium on earning.
In Pakistan, mullahs raise funds from their communities and from official and private donors in the wealthy oil-producing countries.
Unlike funding from, say, the US Agency for International Development, recipients are not burdened with consultancy fees or mandatory spending evaluations.
There are no policy matrices, controlled surveys, or field reports to file.
There is just cash, raised through a religious channel and funneled directly to the programs and communities that need it.
Throughout the Muslim world, self-motivated, entrepreneurial mullahs have operated without bureaucrats and hardship allowances, five-star hotels, or business-class tickets.
Not all of their efforts are altruistic; in a few instances, crowd-funding and informal networks have benefited terrorism.
Just like American voters who supported Trump, not every Muslim is an assiduous fact-checker.
But in the vast majority of cases, mullah-led efforts have raised cash for schools, hospitals, and other services that Western aid money has failed to deliver, while shaping how Muslim communities develop.
Demand for this alternative vision of aid has increased with the evident failure of the modernization-based development paradigm.
While Western experts peddling bureaucratized solutions enforced superficial modernity, based on dress, language, and lifestyles, many Muslims saw no real benefit in the form of expanded economic opportunity and greater social mobility.
So they sought, and established, their own solutions.
The economist William Easterly has argued that the best way to reform international development is to shift money from top-down “experts” to “bottom-up searchers – like Nobel Peace Prize winner and microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus – who keep experimenting until they find something that works for the poor on the ground.”
That, I would argue, is exactly what mullahs are doing in the Islamic world.
Development is most successful when it emerges from solutions that are identified, tested, and sustained locally, not when Western agencies and technocrats spend huge sums on top-down approaches.
Today, a new breed of Muslim “searchers” is offering bottom-up development solutions.
As the mullah-led development model continues to spread in the Muslim world, “experts” in the West would do well to understand the reasons for its success.

Where are the Global Problem Solvers?
NEW YORK – One odd and disturbing aspect of global politics today is the confusion between negotiations and problem-solving.
According to a timetable agreed in December 2007, we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in Copenhagen.
Governments are engaged in a massive negotiation, but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem-solving.
Each country asks itself, “How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the most?,” when they should be asking instead, “How do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit?”
These might sound like the same thing, but they are not.
Addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, which in turn involves choices in technology, some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed.
For example, coal plants, if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix, will need to capture and store their CO2, a process called “carbon capture and sequestration,” or CCS for short.
Yet this technology remains unproved.
Similarly, we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power, with plants that are safe and reliably monitored.
We will need new technologies to mobilize large-scale solar power, wind power, and geothermal power.
We might try to tap bio-fuels, but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets.
The list goes on.
We will need improved energy efficiency, through “green buildings” and more efficient appliances.
We will need to switch from cars with internal-combustion engines to hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery-powered, and fuel-cell-powered vehicles.
Achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development (such as improved batteries), a more robust electric grid, new infrastructure for re-charging the automobiles, and much more.
Similarly, it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal-fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide.
The switchover to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negotiation but of engineering, planning, financing, and incentives.
How can the world most effectively develop, demonstrate, and then spread these new technologies?
Where the benefits are unlikely to accrue to private investors, who should pay for the early demonstration models, which will require billions of dollars?
How should we preserve private incentives for research and development while committing to transfer successful technologies to developing countries?
These are pressing, unsolved questions.
Yet the global negotiations on climate change are focusing on a different set of questions.
The negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions, by how much, how fast, and relative to which baseline year.
Countries are being pressed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets, without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved.
The answers depend, of course, on which low-emission technologies will be available, and on how fast they can be deployed.
Consider the United States.
To cut emissions sharply, the US will need to switch over this decade to a new fleet of automobiles, powered increasingly by electricity.
The US will also have to decide on the renewal and expansion of its nuclear power plants, and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants, especially using solar power. And the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low-density population sites – such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power – to the high-density populations of the coasts.
Yet all of this requires a national plan, not simply a numerical target for emissions reduction.
Similarly, China, like the US, can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles. But China must consider the question from the vantage point of a coal-dependent economy.
China’s future choices depend on whether “clean coal” can really work effectively and on a large scale.
Thus, China’s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies.
A true global brainstorming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available, and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives.
The negotiations would discuss the range of options open to each country and region – from CCS to solar, wind, and nuclear power – and would sketch a timetable for a new generation of low-emission automobiles, recognizing that market competition as well as public financing will set the actual pace.
Based on these building blocks, the world could agree on allocating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low-emission technologies.
This global framework would underpin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological overhaul.
As new technologies are proven, the targets would become more stringent.
Of course, part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-emission technologies, so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right.
My plea to discuss plans and strategies alongside specific emissions targets might seem to risk impeding the negotiations. But if we don’t have a strategy to accompany our targets, the world’s governments might not accept such targets in the first place, or might accept them cynically, without any intention of actually meeting them.
We need to think hard, and collaboratively, about the world’s real technological options, and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era, one based on feasible and sustainable technologies for energy, transport, industry, and buildings.

Closing Developing Countries’ Capital Drain
NEW YORK – Developing countries are bracing for a major slowdown this year.
According to the UN report World Economic Situation and Prospects 2016, their growth averaged only 3.8% in 2015 – the lowest rate since the global financial crisis in 2009 and matched in this century only by the recessionary year of 2001.
And what is important to bear in mind is that the slowdown in China and the deep recessions in the Russian Federation and Brazil only explain part of the broad falloff in growth.
True, falling demand for natural resources in China (which accounts for nearly half of global demand for base metals) has had a lot to do with the sharp declines in these prices, which have hit many developing and emerging economies in Latin America and Africa hard.
Indeed, the UN report lists 29 economies that are likely to be badly affected by China’s slowdown.
And the collapse of oil prices by more than 60% since July 2014 has undermined the growth prospects of oil exporters.
The real worry, however, is not just falling commodity prices, but also massive capital outflows.
During 2009-2014, developing countries collectively received a net capital inflow of $2.2 trillion, partly owing to quantitative easing in advanced economies, which pushed interest rates there to near zero.
The search for higher yields drove investors and speculators to developing countries, where the inflows increased leverage, propped up equity prices, and in some cases supported a commodity price boom.
Market capitalization in the Mumbai, Johannesburg, São Paulo, and Shanghai stock exchanges, for example, nearly tripled in the years following the financial crisis.
Equity markets in other developing countries also witnessed similar dramatic increases during this period.
But the capital flows are now reversing, turning negative for the first time since 2006, with net outflows from developing countries in 2015 exceeding $600 billion – more than one-quarter of the inflows they received during the previous six years.
The largest outflows have been through banking channels, with international banks reducing their gross credit exposures to developing countries by more than $800 billion in 2015.
Capital outflows of this magnitude are likely to have myriad effects: drying up liquidity, increasing the costs of borrowing and debt service, weakening currencies, depleting reserves, and leading to decreases in equity and other asset prices.
There will be large knock-on effects on the real economy, including severe damage to developing countries’ growth prospects.
This is not the first time that developing countries have faced the challenges of managing pro-cyclical hot capital, but the magnitudes this time are overwhelming.
During the Asian financial crisis, net outflows from the East Asian economies were only $12 billion in 1997.
Of course, the East Asian economies today are better able to withstand such massive outflows, given their accumulation of international reserves since the financial crisis in 1997.
Indeed, the global stock of reserves has more than tripled since the Asian financial crisis.
China, for example, used nearly $500 billion of its reserves in 2015 to fight capital outflows and prevent the renminbi’s sharp depreciation; but it still has more than $3 trillion in reserves.
The stockpile of reserves may partly explain why huge outflows have not triggered a full-blown financial crisis in developing countries.
But not all countries are so fortunate to have a large arsenal.
Once again, advocates of free mobility for destabilizing short-term capital flows are being proven wrong.
Many emerging markets recognized the dangers and tried to reduce capital inflows.
South Korea, for example, has been using a series of macro-prudential measures since 2010, aimed at moderating pro-cyclical cross-border banking-sector liabilities.
The measures taken were only partially successful, as the data above show.
The question is, what should they do now?
Corporate sectors in developing countries, having increased their leverage with capital inflows during the post-2008 period, are particularly vulnerable.
Capital outflows will adversely affect their equity prices, push up their debt-to-equity ratios, and increase the likelihood of defaults.
The problem is especially severe in commodity-exporting developing economies, where firms borrowed extensively, expecting high commodity prices to persist.
Many developing-country governments failed to learn the lesson of earlier crises, which should have prompted regulations and taxes restricting and discouraging foreign-currency exposures.
Now governments need to take quick action to avoid becoming liable for these exposures.
Expedited debtor-friendly bankruptcy procedures could ensure quick restructuring and provide a framework for renegotiating debts.
Developing-country governments should also encourage the conversion of such debts to GDP-linked or other types of indexed bonds.
Those with high levels of foreign debt but with reserves should also consider buying back their sovereign debt in the international capital market, taking advantage of falling bond prices.
While reserves may provide some cushion for minimizing the adverse effects of capital outflows, in most cases they will not be sufficient.
Developing countries should resist the temptation of raising interest rates to stem capital outflows.
Historically, interest-rate hikes have had little effect.
In fact, because they hurt economic growth, further reducing countries’ ability to service external debts, higher interest rates can be counterproductive.
Macro-prudential measures can discourage or delay capital outflows, but such measures, too, may be insufficient.
In some cases, it may be necessary to introduce selective, targeted, and time-bound capital controls to stem outflows, especially outflows through banking channels.
This would entail, for example, restricting capital transfers between parent banks in developed countries and their subsidiaries or branches in developing countries.
Following the successful Malaysian example in 1997, developing countries could also temporarily suspend all capital withdrawals to stabilize capital flows and exchange rates.
This is perhaps the only recourse for many developing countries to avoid a catastrophic financial crisis.
It is important that they act soon.

Where Has All the Money Gone?
LONDON – Amid all the talk of when and how to end or reverse quantitative easing (QE), one question is almost never discussed: Why have central banks’ massive doses of bond purchases in Europe and the United States since 2009 had so little effect on the general price level?
Between 2009 and 2019, the Bank of England injected £425 billion ($588 billion) – about 22.5% of the United Kingdom’s 2012 GDP – into the UK economy. This was aimed at pushing up inflation to the BOE’s mandated medium-term target of 2%, from a low of just 1.1% in 2009.
But after ten years of QE, inflation was below its 2009 level, despite the fact that house and stock-market prices were booming, and GDP growth had not recovered to its pre-crisis trend rate.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the BOE has bought an additional £450 billion worth of UK government bonds, bringing the total to £875 billion, or 40% of current GDP.
The effects on inflation and output of this second round of QE are yet to be felt, but asset prices have again increased markedly.
A plausible generalization is that increasing the quantity of money through QE gives a big temporary boost to the prices of housing and financial securities, thus greatly benefiting the holders of these assets.
A small proportion of this increased wealth trickles through to the real economy, but most of it simply circulates within the financial system.
The standard Keynesian argument, derived from John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory, is that any economic collapse, whatever its cause, leads to a large increase in cash hoarding.
Money flows into reserves, and saving goes up, while spending goes down.
This is why Keynes argued that economic stimulus following a collapse should be carried out by fiscal rather than monetary policy.
Government has to be the “spender of last resort” to ensure that new money is used on production instead of being hoarded.
But in his Treatise on Money, Keynes provided a more realistic account based on the “speculative demand for money.”
During a sharp economic downturn, he argued, money is not necessarily hoarded, but flows from “industrial” to “financial” circulation.
Money in industrial circulation supports the normal processes of producing output, but in financial circulation it is used for “the business of holding and exchanging existing titles to wealth, including stock exchange and money market transactions.”
A depression is marked by a transfer of money from industrial to financial circulation – from investment to speculation.
So, the reason why QE has had hardly any effect on the general price level may be that a large part of the new money has fueled asset speculation, thus creating financial bubbles, while prices and output as a whole remained stable.
One implication of this is that QE generates its own boom-and-bust cycles.
Unlike orthodox Keynesians, who believed that crises were brought on by some external shock, the economist Hyman Minsky thought that the economic system could generate shocks through its own internal dynamics. Bank lending, Minsky argued, goes through three degenerative stages, which he dubbed hedge, speculation, and Ponzi.
At first, the borrower’s income needs to be sufficient to repay both the principal and interest on a loan.
Then, it needs to be high enough to meet only the interest payments.
And in the final stage, finance simply becomes a gamble that asset prices will rise enough to cover the lending.
When the inevitable reversal of asset prices produces a crash, the increase in paper wealth vanishes, dragging down the real economy in its wake.
Minsky would thus view QE as an example of state-created financial instability.
Today, there are already clear signs of mortgage-market excesses.
UK house prices increased by 10.2% in the year to March 2021, the highest rate of growth since August 2007, while indices of overvaluation in the US housing market are “flashing bright red.”
And an econometric study (so far unpublished) by Sandhya Krishnan of the Desai Academy of Economics in Mumbai shows no relationship between asset prices and goods prices in the UK and the US between 2000 and 2016.
So, it is hardly surprising that, in its February 2021 forecast, the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee estimated that there was a one-third chance of UK inflation falling below 0% or rising above 4% in the next few years.
This relatively wide range partly reflects uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic, but also a more basic uncertainty about the effects of QE itself.
In Margaret Atwood’s futuristic 2003 novel Oryx and Crake, HelthWyzer, a drug development center that manufactures premium-brand vitamin pills, inserts a virus randomly into its pills, hoping to profit from the sale of both the pills and the antidote it has developed for the virus.
The best type of diseases “from a business point of view,” explains Crake, a mad scientist, “would be those that cause lingering illness [...] the patient would either get well or die just before all of his or her money runs out.
It’s a fine calculation.”
With QE, we have invented a wonder drug that cures the macroeconomic diseases it causes.
That is why questions about the timing of its withdrawal are such “fine calculations.”
But the antidote is staring us in the face.
First, governments must abandon the fiction that central banks create money independently from government.
Second, they must themselves spend the money created at their behest.
For example, governments should not hoard the furlough funds that are set to be withdrawn as economic activity picks up, but instead use them to create public-sector jobs.
Doing this will bring about a recovery without creating financial instability. It is the only way to wean ourselves off our decade-long addiction to QE.

Kick-Starting Employment
BERKELEY – Unemployment is currently rising like a rocket, because businesses that normally would be expanding and hiring are not, and those businesses that would normally be contracting and shedding workers are doing so very rapidly.
Businesses that ought to be expanding and hiring cannot, because the depressed general level of financial asset prices prevents them from borrowing money or selling bonds on profitable terms.
In response, central banks should purchase government bonds for cash in as large a quantity as needed to push their prices up as high as possible.
Expensive government bonds will shift demand to mortgage or corporate bonds, pushing up their prices.
Even after central banks have pushed government bond prices as high as they can go, they should keep buying government bonds for cash, in the hope that people whose pockets are full of cash will spend more of it, and that this will directly pull people out of joblessness and into employment.
In addition, governments need to run extra-large deficits.
Spending – whether by the United States government during World War II, following the Reagan tax cuts of 1981, by Silicon Valley during the late 1990’s, or by home buyers in America’s south and on its coasts in the 2000’s – boosts employment and reduces unemployment. And government spending is as good as anybody else’s.
Finally, governments should undertake additional measures to boost financial asset prices, and so make it easier for those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring to obtain finance on terms that allow them to expand and hire.
It is this point that brings us to US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s plan to take about $465 billion of government money, combine it with $35 billion of private-sector money, and use it to buy up risky financial assets.
The US Treasury is asking the private sector to put $35 billion into this $500 billion fund so that the fund managers all have some “skin in the game,” and thus do not take excessive risks with the taxpayers’ money.
Private-sector investors ought to be more than willing to kick in that $35 billion, for they stand to make a fortune when financial asset prices close some of the gap between their current and normal values.
If the fund does well over the next five years – returns profits of 9% per year –private investors get a market rate of return on their very risky equity investment and the equivalent of an “annual management fee” equal to 2% of assets under management.
If the portfolio does less well – profits of 4% per year – the managers still get a healthy but sub-market return of 10% per year on their equity. And if the portfolio does badly – loses 1% per year – they lose roughly 70% of their investment.
Those are attractive odds.
Time alone will tell whether the financiers who invest in and run this program make a fortune. But if they do, they will make the US government an even bigger fortune.
And 2% of assets under management is an annual fee that many sophisticated investors have been willing to pay private hedge funds – topped off with an extra fee of 20% of annual profits, which the Treasury is not paying.
The fact that the Geithner Plan is likely to be profitable for the US government is, however, a sideshow.
The aim is to reduce unemployment.
The appearance of an extra $500 billion in demand for risky assets will reduce the quantity of risky assets that other private investors will have to hold. And the sudden appearance of between five and ten different government-sponsored funds that make public bids for assets will convey information to the markets about what models other people are using to try to value assets in this environment.
This sharing of information will reduce risk – somewhat.
When assets are seen as less risky, their prices rise. And when there are fewer assets to be held, their prices rise, too.
With higher financial asset prices, those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring will be able to get money on more attractive terms.
The problem is that the Geithner Plan appears to me to be too small – between one-eight and one-half of what it needs to be.
Even though the US government is doing other things as well –fiscal stimulus, quantitative easing, and other uses of bailout funds – it is not doing everything it should.
My guess is that the reason that the US government is not doing all it should can be stated in three words: Senator George Voinovich, who is the 60th vote in the Senate – the vote needed to close off debate and enact a bill.
To do anything that requires legislative action, the Obama administration needs Voinovich and the 59 other senators who are more inclined to support it.
The administration’s tacticians appear to think that they are not on board – especially after the recent AIG bonus scandal – whereas the Geithner Plan relies on authority that the administration already has.
Doing more would require a legislative coalition that is not there yet.

The Hollow Heart of the West
BERLIN – It is tempting to compare NATO and the European Union to the French and Italian football teams in this year’s Euro 2008 competition.
What unites them, above all, is a process of “competitive decadence.”
The EU and NATO may see themselves as potential rivals or complementary partners in the field of defense.
But what their leaders say in private reveals a sense of common frustration.
“We fail to translate military presence into political influence,” says the NATO person, who sounds very much like EU representatives commenting on the Union’s role in the Middle East. “We have failed to transform economic aid into political influence,” they lament.
The crises that the two institutions now face in the wake of Ireland’s vote against the Lisbon Treaty and the deterioration of security in Afghanistan are of course very different.
Yet both are ultimately identity crises.
Both NATO and the EU have been forced to redefine how they function and rethink their purposes after a dual process of enlargement.
From that standpoint, the challenge confronting NATO may be even more difficult, for enlarging the security organization not only means taking on new members, but also exercising new “out of area” responsibilities.
Moving from the North Atlantic to Afghanistan, and from deterrence to combat, has proved to be a major challenge for NATO – a test that may prove harder than the disappearance of the Soviet Union nearly 20 years ago.
Can NATO survive defeat in Afghanistan?
The question is far from abstract.
The challenge posed by Afghanistan was underestimated from the start, and the Alliance has under-resourced it.
The lack of a clear plan – is the goal to defeat Al Qaeda or to create democracy? – remains problematic, but less so in the short term than the lack of adequate resources.
Indeed, while Afghanistan is the size of France, NATO has sent the same number of troops as it has in tiny Bosnia.
The war in Iraq has not only caused NATO to lose focus in Afghanistan; it has also undermined solidarity of purpose among allies.
And, without confronting much more seriously the “sanctuary” role unwillingly played by Pakistan, there is no solution ahead for NATO in Afghanistan.
The other major problem facing NATO is linked to the United States’ loss of the moral high ground.
In the artistic imagination of Europeans, America has become associated more with servitude than with freedom.
In the Berlin Opera’s latest version of Beethoven’s Fidelio, the prisoners seemed to be coming out of Guantánamo.
The Afghan quagmire and America’s image are not the only problems facing NATO.
The organization has to redefine its purpose, particularly its relationship with a resurgent Russia.
NATO’s aim cannot simply be, to use Lord Ismay’s famous formula, “to keep America in, Russia out and Germany down.”
By losing its geographic focus, NATO is now confronted with a major identity challenge.
Is it to become a “league of democracy”?
If so, it must consider having a special relationship with countries like India and Japan, to name a few.
If it is to remain a “Western Alliance” in a “globalized” world, must it define a much clearer relationship with Russia without giving the Kremlin a veto in the Alliance?
Or will NATO eventually become an “alliance for stability” that includes all the new powers – China, India, and Brazil, not to mention Russia – of the emerging “multi-polar world”?
One thing is certain; a “shrinking West,” as long as it retains some influence, must create the best institutions it can during the time it still has.
In essence, the EU’s fundamental dilemma is not that different from NATO’s.
It has succeeded so well that it has taken on new members and new responsibilities, but has lost focus and clarity of purpose.
What is Europe’s project today?
Where does the EU end?
It no longer dreams of becoming the “United States of Europe,” and Jacques Delors’ suggestion of “the United Nations of Europe” has remained too ambivalent, if not deliberately ambiguous, to be effective.
After the Irish “No,” can the Union find salvation in NATO’s idea of a “coalition of the willing”?
Can the most determined pro-integration Europeans leave the pack without being paralyzed by the coalition of the unwilling?
Of course, the Irish “No” is not the equivalent for the EU of what the Afghan quagmire represents for NATO.
Yet it also constitutes a major setback and challenge of an institutional, political, and even psychological nature.
How do you recreate a European “narrative” that reconciles the Union with its citizens?
The EU has lately failed – far more than NATO has – not only to win hearts, but also to convince Europeans that in a global world, it is part of the solution, not part of the problem.

Relearning to Love the Bomb
WASHINGTON, DC – The shocking thing about nuclear weapons is that they seem to have lost their power to shock.
While the nuclear deal that was just reached with Iran in Lausanne might suggest otherwise and is very good news, that effort should not obscure the bad news elsewhere.
The momentum toward a nuclear-weapon-free world driven by US President Barack Obama’s landmark 2009 speech in Prague, having faltered for the last few years, has now gone into sharp reverse.
When Russia annexed Crimea last year, President Vladimir Putin announced his readiness to put Russian nuclear forces on alert, and even signaled plans to “surprise the West with our new developments in offensive nuclear weapons.”
The world barely stirred.
Meanwhile, China and India are steadily increasing the size of their nuclear arsenals, and Pakistan is doing so even faster, even spelling out plans to combine battlefield nukes with conventional weapons.
Again, the world shrugs.
For its part, the United States plans to spend $355 billion upgrading and modernizing its vast nuclear arsenal over the next ten years.
Far from moving toward disarmament, the intention seems to be to maintain and enhance every component of America’s current land, sea, and airborne nuclear capability.
There was more amusement than alarm at a conference of 800 nuclear specialists in Washington, DC, in March, when a senior Air Force general, eerily channeling George C. Scott in “Dr. Strangelove,” offered a nostrils-bared defense of “an ability to allow no adversary to have sanctuary anywhere in the world.”
Spooked by Russia’s incursions into Ukraine, North Korea’s erratic intransigence, and China’s new foreign-policy assertiveness, US allies and partners in East Asia and Europe have rushed back to unthinking embrace of Cold War assumptions about the deterrent utility of nuclear weapons and their central importance in security policy.
As my colleagues and I put it in our book-length report Nuclear Weapons: The State of Play 2015, launched in Geneva, Vienna, and Washington in March: “On the evidence of the size of their weapons arsenals, fissile material stocks, force modernization plans, stated doctrine and known deployment practices, all nine nuclear-armed states foresee indefinite retention of nuclear weapons and a continuing role for them in their security policies.”
All of this has serious implications for the five-year review conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), scheduled to begin in New York in late April.
The NPT has been the single most crucial factor in limiting the world’s nuclear-armed states to the current nine, rather than the 20-30 widely feared a generation ago.
But its credibility now hangs by a thread.
The NPT, after all, is based on a bargain: states that do not possess nuclear weapons promise not to acquire them, in exchange for a pledge by those that do to move seriously toward eliminating their arsenals.
And recent developments have once again jeopardized that bargain, with many states again asking why, if the US, Russia, and others need nuclear weapons, they do not.
Given such sentiments, it will prove almost impossible at the review conference to build a consensus in favor of further necessary strengthening of the non-proliferation regime, with improved safeguards, export controls, security disciplines, and sanctions against withdrawal from the treaty.
The irrationality of such resistance is not likely to weaken it.
Not all the news is bleak.
Aside from the Iran negotiations, other arms control cooperation is continuing, including between the US and Russia over the New START treaty to reduce strategic deployments, and over chemical weapons in Syria.
Despite lack of any visible progress toward ridding the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction, the signs are encouraging that Egypt and others in the region want to keep trying, and will not use the issue of a WMD-free zone to blow up the review conference, as had been feared.
Most encouraging of all, a major new international movement is gathering pace to focus policy attention on the horrific humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, and to create the conditions for a treaty to ban them once and for all.
Since 2012, major conferences have been hosted by Norway, Mexico, and Austria, and more than 155 states have pledged support for appropriate action, with only the nuclear-armed states and their allies and partners dragging their feet.
The nuclear-armed states will not sign on any time soon to any treaty that bans the use of their weapons under all circumstances.
They will resist even more strongly the outright elimination of their weapons, given that the world is probably still decades away from devising sufficient verification and enforcement measures.
But if the NPT review conference is not to end in tears, with all the accompanying risks for world order that failure would entail, the five nuclear-armed states that are NPT signatories can and must be prepared to bring more to the table than they have so far.
Baby steps – improving their transparency in reporting, or agreeing on the meaning of technical terms like “strategic,” “deployed,” and “reserve” – will not begin to satisfy the many NPT countries that have been appalled by the recent re-emergence of Cold War mindsets and behavior.
The nuclear-armed states can and should make serious commitments to dramatic further reductions in the size of their arsenals; hold the number of weapons physically deployed and ready for immediate launch to an absolute minimum; and change their strategic doctrines to limit the role and salience of nuclear weapons, ideally by committing to “no first use.”
Most important, they should agree on indicative target dates – from five to 15 years – for achieving all of these initial objectives.
Deadlines have been indispensable for achieving sustainable-development and carbon-reduction goals: saving the world from the threat of nuclear annihilation is hardly a less urgent and important objective.

Two Energy Futures
By 2100, the world’s energy system will be radically different from today’s. Renewable energy like solar, wind, hydroelectricity, and biofuels will make up a large share of the energy mix, and nuclear energy, too, will have a place.
Humans will have found ways of dealing with air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
New technologies will have reduced the amount of energy needed to power buildings and vehicles.
Indeed, the distant future looks bright, but much depends on how we get there.
There are two possible routes.
Let’s call the first scenario Scramble . Like an off-road rally through a mountainous desert, it promises excitement and fierce competition.
However, the unintended consequence of “more haste” will often be “less speed,” and many will crash along the way.
The alternative scenario can be called Blueprints , which resembles a cautious ride, with some false starts, on a road that is still under construction.
Whether we arrive safely at our destination depends on the discipline of the drivers and the ingenuity of all those involved in the construction effort.
Technological innovation provides the excitement.
Regardless of which route we choose, the world’s current predicament limits our room to maneuver.
We are experiencing a step-change in the growth rate of energy demand due to rising population and economic development.
After 2015, easily accessible supplies of oil and gas probably will no longer keep up with demand.
As a result, we will have no choice but to add other sources of energy – renewables, yes, but also more nuclear power and unconventional fossil fuels such as oil sands.
Using more energy inevitably means emitting more CO2 at a time when climate change has become a critical global issue.
In the Scramble scenario, nations rush to secure energy resources for themselves, fearing that energy security is a zero-sum game, with clear winners and losers.
The use of local coal and homegrown biofuels increases fast.
Taking the path of least resistance, policymakers pay little attention to curbing energy consumption – until supplies run short.
Likewise, despite much rhetoric, greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until major shocks trigger political reactions.
Since these responses are overdue, they are severe and lead to energy price spikes and volatility.
The Blueprints scenario is less painful, even if the start is more disorderly.
Numerous coalitions emerge to take on the challenges of economic development, energy security, and environmental pollution through cross-border cooperation.
Much innovation occurs at the local level, as major cities develop links with industry to reduce local emissions.
National governments introduce efficiency standards, taxes, and other policy instruments to improve the environmental performance of buildings, vehicles, and transport fuels.
Moreover, as calls for harmonization increase, policies converge across the globe. Cap-and-trade mechanisms that put a price on industrial CO2 emissions gain international acceptance.
Rising CO2 prices in turn accelerate innovation, spawning breakthroughs.
A growing number of cars are powered by electricity and hydrogen, while industrial facilities are fitted with technology to capture CO2 and store it underground.
Against the backdrop of these two equally plausible scenarios, we will know only in a few years whether December’s Bali declaration on climate change was just rhetoric or the start of a global effort to counter it.
Much will depend on how attitudes evolve in China, the European Union, India, and the United States.
Shell traditionally uses its scenarios to prepare for the future without expressing a preference for one over another.
But, faced with the need to manage climate risk for our investors and our descendants, we believe the Blueprints outcomes provide the best balance between economy, energy, and environment.
For a second opinion, we appealed to climate change calculations made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
These calculations indicate that a Blueprints world with CO2 capture and storage results in the least amount of climate change, provided emissions of other major manmade greenhouse gases are similarly reduced.
But the Blueprints scenario will be realized only if policymakers agree on a global approach to emissions trading and actively promote energy efficiency and new technology in four sectors: heat and power generation, industry, transport, and buildings.
This will require hard work, and time is short.
For example, Blueprints assumes CO2 is captured at 90% of all coal- and gas-fired power plants in developed countries by 2050, plus at least 50% of those in non-OECD countries. Today, none capture CO2.
Because CO2 capture and storage adds costs and yields no revenues, government support is needed to make it happen quickly on a scale large enough to affect global emissions.
At the least, companies should earn carbon credits for the CO2 they capture and store.
Blueprints will not be easy.
But it offers the world the best chance of reaching a sustainable energy future unscathed, so we should explore this route with the same ingenuity and persistence that put humans on the moon and created the digital age.
The world faces a long voyage before it reaches a low-carbon energy system.
Companies can suggest possible routes to get there, but governments are in the driver’s seat.
And governments will determine whether we should prepare for bitter competition or a true team effort.

Buying into Bitcoin
LONDON – The Internet currency Bitcoin is surrounded by uncertainty.
Is it a speculative bubble?
Is it really as anonymous as its proponents claim?
Can one actually use it to purchase the legendary White Widow strain of marijuana, or to hire a hit man?
These are certainly interesting questions, but they are diverting attention from far more important discussions about Bitcoin’s potential to drive financial-sector innovation.
Bitcoin is so innovative, in fact, that beyond breaking the conventions of currency, it has even transcended partisan ideologies.
Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and US Tea Party icon Ron Paul are diametrically opposed on virtually every issue but Bitcoin (both deeply dislike it).
And yet Bitcoin’s opponents should be asking how the groundbreaking ideas that underlie it could be applied to reforming the global financial system.
Although the 2008 financial crisis exposed profound institutional shortcomings, the response – including heightened regulatory safeguards like the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and the Basel III banking standards – has failed to bring about the needed transformation.
Likewise, protest movements like Occupy Wall Street, aimed at raising awareness of – and ultimately reforming – the culture of finance, have delivered mixed results.
But the fact is that no one – except perhaps the small coterie of financial insiders who have benefited enormously from taxpayer-financed bailouts – should be satisfied with the current system, not least because another crisis, most likely accompanied by more bank bailouts, can reasonably be expected in the not-so-distant future.
While the exact timing of the next meltdown cannot be known, one thing is certain: consideration of what kind of financial system would best serve the world in the twenty-first century would be incomplete without Bitcoin.
After all, the technology behind it could not only help to reduce systemic risk by creating safeguards shielding the payments system from useful but unpredictable financial activities; it could also play an important role in bolstering much-needed economic growth.
Financial institutions essentially act as matchmakers, linking investors, borrowers, and savers, and recording what people own and owe.
In exchange for these services, financial professionals are compensated very generously.
So, to ask whether bankers’ massive paychecks are fair is really to ask how much value is created by financial matchmaking – a question to which there is no simple answer.
What is clear is that, by allowing a greater proportion of an economy’s wealth to be channeled toward investment and other productive economic activities, a more efficient financial-services industry boosts economic growth.
In other words, the financial-services industry can be viewed as a kind of tax on the rest of the economy. And, given the high costs of financial systems that are antiquated, costly, and inefficient – in London, for example, paper checks must physically be sent from one bank to another, meaning that it takes 5-6 days for the funds to be transferred – the smaller the financial system, the better off everyone else will be.
The inefficiency of the world’s financial system is not simply a result of obsolete rules and structures; profit-seeking is also a major factor.
While British authorities recently announced that the transfer of physical checks would be abolished, a two-day check-clearing delay will remain.
Given that scanned images of checks could easily be processed electronically almost instantaneously, the enduring delay can be explained only by “float” – that is, the interest earned by holding onto money for as long as possible.
Float is just one of the many ways the financial-services industry extracts resources from the economy.
The 3-5% charge levied by credit-card companies works out to several hundred billion dollars in annual profits for companies like Visa and MasterCard.
Fees for wire transfers and for exchanging currency can quickly climb to 10% or more per transaction, with interruptions and complex procedures making such services even more costly.
But there is reason for hope.
With the innovations pioneered by Bitcoin, the fees, delays, and other inefficiencies that serve to line the pockets of those in the financial-services industry can largely be eliminated.
Ahead of US Senate hearings last November, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to senators saying that Bitcoin may “hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure, and more efficient payment system.”
As if on cue, the US retail giant Target was hacked – another episode in a long string of major financial-data heists.
Bitcoin, with its capacity for anonymity, could certainly help to make the global financial system more secure, saving consumers and businesses significant inconvenience and expense.
At the same time, it offers an alternative store of value, and its use as a medium of exchange is steadily growing.
But perhaps the most exciting innovation offered by Bitcoin is the “blockchain” – peer-to-peer software that keeps a record of all transactions and a tally of who owns what.
The blockchain essentially serves the “ledger” function that banks do today, but at a fraction of the cost to consumers and businesses.
Powered by an open-source algorithm and maintained by anyone who chooses to download the free software, Bitcoin marks a return to a community-based approach to money and banking, with financial services more closely connected to the people who use them.
Large, monolithic third-party managers like today’s “too big to fail” banks would be cut out.
Indeed, with software like the blockchain powering a new financial architecture, “the people” would effectively become the bank.
Bitcoin and its ecosystem are still maturing, and only time will tell if current price levels reflect a speculative bubble. But the innovations pioneered by Bitcoin can – and therefore should – play a transformative role in building a safer, less expensive, and more effective financial system.

Europe’s Short Vacation
NEW YORK – Since last November, the European Central Bank, under its new president, Mario Draghi, has reduced its policy rates and undertaken two injections of more than €1 trillion of liquidity into the eurozone banking system.
This led to a temporary reduction in the financial strains confronting the debt endangered countries on the eurozone’s periphery (Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland), sharply lowered the risk of a liquidity run in the eurozone banking system, and cut financing costs for Italy and Spain from their unsustainable levels of last fall.
At the same time, a technical default by Greece was avoided, and the country implemented a successful – if coercive – restructuring of its public debt.
A new fiscal compact – and new governments in Greece, Italy, and Spain – spurred hope of credible commitment to austerity and structural reform.
And the decision to combine the eurozone’s new bailout fund (the European Stability Mechanism) with the old one (the European Financial Stability Facility) significantly increased the size of the eurozone’s firewall.
But the ensuing honeymoon with the markets turned out to be brief.
Interest-rate spreads for Italy and Spain are widening again, while borrowing costs for Portugal and Greece remained high all along.
And, inevitably, the recession on the eurozone’s periphery is deepening and moving to the core, namely France and Germany.
Indeed, the recession will worsen throughout this year, for many reasons.
First, front-loaded fiscal austerity – however necessary – is accelerating the contraction, as higher taxes and lower government spending and transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand.
Moreover, as the recession deepens, resulting in even wider fiscal deficits, another round of austerity will be needed.
And now, thanks to the fiscal compact, even the eurozone’s core will be forced into front-loaded recessionary austerity.
Moreover, while über-competitive Germany can withstand a euro at – or even stronger than – $1.30, for the eurozone’s periphery, where unit labor costs rose 30-40% during the last decade, the value of the exchange rate would have to fall to parity with the US dollar to restore competitiveness and external balance.
After all, with painful deleveraging – spending less and saving more to reduce debts – depressing domestic private and public demand, the only hope of restoring growth is an improvement in the trade balance, which requires a much weaker euro.
Meanwhile, the credit crunch in the eurozone periphery is intensifying: thanks to the ECB long-term cheap loans, banks there don’t have a liquidity problem now, but they do have a massive capital shortage.
Faced with the difficulty of meeting their 9% capital-ratio requirement, they will achieve the target by selling assets and contracting credit – not exactly an ideal scenario for economic recovery.
To make matters worse, the eurozone depends on oil imports even more than the United States does, and oil prices are rising, even as the political and policy environment is deteriorating.
France may elect a president who opposes the fiscal compact and whose policies may scare the bond markets.
Elections in Greece – where the recession is turning into a depression – may give 40-50% of the popular vote to parties that favor immediate default and exit from the eurozone.
Irish voters may reject the fiscal compact in a referendum.
And there are signs of austerity and reform fatigue both in Spain and Italy, where demonstrations, strikes, and popular resentment against painful austerity are mounting.
Even structural reforms that will eventually increase productivity growth can be recessionary in the short run.
Increasing labor-market flexibility by reducing the costs of shedding workers will lead – in the short run – to more layoffs in the public and private sector, exacerbating the fall in incomes and demand.
Finally, after a good start, the ECB has now placed on hold the additional monetary stimulus that the eurozone needs.
Indeed, ECB officials are starting to worry aloud about the rise in inflation due to the oil shock.
The trouble is that the eurozone has an austerity strategy but no growth strategy.
And, without that, all it has is a recession strategy that makes austerity and reform self-defeating, because, if output continues to contract, deficit and debt ratios will continue to rise to unsustainable levels.
Moreover, the social and political backlash eventually will become overwhelming.
That is why interest-rate spreads in the eurozone periphery are widening again now.
The peripheral countries suffer from severe stock and flow imbalances.
The stock imbalances include large and rising public and private debt as a share of GDP.
The flow imbalances include a deepening recession, massive loss of external competitiveness, and the large external deficits that markets are now unwilling to finance.
Without a much easier monetary policy and a less front-loaded mode of fiscal austerity, the euro will not weaken, external competitiveness will not be restored, and the recession will deepen.
And, without resumption of growth – not years down the line, but in 2012 – the stock and flow imbalances will become even more unsustainable.
More eurozone countries will be forced to restructure their debts, and eventually some will decide to exit the monetary union.

The Retreat of the Renminbi
NEW YORK – “The globalization of the yuan seems remorseless and unstoppable,” pronounced The Economist in April 2014.
Indeed, use of the Chinese yuan, or renminbi (RMB), in global payments would double between then and August 2015, to 2.8% of the total, making China’s currency the fourth most used in the world.
Since then, however, this growth has been almost entirely reversed.
The RMB’s share in global payments has fallen to 1.6%, knocking it down to number seven.
Its use in global bond markets is down 45% from its 2015 peak.
RMB deposits in Hong Kong banks are also down by half.
And whereas 35% of China’s cross-border trade was settled in RMB in 2015 (with most of the remainder in dollars), that share has fallen to about 12% today.
The RMB’s reversal of fortune reflects four factors in particular.
For starters, whereas the dollar value of the RMB rose nearly every year from 2005 to 2013 – by 36.7% in total – it has since fallen steadily, discouraging speculators.
Since 2014, the exchange rate has weakened by an increasing amount every year, and is now down over 11% since the drop began, despite intervention by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to support the currency (not to hold it down, as US President Donald Trump has alleged).
As a result, investors have abandoned the idea that RMB appreciation is a one-way bet. Capital inflows driven by that bet are over.
The RMB’s fall against the dollar reflects the slowing of China’s debt-fueled economic growth and the accumulation of default risks.
Chinese residents and companies are, not surprisingly, seeking new ways (legal and otherwise) to move money out of the country.
In April, PBOC Deputy Governor Yi Gang tried to reassure nervous investors in a presentation in New York by saying that the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the Chinese banking sector had “pretty much stabilized after a long time of climbing.”
This was, he said, “a good development in the financial market.”
But Yi was spinning.
NPLs have stabilized as a percentage of total bank loans, but only because the number of loans has continued to rise.
Many of these new loans are to deadbeat clients, and can be expected to go sour in due course.
In fact, in absolute terms, NPLs grew by $35 billion in 2016, reaching $220 billion.
Banks are also using accounting tricks to hide trillions in further exposures.
In an effort to stem the weakening of the exchange rate, the authorities have made it more difficult to convert RMB to dollars.
Having previously supported Chinese investment abroad, they are now blocking outbound mergers and acquisitions to keep domestic companies from exporting capital.
They have simultaneously made capital repatriation more difficult for foreign investors.
While this helps keep existing capital in China, it is also discouraging foreigners from committing more.
This is the second factor discouraging accumulation of the Chinese currency.
Faced with the choice between short-term economic stability and currency flexibility, Chinese policymakers are choosing stability.
This raises questions about their long-term commitment to full convertibility, an important step for the RMB to reach genuine reserve-currency status.
The third factor undermining the RMB is that China has exhausted its export potential.
The country and its currency have gained prominence because of China’s extraordinary integration into the global economy since its admission into the World Trade Organization in 2001.
China’s share of world exports grew from 1% in 1980 to 14% in 2015, making it the world’s largest exporter.
But its share of global exports has since fallen, to 13.3%.
Those who saw China as the national equivalent of Amazon.com, selling more to more people year on year, have been disappointed.
The fourth factor is the reversal of globalization itself.
Capital flows – in the form of equity and bond purchases, foreign direct investment, and lending – fell by over two thirds, from $11.9 trillion to $3.3 trillion, between 2007 and 2015.
Trade barriers are up.
Discriminatory measures are spreading faster than liberalizing policies.
Merchandise trade is falling, too, contracting 10% between 2011 and 2015, which was the largest drop over any four-year period since World War II.
China is therefore not only losing export-market share, but is doing so in a shrinking global market.
As a consequence, the dollar value of China’s exports has fallen by 9.1% since its peak in early 2015.
The net result is that, compared to just a few years ago, the world has little, if any, reason to continue accumulating RMB.
The globalization of the RMB is no longer “remorseless and unstoppable.” On the contrary, it appears, for the foreseeable future, to be well and truly over.

From Red to Green?

Reviving the WTO
WASHINGTON, DC – The World Trade Organization is in the news mostly for the wrong reasons nowadays.
Many people regard it as an ineffective policeman of an outdated rulebook that is unsuited for the challenges of the twenty-first-century global economy.
And WTO members generally agree that the organization urgently needs reforming in order to remain relevant.
Recent months have brought further challenges. The WTO’s appellate body, which adjudicates trade disputes among member countries, effectively ceased functioning last December amid disagreements regarding the appointment of new judges to the panel.
And in May 2020, Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he would step down at the end of August, a year before his current term was due to end.
Whoever Azevêdo’s successor is will face a major challenge. Since its establishment in 1995, the WTO has failed to conclude a single trade-negotiation round of global trade talks, thus missing an opportunity to deliver mutual benefits for its members.
The Doha Development Round, which began in November 2001, was supposed to be concluded by January 2005.
Fifteen years later, WTO members are still debating whether the Doha process should continue.
Some think it has been overtaken by events, while others want to pursue further negotiations.
The WTO has so far delivered disappointingly few other notable agreements as well, apart from the Trade Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force in February 2017, and the 2015 decision to eliminate all forms of agricultural export subsidies.
Meanwhile, some of its members have worked together on a raft of much broader regional trade deals that cover pressing issues such as the digital economy, investment, competition, the environment, and climate change.
The Doha Development Round, which was intended to modernize the WTO’s rulebook, covers very few of these topics.
And even some of the organization’s existing rules can easily be circumvented, thereby upsetting the balance of rights and obligations among members.
During the current COVID-19 crisis, for example, some countries have imposed questionable export controls on medical supplies and food products in order to mitigate shortages.
But despite these challenges, the WTO has not been a “failure.” Rather, it has built upon the successes of its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which entered into force in 1948.
The rules-based multilateral trading system that began with GATT has contributed immensely to global economic growth over the last seven decades, by reducing average tariffs and steadily eliminating non-tariff barriers.
As a result, living standards have improved in most countries.
Moreover, rules-based global trade has helped to underpin peace and security, because trading partners are more likely to resolve differences through negotiations than through armed conflict.
Nonetheless, WTO members today recognize the need to reboot the organization for the twenty-first century.
Developed countries believe that they have shouldered the burden of trade liberalization for far too long, and that developing countries should shoulder more obligations if they are in a position to do so.
Least-developed and low-income developing countries, meanwhile, say that WTO rules are hampering their efforts to grow and modernize their economies.
Over the last two decades, international trade has become a bogeyman for critics who blame it for the economic woes some countries face. But trade is not a zero-sum game: rights and obligations can be balanced, as the evolution of global and regional trading rules since 1948 has shown.
The question facing the WTO and its members now, therefore, is how to make progress and reach mutually beneficial agreements.
All members should participate in this endeavor, because that is the only way the organization can regain its credibility and carry out its rule-making function.
New negotiations must therefore take account of members’ varying levels of economic development, and aim – as ever – to reach fair and equitable agreements.
Other crucial priorities for the WTO include enhanced transparency, in the form of timely notifications of countries’ trade measures, and an effective dispute-settlement system that commands the confidence of all members.
A moribund WTO does not serve any country’s interest.
An effective, rules-based international trade system is a public good, and failure to revive it will undermine governments’ efforts to pull the global economy out of the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The WTO has an irreplaceable role to play in transforming countries’ economic prospects and the lives of people around the world.
Although the current crisis has brought the organization’s deteriorating health into sharp focus, its further decline is not inevitable.
In a world economy already imperiled by COVID-19, we must now apply the antidote – members’ political will, determination, and flexibility – needed to revive it.

Thailand in Denial
BANGKOK – Thailand’s political and social fabric is fraying.
Indeed, the country’s future looks as shaky as it has never been.
In other prosperous democracies, the middle class provides the glue that holds society together.
In Thailand, by contrast, the bourgeoisie, centered in Bangkok, is barely emerging as a social and political force.
Instead, for a half-century, an unspoken social contract among four broad groups has held Thailand together: the “Palace” – a euphemism used here to avoid violating draconian lèse majesté laws; big business, the custodian of economic growth; the military, which ensures, first and foremost, the sanctity of the Palace and the moral values it represents; and the common people, mostly rural and urban poor, who accept the rule of the other three estates.
Thailand’s national mythology is that it is a happy Buddhist country, a “land of smiles” bound together by compassion and harmony under the benevolent grace and blessings of the Palace and the generosity of big business.
The less fortunate classes are docile, content to accept their subservient roles and satisfied with the social welfare, no matter how skimpy, provided by their betters.
The poor and the military hold the Palace in genuine reverence.
Palace staff and people in the countryside kneel before the monarchy not merely as a matter of protocol, but out of genuine love and respect.
Forbes magazine ranked the Thai monarchy in 2009 as the richest of all the world’s royals, putting its net worth at $30 billion – a figure that locals consider too low.
That royal wealth necessarily entails substantial investments in and with Thai big business in all sectors of the economy.
Thailand’s blue-chip firms gain much from direct involvement with the Palace and from social proximity to it.
One Hong Kong scion whose wife is from an elite Thai family estimates that perhaps 20 families control most of Thai business.
The Thai military is constitutionally subordinate to civilian leadership, but in reality it owes its allegiance to the Palace.
In the current crisis, army generals have told the public that they are reluctant to use force, a position that was not theirs to take.
How long this inactivity will last is anyone’s guess.
Mobs wearing red shirts to symbolize their loyalty to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra are now camped out in two major commercial areas, paralyzing a large part of the local economy.
They demand that the government dissolve the current legislature immediately, and that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva resign because he was never elected and is viewed as a front man for the traditional anti-Thaksin monied groups.
Many believe that the current crisis will pass, and that Thailand will revert to its historical harmony among the four groups. But this view ignores the country’s new political dynamics.
First and foremost, Thailand’s lower classes have decided that docility is a thing of the past.
They are angry and frustrated by the status quo.
Save for the handouts they got under Thaksin, they benefited little from the economic growth of the past three decades.
The vast gap between the urban rich and the rest has grown worse over the years, with no discernible “trickle-down” effect.
Even in the prime commercial districts and chic neighborhoods of Bangkok, the nation’s richest city, a short walk reveals miles of cracked pavements, piles of uncollected garbage, and rats scurrying freely.
Such wrenching sights are typically accompanied by the pungent odor of a sewage system that is more a problem than a solution, especially during the rainy season.
The sight of run-down physical infrastructure, punctuated by super-modern shopping malls with global consumer brand names well beyond the purchasing power of most citizens, is not what you would expect in an economy once described as a potential Asian Dragon.
The wealthy dwell in air-conditioned houses, travel in chauffeur-driven cars, and shop in luxury malls, apparently oblivious to how the rest of the country lives.
Poor rural families see too many of their children become prostitutes in order to survive.
The poor view the coup against Thaksin of 2006, and the later disbanding of his party, as revenge by the traditional elites who wanted the old ways back, and who would get what they wanted by force since they could no longer get it through the ballot box.
It is a view that is not entirely wrong.
In late 2008, anti-Thaksin mobs wearing yellow shirts and led by prominent business figures occupied Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi International Airport with impunity, seeking to annul the result of a general election in which pro-Thaksin forces gained power, despite Thaksin’s exile overseas.
Yellow is the color of Thai royalty, and the Palace was believed to be sympathetic to the mobs.
Now Thaksin loyalists – the “red shirts” – are doing much the same, demanding change through mob behavior.
They believe that they, too, are entitled to act with impunity.
The red shirts are not blind to Thaksin’s excessive corruption. But they see him as a rare Thai politician who actually bothered to connect with them.
Moreover, as prime minister, Thaksin made a point of delivering much-needed services to the underclasses: subsidized medical care and micro-loans to name just two.
But the unspoken issue behind Thailand’s unrest is that, with the country’s 82-year-old king ailing, the Palace’s moral force has come into question.
Indeed, Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Pirmoya, breaking taboos that have governed the country for years, recently spoke about the need to re-examine the country’s lèse majesté laws so that public discourse could intelligently address the role of the Palace in Thailand’s future.
What Thaksin did for the poor required only political self-interest.
Yet even that elementary wisdom has never occurred to traditional ruling elites too set in their myopic and arrogant ways.
Until it does, Thailand’s otherwise promising future will be increasingly remote.

The Myth of “Eurabia”
LONDON – There is a powerful narrative today about how many young European Muslims are susceptible to terrorism, how Islam leads to radicalization, and how Muslims, because of their creed, choose to live in ghettos and therefore create swamps that breed terrorists.
This narrative’s most extreme form is the idea of “Eurabia,” an incendiary term that purportedly describes a phenomenon by which Muslim hordes are now contaminating Europe’s very DNA.
From this narrative, fear of homegrown terrorism resonates the most, as does the impetus to deal with Muslims as a foreign foe. So, too, does the idea that accommodating religious differences is dangerous.
A false dichotomy is created in which Muslims must choose between a Western and European identity or a supposedly separate Islamic identity.
But the relationship between European Muslims’ faith and identification with European nations seldom conforms to the “Eurabia” stereotype.
A wide-ranging global Gallup study that culminated in the book Who Speaks for Islam: What a Billion Muslims Really Think , by John L. Esposito and Dalia Mogahed, includes detailed and sophisticated analysis of European Muslims’ attitudes.
The results suggest that religious and national identities are complementary, not competing, concepts.
Muslims living in Paris, London, and Berlin are more religious than the general public, but they are just as likely as anyone else to identify with their nation and its democratic institutions, and just as likely to reject violence.
The prevailing narrative often regards mosques and Islamic associations as spaces for radicalization, but I contend that some young people are actively turning away from these peaceful institutions.
This may be because mosques and Islamic associations find it difficult to compete with the promises of solace available through the Internet, where voices can address political issues, feed off injustices around the world, and launch calls to arms that can ultimately be murderous.
The Internet is where some young Muslims succumb to the alluring narrative of Islam constructed by those behind the terror attacks of our age.
We also know that the Internet’s devastating impact on handfuls of young people is not confined to the Muslim community, as evidenced by the tragic events in Bridgend in the United Kingdom, where 17 young people, seemingly connected through the Internet, committed suicide.
For some young Muslims, the paramount sub-culture is virtual, and it operates on the fringes of Muslim communities, whether in Europe or in the Islamic world.
The story it presents is of a world beset by real injustices, for which the only solution is violent action that will supposedly lead to the victory of a monolithic Muslim world.
Never mind the inconvenient truth that the acts may be theologically impermissible; the ends justify the means, and there really is no alternative.
Such a narrative is appealing because it feeds into the alienation that many young Muslims feel.
Some may look to unpopular and unjust foreign adventures in Iraq as examples of the futility of lawful political action.
Others feel suffocated by the prevailing toxic discourse that casts European Muslims as foreign, alien, and suspect.
Laws enacted to single out and “persecute” Muslims, and statements that affirm the Islamophobia of our media, buttress the absurd notion that what we are really witnessing is a “war on Islam.”
In Muslim communities everywhere, there is a need to challenge this narrative by making known Islam’s theological repudiation of violence.
We must redouble our efforts to reach out in local communities and demonstrate the realities of our faith.
Thus, one should pay tribute to the resilience of Dutch Muslims as they resist the provocations of the right-wing politician Geert Wilders, who is bent on releasing a film that can only inflame public prejudice against Islam.
Muslims in The Netherlands are responding by opening up their mosques and reaching out to neighbors.
There is a collective responsibility to treat such problems not as Muslim issues, but as problems whose solutions will enhance the values on which European society is based.
Addressing the sense of injustice, siege, and alienation faced by young Muslims is not a victory for the extremists.
Rather, it is a victory for European liberal values because it demonstrates that every individual and every minority is of equal worth.
Indeed, we should view neither homegrown terrorism nor the presence of Muslims as new to Europe.
Islam’s interaction with European society sparked a flowering of knowledge, and large numbers of Muslims have inhabited the Balkans and eastern and central Europe for hundreds of years.
They helped rebuild the economies of war-torn Europe in the 1950’s, arriving as immigrants and then making Europe their home.
In almost every field of life, Muslims have been an integral part of the European tapestry.
All Europeans, including those who are Muslim, are right to worry about the issue of homegrown terrorism.
Our right to security and life is paramount, as is the need to inhabit a space free of prejudice and suspicion.
The 7/7 bombings in 2005 in my home city of London brought this into sharp relief.
The victims were of all faiths and races, including Muslims, as were the heroes who helped London get back on its feet so quickly.
Londoners’ collective message after 7/7 was decisive, and it must be Europe’s message as well: we will not allow such atrocities to divide us.

Re-Thinking Trade Sanctions
The US Congress has voted almost unanimously (418 to 2 in the House of Representatives and 94 to 1 in the Senate) to tighten trade and financial sanctions against Myanmar, whose despotic regime harasses and repeatedly imprisons the country's rightful leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.
She won the presidential election in 1990 but the military prevented her from taking power.
But sanctions are the wrong approach, for international marginalization hurts ordinary citizens far more than it hurts dictatorial regimes.
It's time to curtail the use of economic sanctions and to make them better targeted at despots.
The most famous sanctions in recent history were those imposed on South Africa during the apartheid era.
Much of the world community stopped trading with South Africa, and stopped making investments in South African-based enterprises.
Those sanctions did, it seems, help speed the demise of that barbaric system.
But one great success does not negate the many failures.
Moreover, it is quite possible that the world community could have supported the overthrow of apartheid in other ways.
Of course, sanctions can be effective in hurting the economy of the target country.
Economic development in today's global economy depends on each country being integrated into the worldwide network of production, trade, and investment.
A national economy that is excluded by sanctions is likely to stagnate or even collapse.
Thus, the South African economy experienced an absolute decline in per capita output during the years of widespread sanctions.
But sanctions were not the only reason for decline.
Political unrest also devastated the economy, as did a fall in world gold prices that coincided with the anti-apartheid movement in the final years.
Still, South Africa was hurt badly by sanctions, and the same has been true for many other countries.
Cuba bears a heavy economic burden today not only as a result of its own internal economic mistakes but also because of the barriers to trade and investment imposed by the US since the 1960's.
Haiti went into an economic tailspin when America imposed sanctions in the 1990's, ostensibly to re-establish democracy.
Even today, the US blocks aid for Haiti because some right-wing US Congressmen are intent on toppling President Aristide, whom they abhor.
Iraq and North Korea have likewise been battered by sanctions.
In Iraq during the 1990's, millions of children suffered repeated illnesses and vast numbers died because international sanctions contributed to ruining the country's economy.
North Korea's economy utterly collapsed in the 1990's, leading to widespread famine.
Once again, this results from a combination of North Korea's political despotism, atrocious economic policy, and international sanctions.
Myanmar has already paid an extremely high price for its isolation.
International organizations have cut back or eliminated their work in the country, and much bilateral foreign aid has been eliminated, too.
One result is that HIV/AIDS has run rampant, and the country has received almost no help in getting the epidemic under control.
Myanmar's HIV/AIDS crisis is now by far Southeast Asia's worst.
Although sanctions clearly create suffering in many places, how often have they achieved the desired goal?
In Myanmar, Iraq, North Korea, and Cuba, despotic regimes not only survived the imposition of sanctions, but became more despotic.
These regimes were able to blame foreigners for domestic hardships, even when it was their own policy mistakes and human rights abuses that caused the crises.
Indeed, sanctions weaken an economy and public health, but do not necessarily make it more likely that a despotic regime will collapse.
Sanctions purportedly undermine the regime by causing widespread unrest and by reducing the government's power base and tax collections.
But sanctions also weaken the ability of the private sector to finance an opposition, tend to cut off the domestic opposition from international sources of support, and reduce, rather than increase, international awareness of the abuses taking place.
Some additional effects are even more pernicious.
When legal means of business are outlawed, illegal means become more attractive.
Many countries under sanction, such as Myanmar, become sources of global illegal trafficking in drugs, arms, money laundering, and forced labor.
Drug trafficking or other illegal activities can overtake the whole government, turning it from despotism to international organized crime.
Does this mean that the world should do nothing about despotic regimes?
There is no easy answer, but to the extent that it is possible to weaken a government without weakening an economy, such steps should be taken.
For example, so-called ``smart sanctions'' focus more narrowly on the political leadership.
Smart sanctions include denial of international travel privileges to despots and their families, and subjecting those despots to the risk of international prosecution.
Leaders can thus be made prisoners in their own countries.
Smart sanctions can also specifically target the trade in military goods, cutting off despotic regimes' armed forces.
Moreover, foreign aid can be shifted away from government towards non-governmental organizations, strengthening the civil societies in such countries.
It is easy to vote against Mynamar's government, but it is harder to foster political change.
Starving Myanmar's economy is unlikely to help, but it is certain to deepen the suffering of its people.
Of course, countries that embrace the use of sanctions do not intend this, but that does not lessen their responsibility for the outcome.

A Statue for Stalin?
PRINCETON – Hitler and Stalin were ruthless dictators who committed murder on a vast scale. But, while it is impossible to imagine a Hitler statue in Berlin, or anywhere else in Germany, statues of Stalin have been restored in towns across Georgia (his birthplace), and another is to be erected in Moscow as part of a commemoration of all Soviet leaders.
The difference in attitude extends beyond the borders of the countries over which these men ruled.
In the United States, there is a bust of Stalin at the National D-Day Memorial in Virginia.
In New York, I recently dined at a Russian restaurant that featured Soviet paraphernalia, waitresses in Soviet uniforms, and a painting of Soviet leaders in which Stalin was prominent.
New York also has its KGB Bar.
To the best of my knowledge, there is no Nazi-themed restaurant in New York; nor is there a Gestapo or SS bar.
So, why is Stalin seen as relatively more acceptable than Hitler?
At a press conference last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted a justification.
Asked about Moscow’s plans for a statue of Stalin, he pointed to Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the Parliamentarian side in the seventeenth-century English Civil War, and asked: “What’s the real difference between Cromwell and Stalin?”
He then answered his own question: “None whatsoever,” and went on to describe Cromwell as a “cunning fellow” who “played a very ambiguous role in Britain’s history.”
(A statue of Cromwell stands outside the House of Commons in London.)
“Ambiguous” is a reasonable description of the morality of Cromwell’s actions.
While he promoted parliamentary rule in England, ended the civil war, and allowed a degree of religious toleration, he also supported the trial and execution of Charles I and brutally conquered Ireland in response to a perceived threat from an alliance of Irish Catholics and English Royalists.
But, unlike Cromwell, Stalin was responsible for the deaths of very large numbers of civilians, outside any war or military campaign.
According to Timothy Snyder, author of Bloodlands, 2-3 million people died in the forced labor camps of the Gulag and perhaps a million were shot during the Great Terror of the late 1930’s.
Another five million starved in the famine of 1930-1933, of whom 3.3 million were Ukrainians who died as a result of a deliberate policy related to their nationality or status as relatively prosperous peasants known as kulaks.
Snyder’s estimate of the total number of Stalin’s victims does not take into account those who managed to survive forced labor or internal exile in harsh conditions.
Including them might add as many as 25 million to the number of those who suffered terribly as a result of Stalin’s tyranny.
The total number of deaths that Snyder attributes to Stalin is lower than the commonly cited figure of 20 million, which was estimated before historians had access to the Soviet archives.
It is nonetheless a horrendous total – similar in magnitude to the Nazis’ killings (which took place during a shorter period).
Moreover, the Soviet archives show that one cannot say that the Nazi’s killings were worse because victims were targeted on the basis of their race or ethnicity.
Stalin, too, selected some of his victims on this basis – not only Ukrainians, but also people belonging to ethnic minorities associated with countries bordering the Soviet Union.
Stalin’s persecutions also targeted a disproportionately large number of Jews.
There were no gas chambers, and arguably the motivation for Stalin’s killings was not genocide, but rather the intimidation and suppression of real or imaginary opposition to his rule. That in no way excuses the extent of the killing and imprisonment that occurred.
If there is any “ambiguity” about Stalin’s moral record, it may be because communism strikes a chord with some of our nobler impulses, seeking equality for all and an end to poverty.
No such universal aspiration can be found in Nazism, which, even on its face, was not concerned about what was good for all, but about what was good for one supposed racial group, and which was clearly motivated by hatred and contempt for other ethnic groups.
But communism under Stalin was the opposite of egalitarian, for it gave absolute power to a few, and denied all rights to the many.
Those who defend Stalin’s reputation credit him with lifting millions out of poverty; but millions could have been lifted out of poverty without murdering and incarcerating millions more.
Others defend Stalin’s greatness on the basis of his role in repelling the Nazi invasion and ultimately defeating Hitler.
Yet Stalin’s purge of military leaders during the Great Terror critically weakened the Red Army, his signing of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in 1939 paved the way for the start of World War II, and his blindness to the Nazi threat in 1941 left the Soviet Union unprepared to resist Hitler’s attack.
It remains true that Stalin led his country to victory in war, and to a position of global power that it had not held before and from which it has since fallen.
Hitler, by contrast, left his country shattered, occupied, and divided.
People identify with their country and look up to those who led it when it was at its most powerful.
That may explain why Muscovites are more willing to accept a statue of Stalin than Berliners would be to have one of Hitler.
But that can be only part of the reason for the different treatment given to these mass murderers.
It still leaves me puzzled about New York’s Soviet-themed restaurant and KGB Bar.

Ukraine’s Path Not Taken
BRUSSELS – Sometimes history can be too ironic.
This week, as Ukraine marked the 80th anniversary of the Holodomor, Stalin’s engineered famine in Ukraine, President Viktor Yanukovych’s government announced that it would not sign a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union at a summit in Vilnius on November 28.
Just like that, Ukraine’s chance to transcend its tortured history appears to have been thrown away.
The ostensible issue that forced Yanukovych to balk was the EU’s demand that former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, now serving a seven-year prison sentence, be permitted to travel to Germany for medical treatment.
Though the European Court of Human Rights has ruled her imprisonment politically motivated, Yanukovych – whose power to pardon is absolute – has refused to countenance her release, desiring above all to prevent her candidacy in the Ukrainian presidential election due in 2015.
Perhaps Yanukovych’s retreat from Europe should have been foreseen, given behavior – like locking up his political opponents – that has been difficult to reconcile with European values and democratic norms.
But it was his recent series of secret meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin that sealed the fate of the agreement with the EU.
Former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski once observed that in Russian eyes, Russia without Ukraine was a normal nation-state, but Russia with Ukraine was an empire.
But Russians who believe that Yanukovych’s retreat from Europe represents a great victory should think again.
Just as Putin’s gross mismanagement of the economy has led even the economics minister to predict stagnation for the rest of this decade, his geopolitical nostalgia is poised to saddle Russians with the same dysfunctional empire that impoverished them under the Soviets.
Worse still, it seems that only the same system – in which siloviki (secret policemen) are in charge – appears capable of holding together such a ramshackle economic empire.
Putin can preen, but the fact remains that Ukraine’s economy is in far worse shape than Russia’s.
A demographically declining empire of crony capitalists, from which the most talented and educated flee – some 300,000 left Russia last year alone – is hardly likely to be a serious strategic challenger to either the United States or China.
On the contrary, China covets much of eastern Russia, lands taken from it during its years of “humiliation” in the nineteenth century.
Having recently traveled to Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine, I saw firsthand the splits in the political class and in public opinion concerning whether these countries should hitch their economies and security to Europe and the US, or submit to Russia through membership in its Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC).
The Russian system vaguely resembles Imperial Japan’s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in both its rhetoric and its aim of subordinating neighbors.
Armenia was the first ex-Soviet state to succumb to Putin’s pressure and shun the EU Eastern Partnership.
After four years of negotiations, Putin warned President Serzh Sargsyan that the price of Russian gas would be doubled, Russian security guarantees would be withdrawn (Armenia is locked in a bitter dispute with oil-rich Azerbaijan), and the large Armenian diaspora in Russia would no longer be as welcome to work and live in the country as before.
Similar attempts to bully Georgia were made, and former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili talked about joining Putin’s customs union.
But, following the overwhelming defeat of the overtly pro-Russia candidate Nino Burjanadze in the recent presidential election, the ruling Georgian Dream party decided to stay the Euro-Atlantic course, particularly as Georgia’s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions remain under Russian occupation.
(Russia has also tried heavy-handed tactics on Moldova by threatening to ban the country’s wine exports to Russia and to recognize the independence of the breakaway territory of Transnistria.)
The West can diminish the force of Russian bullying by assuring ex-Soviet countries that the Eastern Partnership is not dead, and that something short of the envisioned free-trade areas will emerge.
The EU can also continue to work for greater access to visas and, eventually, full visa-free travel.
It can remain engaged on cooperation agreements affecting aviation, trade, academic exchanges, transport, infrastructure, tourism, and agriculture and rural development.
Moreover, it can provide renewed help for democratic institution-building: assisting judicial reform, raising anti-corruption awareness, and encouraging prosecution of even high-ranking offenders, as well as supporting engagement by civil-society groups.
Perhaps most critically, countries such as Austria, where members of the Yanukovych clique have created obscure companies to hide their ill-gotten assets, can stop turning a blind eye to the plundering of countries like Ukraine.
Unfortunately, in an era of budgetary austerity and lingering eurozone fragility, EU member states were unable to neutralize Russia’s economic threats against Ukraine, particularly the loss of the Russian market.
Perhaps a more radical solution to Russian bullying might have been to match Russia’s recent arbitrary ban on Ukrainian chocolate exports with a ban on Russian vodka exports to the EU.
In the end, it may be the oligarchs who have bankrolled Yanukovych’s career – particularly Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine’s richest man – who will make the ultimate decision about Ukraine’s fate.
As Ukraine’s European prospects diminish, the economy – and thus the oligarchs’ fortunes – will be exposed to the Russian siloviki’s untender mercies.
Perhaps once Akhmetov and his ilk comprehend the long-term risks to their businesses and wealth, they will induce MPs that are beholden to them to switch sides and unite with pro-EU forces to restore Ukraine’s European future.
