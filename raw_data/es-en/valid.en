Squaring Asia’s Nuclear Triangle
TOKYO – Just before the fourth trilateral summit between Japan, China, and South Korea began on May 21, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan jointly visited the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, offering encouragement to the disaster’s victims living in evacuation centers.
Since the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in March, Kan has aimed at lifting the bans that many countries have imposed on imports of Japanese agricultural products, and so offered the two heads of state cherries from Fukushima in a bid to highlight their safety.
At the summit, the three countries issued a joint statement outlining cooperation on a wide range of issues, including nuclear safety, disaster prevention, economic growth, and the environment.
The lessons learned from Japan’s earthquake and nuclear accident would be shared with China, South Korea, and the wider international community, and, in an addendum, the Japanese authorities promised to “continue to provide information…with the greatest transparency possible.”
In fact, the Kan administration – which loathes the involvement of bureaucrats, who are professionals, in managing public affairs – delayed notifying neighboring countries when it was forced to order the release of water containing low concentrations of radioactive material.
For Kan, the real priority was his government’s effort to maintain its grip on power, not reassuring Japan’s neighbors of the actions it was taking to contain a potential threat to their citizens.
The codicil to the summit communiqué was created to address these concerns.
It emphasized the importance of sharing information about nuclear safety, and incorporated specific measures, including the creation of a framework for rapid notification in the event of an emergency and exchanges of experts to assist in managing future nuclear crises and ensuring that regional concerns are taken into account.
Ever since the Fukushima accident, opposition to nuclear power has been growing in China and South Korea, both of which had been planning a massive expansion of their nuclear generating capacity – and both of which face a change of political leadership next year.
China’s succession, though set, will nonetheless bring a period of uncertainty, while South Korea will undoubtedly face its usual no-holds-barred democratic battle in its coming presidential election.
Given these political realities, keeping ordinary citizens content about civilian nuclear power has become a greater priority than usual in both countries.
This confluence of political need has created an opportunity for all three countries to cooperate more closely in the management of civilian nuclear power, and this opportunity should not be missed.
Sensing this, China and South Korea have provided humanitarian and economic aid to areas affected by the earthquake, and both countries were quick to send specialized teams to Japan to search for the missing.
The first country to send a rescue team to Japan, however, was Taiwan (which also was the largest single provider of donations, amounting to ¥20 billion).
But, owing to what Kan’s government called “confusion on the ground,” Taiwan’s rescue team was kept waiting for days.
And, while the people of Japan were grateful for Taiwan’s unexpected generosity, the Japanese government failed to offer any thanks, despite running advertisements in major newspapers expressing gratitude for the relief sent from other countries.
(Eventually, a public campaign raised the money to run an advertisement in a Taiwanese newspaper.)
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou was as surprised as the Japanese by the size of the contributions made by his people.
Ma had been tilting his government’s policies increasingly toward China, concluding a bilateral framework agreement on economic cooperation.
But, in the wake of Taiwanese society’s outpouring of sympathy for Japan, he has adjusted his stance.
The Ma government has also been kept on its toes by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party’s call for the phase-out of nuclear power in Taiwan by 2025.
Taiwan has three nuclear power plants, and, like the plant at Fukushima, they directly face the ocean.
Two are located within 20 kilometers of the capital, Taipei, and it is generally agreed that there would be no escape for the vast majority of the capital’s citizens should a major nuclear accident occur.
Construction of a fourth nuclear power plant, which began in 1999, was suspended by DPP President Chen Shui-bian the following year.
Although Chen’s government, under pressure from the opposition Kuomintang, later restarted work on the plant, design revisions have repeatedly delayed its completion.
Opposition from local residents remains stiff.
At their recent trilateral summit, Japan, China, and South Korea skillfully evaded direct mention of the delicately poised security issues that they face.
And, while they did bring nuclear safety to the fore and agreed to cooperate and share information with each other, efforts to meet this region-wide challenge cannot succeed without bringing Taiwan into the discussions.
Taiwan should also be allowed to participate in the International Atomic Energy Agency in the area of nuclear safety, just as it became an observer at the World Health Organization during the SARS and avian flu pandemics of the 1990’s.
Where nuclear safety is concerned, China must rethink its policy of isolating Taiwan from international bodies.

The Transatlantic Continental Drift
DENVER – The Earth’s continental plates broke apart and first began to shift hundreds of millions of years ago.
But anyone visiting European capitals or following events in President Donald Trump’s Washington can be forgiven for thinking that another tectonic divergence is underway.
Of course, transatlantic mistrust is not new.
In the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, then-US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sparked controversy by drawing a line between “old Europe” and “new Europe,” the latter comprising the ex-communist states that were more enthusiastic about following the US into war.
In the eyes of many Europeans, Rumsfeld’s goal was to sow division within Europe.
Now Europe must deal with another difficult American named Donald.
The Trump administration has pursued an even more aggressive approach to Europe, deeming the European Union a strategic competitor and raising doubts about America’s long-term commitment to European security.
In keeping with the Trumpian worldview, the US now views Europe as a freeloader that has taken advantage of American largesse.
Demonstrating his tenuous grasp of US interests, Trump seems intent on weakening the forces of European integration.
He also has tried to drive wedges between Europeans, and not just between “old” and “new” (among whom he has a number of cheerleaders).
For example, Trump makes no secret of his sympathy for the Brexiteers, even as they continue to discredit themselves in the eyes of most Europeans, and perhaps even among a majority in the United Kingdom, too.
Trump’s “America First” worldview makes no room for a partnership between the US and Europe, or for any allies who do not automatically throw their support behind US policies.
US Vice President Mike Pence made this all too clear at the Munich Security Conference in February, where he scolded Europeans for undermining US sanctions against Iran, and rather resembled a teacher reciting a list of overdue assignments.
American paternalism toward Europe will not necessarily end with Trump.
As we have seen, it reflects a longstanding attitude within the US national-security establishment, including among neoconservatives, many of whom have openly refused ever to work for Trump.
On issues ranging from the Balkans to the Russian threat against Ukraine, the prevailing American view is that Europeans are weak.
Or, as a popular 2003 foreign-policy book put it, “Americans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus.”
To be sure, Europe also bears some of the blame for transatlantic tensions.
When the EU began its expansion process some 20 years ago, Poland and other EU applicants complained to US diplomats about being told by European envoys to choose between America and the EU, as if there were two different sets of values and interests.
Europeans’ supposedly more evolved views on climate change, the death penalty, the uses of soft power, and many other issues were marshaled in support of a single European identity, with interests distinct from those of the US.
Of course, much has changed since then, and some Europeans have come to realize that they must do more to strengthen transatlanticism, not least by increasing their defense spending, streamlining EU decision-making processes, and settling economic disputes. (One major holdout is Germany, whose defense spending as a share of GDP remains well below the 2% target set by NATO.)
But an even more fundamental challenge for Europe is internal.
Across a wide array of issues, Europe’s leaders need to do a better job of explaining to their constituents what the European project is really about.
To earlier generations, the answer was obvious: European integration is necessary to prevent another world war.
But while that was true 70 years ago, it is clear that the project’s raison d’être needs to be updated to address European voters’ current concerns.
Europeans originally thought they were joining together in a civilizational undertaking.
But with the deepening of the bloc’s structural integration and the inclusion of a unified Germany, many Europeans started to feel like they had been forced into the world’s most onerous bureaucracy.
And as social and economic pressures from immigration have increased, more Europeans have begun to feel as though they have lost their national identities.
Their minds are not likely to be changed by lectures about moral responsibility and the needs of the less fortunate.
Hence, for some member states – including some that have benefited tremendously from EU membership – the instinct now is to shut the door and roll out the barbed wire.
But as any serious European leader knows, migrant and refugee crises – and immigration policy more generally – must be addressed comprehensively at the EU level, including with a robust foreign policy focused on addressing the root causes of the problem.
As Europeans grapple with fundamental issues of identity, bureaucracy, and sovereignty, US policymakers, whatever their political pedigree, need to take a deep breath and reflect on the causes of the current transatlantic rift.
Specifically, they should consider whether high-handed paternalism is really the best approach to a continent whose values and interests so overwhelmingly overlap with their own.
At the risk of stating the obvious, the rising threat to democracy – and even to civilization itself – demands that the US and Europe demonstrate more mutual respect and cooperation.
There is no reason to expect anything to change under the current US administration, but we still need all hands on deck to prepare for a better future for transatlantic relations.
It’s time to push the continental plates back together.

How Not to Launch a Digital Currency
NEW YORK – In June 2019, Facebook made a daring announcement: within a year, it would launch a new global currency, the Libra.
The idea was to offer an alternative to national currencies in cross-border transactions, and to provide a payment network for billions of unbanked people.
A strictly digital token, the Libra was to be issued by an association in Switzerland and backed by a basket of national currencies, implying that its creators sought independence from sovereign powers.
But Facebook soon lowered its sights.
Libra has since been renamed Diem, and the issuing entity has moved from Switzerland to the United States, where it has formed a partnership with Silvergate Bank to issue a token that complies with US banking regulations.
A project that began by taking its name from a Roman currency and wrapping itself in the image of Caesar Augustus has ended as part of an online financial-services platform based in a corporate office park in La Jolla.
Libra’s quick rise and fall is a telltale case of a premature and ill-designed attempt to challenge the powers that be.
Among other things, its fate highlights the critical importance of building coalitions that are willing and able to play both offense and defense against challengers.
Facebook and the Libra Association did not invent the idea of digital currencies, which had been around for a decade.
Nor were they breaking new ground in payment systems.
Companies like PayPal have been building alternative systems in the shadow of (and often by piggybacking on) existing banking infrastructure for more than two decades.
This low profile was both a strength and a weakness: it allowed new platforms to expand without raising the ire of regulators; but it also left them dependent on legacy institutions and easy to copy.
As a latecomer to the game, Facebook hoped to use its comparative advantage as a digital platform with more than 2.3 billion users to take digital currency mainstream.
Building on the “stable coin” fad, Libra was to be tethered to a basket of currencies issued by countries with a reputation for stability, and with reliable backstopping from central banks.
Its value would track a weighted average of the British pound, the US dollar, the euro, the Singapore dollar, and the Japanese yen, even though it would be issued by an entity outside any of those countries’ jurisdictions.
The regulatory backlash was swift and fierce.
Within weeks, hearings were organized in both houses of the US Congress, and politicians around the world voiced their disapproval.
National authorities quickly formed a united front and pledged to scrutinize every aspect of what they perceived as a threat to their monetary sovereignty.
The Financial Stability Board, which counts the G20 among its members, launched a review of the existing regulatory frameworks and began coordinating the response to Libra and other aspiring global stable coins.
Nothing unites disparate interests like a common enemy.
Libra’s ambition was more than the world’s leading economic powers could take.
No matter how much Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pleaded for leniency or fearmongered about China’s efforts to develop a global digital payment system, he could not sway the powers that be.
Facebook was forced to retreat.
First, the Libra Association started losing key members.
When Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal left, the writing was on the wall, even though the overall number of members continued to increase.
To alleviate market and political concerns, Facebook had to renounce its own engagement with the association.
Then came the ill-fated renaming from Libra (balance) to Diem (day), which has been tainted by copyright issues.
When the Diem Association finally announced its relocation from Switzerland to the US this month, it was hard not to be reminded of Henry IV’s infamous trek to Canossa in 1077.
Though Henry was emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, he was forced to humiliate himself by crossing the Alps in winter to beg for leniency from Pope Gregory VII, whose authority he had openly challenged by appointing bishops in contravention of a papal decree.
Henry’s challenge to papal authority succeeded as long as he had the German kings behind him.
But the pope responded by excommunicating Henry, denouncing the other kings’ pledge of allegiance, and lobbying them to deny Henry their support unless he agreed to atone.
When Henry’s allies wavered, he had no choice but to submit himself on both knees to the pope.
Facebook’s retreat has been less dramatic: a reshuffling of paperwork and negotiations with a different set of regulators are all it took to decamp to Southern California.
Nonetheless, the history of the struggle between secular and religious power, epitomized by Henry and Gregory’s standoff, holds lessons for power seekers today.
Above all, it is risky business to reach for the crown jewel of state sovereignty – in this case, money.
If you dare to do so, you should be sure that you and your collaborators are sufficiently independent from the power that is being challenged.
And you had better have the capacity to backstop your own money, lest it crash when its holders seek safety and rush for the exit.
Monetary incumbents also can learn from Libra’s fate.
In earthly matters, power is always contested and therefore always temporary.
With challengers perpetually waiting in the wings, incumbents that do not learn how to control them will eventually have to yield.

No Clash of Civilizations

The Crises Nexus
NEW YORK – Policymakers, academics, and journalists usually discuss the global financial crisis and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as if they somehow exist on parallel tracks.
But today’s financial and foreign-affairs crises are in fact closely linked.
Indeed, the way the world has sought to resolve the financial crisis offers interesting insights about how the foreign-affairs crisis should be approached.
Today’s foreign-affairs crisis goes well beyond Afghanistan and Iraq.
The record of countries that move from conflict to a fragile peace through military intervention or negotiated settlements is dismal: roughly half of them revert to conflict, leading to more human tragedy and large numbers of refugees.
Moreover, failed states are an incubator for terrorism, trafficking of drugs and people, piracy, and other illicit activities.
Of the half that remains at peace, the large majority end up highly dependent on foreign aid – hardly a sustainable model in the context of the global financial crisis.
The two crises have created immense human suffering worldwide: thousands of families have lost loved ones in wars, and the financial crisis has taken people’s jobs, livelihoods, assets, pensions, and dreams, as well as worsening fiscal and debt conditions in most industrial countries.
As a result, taxpayers in donor countries are demanding more transparency and accountability in how their money is spent both domestically and abroad – and rightly so.
There are notable links between the two crises.
The war in Iraq contributed in part to the increase in oil prices from $35 per barrel in 2003 to $140 in 2007.
This increase put pressure on businesses and consumers, and was a major factor in the increase in world food prices.
As prices went up and recessionary pressures increased, many homeowners failed to pay their mortgages.
The sub-prime sector in the United States was hit, and the financial crisis spread from there.
Both crises require policymaking that departs from “business as usual.”
Short-term emergency policies are needed to deal with high unemployment, home foreclosures, business bankruptcies, and often with hunger, disease, and a number of other ills.
Emergency or humanitarian policies may improve basic consumption in the short run, but they may also discourage investment, increase inflation, and lower prospects for economic in the long run.
As a result, such policies should be discontinued as soon as possible.
Recovering from both crises will require effective economic reconstruction to create jobs.
In addition to restructuring the financial sector, recovery programs in the US, the United Kingdom, and other industrial countries hardest hit by the financial crisis must include relief for home and business owners, and job creation through infrastructure projects, clean-energy technologies, and improvements in healthcare and education.
In Afghanistan and Iraq, reconstruction must include not only the rehabilitation of services and infrastructure, but – more challenging – the creation of a macroeconomic, legal, and regulatory framework for effective policymaking.
To avoid a continuation of conflict and aid-dependency, the main focus of the international aid commitment should be to reactivate small enterprises and promote startup companies in various sectors in order to create viable economies that enable people to earn a legal and decent living.
Despite their commonality, there has been a stark contrast in approaches to resolving these two crises.
While programs in industrial and emerging economies aimed at addressing the financial crisis have been broadly debated at the national and international level, the debate about Afghanistan and Iraq has been narrowly focused on military and security issues, undermining the need for a major effort at effective reconstruction.
Interestingly, whereas most Americans are well aware of the $700 billion price tag for restructuring banks and the $787 billion stimulus package, far less attention has been paid to the almost $1 trillion spent on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
Many assume that the cost is so high because reconstruction is expensive.
But only 6% of this amount was allocated for reconstruction and other aid programs.
The rest was allocated to the US Department of Defense as a supplement to its annual budget, which has been between $500 and $650 billion in recent years.
World leaders should recognize that a larger investment in reconstruction, together with a comprehensive and well-balanced strategy to ensure accountability and appropriate policies for lawful employment, could have prevented these vast military expenditures, both in Iraq since 2006 and in Afghanistan since the Taliban government was ousted in 2001.
Just as world leaders have led the global discussion on policies to resolve the financial crisis, they should start a broad-based debate on the international community’s future involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other war-torn countries, where better living conditions are needed to give the local population a stake in the peace process.
The international community should recognize that military, security, and peacekeeping operations are costly and will not succeed in the absence of new, innovative, and integrated strategies for economic reconstruction.

The West’s Final Countdown?
BERLIN – The year is still young, but its historical significance is already clear.
At least as far as the West is concerned, foreseeable events in the coming months will have an overwhelming and decisive impact on the future.
The moment of truth will come on November 3, 2020, when voters in the United States elect the country’s next president.
To be sure, US presidential elections have always been globally important, because they determine who will lead the world’s most powerful country for the next four years.
But the stakes are much higher this time.
The re-election of President Donald Trump could spell the end of the liberal world order and the system of alliances that America has fostered since the 1940s.
Departing from America’s tradition of global leadership, Trump favors a narrow-minded nationalism, and has shown little restraint in undermining US democracy itself, not least by challenging the separation of powers and other core institutions.
Should Trump win in November, he will have a mandate to wreak havoc for another four years.
The result will fit the description he offered in his first inaugural address: American carnage.
Make no mistake: it makes a big difference whether Trump is in office for eight years rather than just four.
In addition to Americans, Europeans would be the first to feel the consequences of a second Trump term.
The fact is that Europe remains almost existentially dependent on the US, both economically and for its security.
This dependence is a legacy of the twentieth century, with its two world wars and its long Cold War. Such deeply rooted historical realities cannot be easily or quickly reversed.
Already, Trump has forced Europe to pursue its own sovereignty; but achieving that end will not come easily or cheaply.
When Trump was elected in 2016, almost everyone both inside and outside the US was caught by surprise.
In 2020, no one will make the same mistake again.
But nor can anyone claim not to know what they are getting with Trump.
He may be a stranger to the truth, but he has stayed mostly true to his campaign promises.
That said, it would be wrong to expect merely four more years of the same.
If Trump is re-elected, he will most likely behave even more radically and without restraint.
He will be fully convinced that he is the “chosen one,” having successfully withstood perfidious attacks by the opposition, the old establishment, the media, and the “deep state.”
Who would be left to stop him, or at least to chasten him?
For all of its disastrous implications, the idea of a “second Trump term” has not shaken the European Union from its frustrating habit of pursuing business as usual.
EU officials are currently negotiating the terms of the bloc’s next seven-year €1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) budget.
Part of this involves a new battle over the allocation of regional and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funds following Brexit. The Trump presidency has been a negligible factor in the proceedings.
And although a strategy for achieving European sovereignty necessarily would require new financial commitments, that particular issue has scarcely come up.
Instead, within the European Council, short-term national interests have prevailed.
It is as if the world has not fundamentally changed over the past three years.
One might think European leaders’ priorities would adjust to the Trump presidency, the emergence of China as a global power, Russia’s bet on military strength and rearmament, and the rise of the digital economy.
But no: self-interested haggling dominates the agenda in Brussels and in Europe’s national capitals (which have always played a fundamental role in EU governance).
Strategic thinking and a sense of historical responsibility are, at best, an afterthought.
Worse, this state of affairs prevails despite the fact that there is no more important issue to Europe than the US presidential election.
Europeans should be preparing for the worst.
The key question, both for Europe and the West more broadly, is whether NATO could survive a second Trump term.
If NATO were to unravel, Europe and the North Atlantic region would suddenly face an enormous security crisis.
In fact, without the transatlantic bond that the Alliance provides, one could hardly speak of “the West” at all.
And Europe certainly wouldn’t be able to manage its own security.
In Brussels, but particularly at the European Council, the top-line agenda should reflect the fact that the strategic groundwork for the twenty-first century is being laid now – at this very moment.
There is far more at stake than the outcome of the next national election in any one European country.
This is not to discount the importance of regional and CAP funds.
But with all due respect to the frugal net contributors and the poorer recipient countries that depend on EU disbursements, there simply are bigger issues that need to be addressed.
Europe’s very security and sovereignty are now at risk.
The EU must ask itself if it is prepared to do what is necessary to remain an independent player, united in the common interest of all Europeans.
Otherwise, Europe’s viability as a democratic, sovereign entity in control of its own destiny will be called into question – and therefore tested by adversaries – like never before.

Saudi Arabia’s Perilous Pivot
JERUSALEM – “The most dangerous moment for a bad government,” the nineteenth-century French statesman and historian Alexis de Tocqueville observed, “is usually when it begins to reform itself.”
Reform, after all, implies that traditional norms and institutions may have already been discredited, but that alternative structures have yet to be firmly established.
Tocqueville’s classic example was the regime of Louis XVI, whose attempts at reform quickly led to the French Revolution, and to his own execution in 1793.
Another example is Mikhail Gorbachev’s effort to reform the Soviet Union in the 1980s.
By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union had collapsed and Gorbachev was out of power.
Today, something similar could very well happen to the young Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (widely known as MBS), as he takes steps to modernize his country.
Saudi Arabia has long maintained (relative) internal stability by spreading its enormous oil wealth among its subjects, and by imposing on Saudi society fundamentalist Islamic doctrines based on the austere Wahhabi tradition.
After the Kingdom’s founding in 1932, many Saudis enjoyed unprecedentedly high standards of living, and hundreds of members of the Saudi royal family were transformed from desert sheikhs into enormously rich members of the international moneyed elite.
Various sons of the regime’s founder, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, succeeded each other as rulers a kingdom that, following Arab tradition, bore the name of its founding and ruling dynasty (another is the current Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan).
In recent years, however, the Saudi regime has had to worry about its future.
Plummeting oil prices followed the 2011-2012 Arab Spring, which brought down rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen, and seriously challenged the al-Assad family’s rule in Syria.
MBS, for his part, has gotten the message: Since being named crown prince in June 2017, he has introduced sweeping reforms to the Saudi system.
Some of MBS’s actions have garnered favorable international press coverage, not least his decrees allowing women to drive and curtailing the power of the religious police, who have long enforced public dress codes.
These are positive steps toward emancipating the Kingdom from the more oppressive elements of Wahhabism.
So, too, are the crown prince’s statements calling for more tolerance of Christian, Jewish, and other non-Muslim communities, as well as his strengthening of ties with Israel.
Still, other new policies could prove problematic.
MBS’s plan for diversifying the Saudi economy to reduce its dependence on oil is still on the drawing board.
But, in the meantime, he has launched a (euphemistically named) “anti-corruption” campaign that has raised red flags for outside observers.
Since last November, MBS has had hundreds of members of the Saudi elite – including princes and businessmen with international profiles – arrested on dubious grounds, and with no regard for the rule of law.
To be sure, Saudi Arabia lacks a basic code of laws or legally enshrined rights.
And many frustrated Saudis might welcome the fact that those rounded up in the purge have agreed, under duress, to “return” some of their obviously ill-gotten fortunes to the treasury – which, of course, is controlled by the crown prince.
But even if MBS succeeds in shoring up his power and endearing himself to the people in the short term, it has become clear that he intends to rule as an authoritarian despot when he succeeds his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud.
This would be a radical departure from the Kingdom’s tradition of power-sharing among princes within a highly decentralized system.
MBS’s hardnosed political style also has international implications.
For starters, he has taken an increasingly tough line against Iran and that country’s regional ambitions, thus exacerbating the Sunni-Shia divide.
MBS’s approach – which includes ill-informed statements comparing the Iranian regime to Nazi Germany – has the support of other Sunni countries such as Egypt and Jordan, and from US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. But it hardly bodes well for the region’s stability.
Moreover, MBS’s military intervention in Yemen has been a failure, and his decision to impose an embargo on Qatar – a small but wealthy Gulf country that challenges Saudi hegemony – has backfired.
Similarly, his attempt late last year to depose Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri ended in a fiasco.
It is hard to say where Saudi Arabia may be heading.
The country certainly needs comprehensive reforms. But the jury is still out on whether MBS’s approach is the right one.
If he succeeds, he will emerge with a reputation as a reformer.
Yet he clearly is not interested in establishing representative institutions or strengthening the rule of law, so his country will have become a personal dictatorship.
Alternatively, MBS’s authoritarian tendencies and embarrassing foreign-policy failures might provoke internal opposition, both from the traditional elites he has vowed to decimate, and from the sizeable Shia minority in the Kingdom’s Eastern Province, whose members may look to Iran as a protector.
And, on the international front, MBS’s escalation with Iran could spin out of his control.
Despite its recent weapons purchases from the US, Saudi Arabia would still be outmatched in a military confrontation with Iran.
If such a confrontation does take place, one must hope that it will not lead to a wider regional war.

Escaping Bibi's Shadow
JERUSALEM – Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett returned from this month’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) feeling buoyant.
Hobnobbing with world leaders in Scotland lent credibility to his projected image as a worthy replacement to Binyamin Netanyahu, his polarizing and larger-than-life predecessor who reigned supreme over Israel for more than 12 years.
But Bennett’s momentum – and his government – could be short-lived unless he is able to exercise prudent leadership in the months ahead.
In November, Israel’s Knesset (parliament) passed new budget frameworks for 2021 and 2022 – a huge achievement for Bennett, given that the Knesset had not ratified a fiscal plan since March 2018.
This triumph is a double-edged sword, however, because it might easily unleash political forces to precipitate his government’s early demise.
The Israeli cabinet is literally a team of rivals, comprising ministers affiliated with the country’s ideological right, center, and left.
Their commitment to working together was forged in the crucible of their shared antipathy toward Netanyahu.
A similar aversion to Netanyahu’s comportment and policies has been prevalent in certain foreign capitals, where leaders bristle at the prospect of his possible return to power.
This has given Bennett additional ballast and mitigated what would likely have been more vocal international criticism of Israel had Netanyahu remained in charge.
In fact, Netanyahu is the proverbial superglue that has secured his successor tightly in place thus far.
That adhesive might be dissolving.
One significant consequence of the approval of the 2021 budget is the virtual neutralization of the opposition, which requires 61 of the Knesset’s 120 members to coalesce around the candidacy of an alternative premier – presumably Netanyahu – to unseat the current government.
The haywire results of Israel’s four recent, rapid-fire parliamentary elections, during which Netanyahu repeatedly failed to win the backing of 61 legislators, offer convincing proof of that scenario’s implausibility.
He now acknowledges dejectedly that it could take another three and a half years to topple Bennett’s cohort.
Netanyahu’s own spiral toward political irrelevance is further hindering his attempts to send Bennett packing prematurely.
Although Likud remains the largest caucus in parliament, its declared boycott of Knesset committees has all but disintegrated, leaving the core of Netanyahu’s putative government divided and in disarray.
Increasingly preoccupied with court dates relating to corruption charges from his tenure as premier, Netanyahu also finds himself busy trying to assuage his frustrated allies, who had become accustomed to the trappings of power.
The resulting vacuum is providing Bennett and his ministers with the dubious luxury of breathing room to promote their respective partisan agendas as never before.
Open conflict among the coalition’s erstwhile antagonists over the government’s course could ultimately render their fragile alliance untenable.
Suddenly, and paradoxically, the fledgling government is vulnerable to implosion.
Cabinet disputes erupted recently over the government’s moves to criminalize six Palestinian agencies – the groups in question claim to be legitimate civil-society organizations, while Israel says they are connected to terrorist factions – and to greenlight the construction of new settler homes in the West Bank.
Looming challenges emanating from serial flare-ups on Israel’s borders with Gaza and Lebanon, a potential resumption of diplomatic negotiations concerning Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and various items of domestic legislation also threaten to exacerbate intra-coalition tensions.
A parallel risk to the integrity of Bennett’s coalition will come from quarters of the global community that have generally applauded his approach, but may now – with Netanyahu’s specter having receded – exhibit less tolerance for Israeli policies of which they disapprove.
The Biden administration’s reaction to Israel’s latest settlement announcement was markedly more severe in tone, suggesting that a tipping point may have been reached.
Biden reportedly pledged a temporary delay in reopening the US consulate in Jerusalem – a move that Foreign Minister Yair Lapid warned “might destabilize this government” – until after Israel’s budget debate.
This may have been a harbinger of mounting international demands for greater flexibility from Bennett.
Having passed the budget hurdle, Bennett may soon confront the limits of his power, and his premiership could come to an abrupt end if some of his cabinet partners see him as too compliant with foreign demands.
It is still unclear how much wiggle room Israel’s allies will afford Bennett.
They might prefer to abide by his more controversial actions if only to clear the path for Lapid – whom some may view as more amenable to their policy goals in the Middle East – to assume the premiership in August 2023, as envisaged under their coalition agreement.
In the meantime, Bennett will need to tread adroitly if he hopes to continue in office long enough to solidify the transformational changes he has begun to implement in domestic and foreign policy.
Almost bereft of an electoral base of his own, the prime minister will be anxious to court new voters, but will have to navigate cautiously through a minefield of other actors’ clashing politics and principles.
The price of a misstep could be a fifth election contest against a revitalized Netanyahu (if he hangs on) or a new Likud leader – a contest Bennett may not survive.

Are We Really Secessionists Now?
LONDON – The World Court’s recent ruling on Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence is being widely touted as giving a green light to secessionist movements to gain statehood.
According to Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, “The decision finally removes all doubts that countries which still do not recognize the Republic of Kosovo could have.”
But this reading is largely wishful thinking by those who support secession.
The Court's non-binding advisory opinion responded to a narrow question posed by the United Nations General Assembly: whether declaring independence is legal under international law.
The judges rightly held that there is no international rule preventing a group from stating its intention or wish to form a state. But they said nothing about the terms and conditions that apply to following through on this intention – i.e., the act of secession itself.
Indeed, the Court sought to leave no doubt about this: “The question is narrow and specific... it does not ask whether or not Kosovo has achieved statehood.”
The judges contrasted their opinion with that handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada when it was asked to rule on Quebec’s right to secede unilaterally.
In that case, the question went far beyond a declaration of independence; the court was asked whether and under what conditions Quebec had a right to break away from Canada, under either the Canadian constitution or international law.
The Canadian judges held that international law granted no such unilateral right (and nor did the country's own constitution).
As the World Court pointed out, its judgment last week did not refute that crucial point: “The Court is not required by the question it has been asked to take a position…on whether international law generally confers an entitlement on entities within a State to break away from this [State].”
Moreover, the Court noted the radically different views expressed before it on whether self-determination in international law implies a unilateral right to secede.
By acknowledging the range and intensity of disagreement among states on a right to secede, the Court seems to have hinted that the necessary consent of the world community does not exist to establish firmly the existence of any such right.
Before concluding that there is now a “clear path” to Kosovo's independence, it is worth pondering the important questions that the Court did not answer (and was not asked by the General Assembly).
The Court was not asked, and thus did not rule on, whether international law requires that the final status of Kosovo protect the group and individual rights of minorities, whether Kosovar Serbs or Roma.
Likewise, the Court was not asked and did not rule on whether Serbia or, indeed, any other state in the world community is required to recognize Kosovo as an independent state.
Nor did the Court’s decision address the borders of an independent Kosovo, or whether and under what circumstances force could legally be used either to impose independence or to resist it.
If the fate of Kosovo – and the entire Balkan region – is to be guided by the global rule of law, these questions need to be answered, not swept under the table.
Under existing procedures, framing questions to the World Court is entirely a prerogative of states, either as contending parties or, as with the Kosovo opinion, operating through the UN. But the rights of persons and peoples, not just interests of states, are at stake in controversies such as this one.
To fulfill international justice today, we need a new kind of World Court, open to other voices.

De-Nationalizing the ECB’s Executive Board
The European Central Bank’s chief economist, Otmar Issing, may not be scheduled to retire until May 2006. But behind the scenes, maneuvering and politicking over his replacement are already in full swing.
If current practices are maintained, the choice for this key post will be made on the basis of nationality, not merit.
The only certainty about Mr. Issing’s successor at the present moment is that he or she will be a German.
This is because the big countries are acting as if they “own” seats on the Executive Board – that there is a “German chair”, a “Spanish chair”, an “Italian chair”, and so on.
They are getting away with their power grab even though it goes against the Maastricht Treaty, which excludes nationality as a criterion for membership on the Executive Board.
The pattern has been all too obvious.
First, there was the controversial appointment of the Spaniard Jose Manuel Gonzales-Paramo to replace his countryman Domingo Solans on the Executive Board in May 2004.
In May of this year, Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi will replace another Italian, the retiring Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa.
These appointments set a bad precedent, regardless of the merits of the individual members in question.
Current practice is blatantly unfair, because it excludes candidates from small countries from competing for the vacated seats.
This practice is also unwise.
Some of the best people serving the ECB – or who have served in the past – are from small countries.
Preventing small countries – as well as other big ones – from competing for specific vacant seats reduces the Executive Board’s potential competency.
Giving big countries permanent seats on the Executive Board also makes it easier for their politicians to control the ECB through the appointments process.
It is much more difficult to appoint a political puppet to the Board in a system of open competition than under the current scheme.
The last thing the ECB needs is a political crony of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder assuming Mr. Issing’s key post.
Of course, opening up the competition for Executive Board portfolios to all member countries does not guarantee the most qualified and politically independent person gets the job; it only increases the probability of such an outcome.
After all, member governments would still pick the candidates, and there can be no escaping politics in what is essentially a political process.
If member governments are intent on bad candidates, it will be impossible to avoid them.
Still, an open competitive process, even with all the inevitable political horse-trading and compromise that this entails, will most likely result in better Executive Board members than under the current system.
Aware of the danger that Schroeder may pick a dubious candidate for Issing’s post, senior ECB officials are already quietly discussing ways to outmaneuver him.
One proposal currently making the rounds in Frankfurt is to split Issing’s current portfolio in two, transferring part of the chief economist’s responsibilities to another Board member.
Another is to decouple the economics portfolio from the “German chair” altogether.
The question is whether Germany will respond by claiming that it “owns” Issing’s portfolio as well as his chair.
So far, the big countries have been able to get away with their power grab because the small ones have been too disunited to launch an effective counterattack.
Belgium, for example, complains constantly about its lack of representation on the Executive Board, but it has been more interested in demanding equal treatment with the Netherlands in the ECB than pursuing a common strategy with its neighbor to counter the big countries’ unwarranted assumption of permanent seats.
The new EU members from Central and Eastern Europe, in particular, have a big stake in how the issue plays out.
Many of the new members will be small countries who will introduce the euro someday and will want to have a seat on the Executive Board.
If that is not possible because the original big countries have locked up most of the six seats on the Board for themselves, public opinion in Europe – which is broader than German, French, Spanish, and Italian opinion – could turn against the ECB.
For this reason alone, the competition for the limited seats on the Executive Board must be an open one.

Will the Fourth Industrial Revolution Serve Sustainability?
STOCKHOLM – Silicon Valley leaders tell us that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will bring untold benefits.
They say it is already underway and accelerating, powered by artificial intelligence and other technologies, and warn that we will be left eating dust if we don’t get with the program.
This upheaval – which also reflects the impact of robotics, bio- and nanotechnology, 5G, and the Internet of Things (IoT) – is a general-purpose revolution.
Its leaders and their boosters promise that it will help societies to tackle climate change, address poverty and inequality, and stem the dramatic loss of biodiversity.
The revolution might play out like that.
Or it might not.
Consider the most recent digital revolution, which brought us Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and changed the way information flows around the world.
At first, the ability to connect to others online, and to create and share digital content seamlessly through ever-growing virtual social networks, seemed straightforwardly beneficial.
But today, the global flood of misinformation enabled by these platforms is making it more difficult to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and tackle climate change.
Few realized what was happening until it was too late, and now we are dealing with the fallout.
So, how can societies minimize the risk of inadvertent, ignorant, or willfully malicious use of the next generation of technology?
My work has increasingly focused on the collision of two worlds.
The technosphere comprises the stuff that humans have created, which amounts to an estimated 30 trillion tons, or 50 kilograms (110 pounds) per square meter of the Earth’s surface.
The biosphere is the thin layer clinging to the Earth’s surface where life thrives, and where humans have enjoyed a 10,000-year stretch of relatively stable climate.
I first became interested in the relationship between these worlds while exploring the growth of semi-automated global early-warning systems for disease control.
This made me appreciate how deeply technology alters human, organizational, and machine behavior.
Sometimes that influence is linear, simple, and direct.
But more often than not, the effects of technological change are indirect; they move through complex webs of causation and become visible to us only after a long time.
Social media are a good example of this.
The technosphere is all around us.
It is on track to become so-called “cognitive infrastructure,” with the ability to process information, reason, remember, learn, solve problems, and at times even make decisions with minimal human intervention through increased automation and machine learning.
In evolutionary terms, this may prove to be a giant leap.
But decisions regarding the technosphere’s design and direction must reflect social goals and the state of the planet.
Building a more sustainable future therefore requires us to rethink some deeply held assumptions about the role of technology, and artificial intelligence in particular.
The biggest imperative may be to broaden the dominant “AI for climate change” narrative.
In its simplest form, this narrative focuses on using AI to predict climate, or to optimize energy systems or traffic flows.
But the climate system is fundamentally connected to the biosphere, with its biodiversity, forests, oceans, and agricultural ecosystems.
Developing and deploying AI responsibly to tackle urgent sustainability challenges requires embracing this connection with the living planet, and our role in it.
Moreover, framing AI’s contribution in terms of optimization and efficiency is the wrong way to think about bolstering the long-term resilience of people and the planet.
Resilience – the ability to rebound from shocks and adapt to changing conditions – requires diversity and redundancy.
A city with one huge freeway through its center is vulnerable to gridlock if hit by a flash flood or terrorist attack.
One that has many routes from one place to another is more resilient.
Systems that are optimized to maximize output (say, of a particular crop) are prone to shocks and changing circumstances.
Optimizing agricultural land for maximum yields using predictive analytics and automation is a tempting strategy, but it could accelerate loss of local ecological knowledge, amplify existing inequalities, and increase reliance on monoculture in response to commercial pressures.
AI’s potential to help address the climate challenge lies not in optimizing systems, but in augmenting people’s capacities to become stewards of the biosphere.
Such a broader view is urgently needed today.
But there are two big risks in striving to direct intelligent machines to foster biosphere stewardship.
The first is hype.
As the pressures on our planet and the climate system increase, so will the hope that AI solutions can help “solve” deeply complex social, economic, and environmental challenges.
Our knowledge about whether AI actually offers large climate benefits (and to whom) is limited, and existing assessments are often wildly optimistic, given what we know of technological evolution.
All claims must be rigorously and independently tested as AI technologies evolve and diffuse over time.
The second risk is acceleration.
The deployment of AI systems and related technologies like IoT, 5G, and robotics may well lead to more rapid loss of biosphere resilience and increased extraction of fossil fuels and the raw materials that underpin these technologies.
For example, oil and gas firms are increasingly seeking to cut costs through digitization.
According to one estimate, the market for digital services in the fossil-fuel sector could grow 500% in the next five years, saving oil producers about $150 billion annually.
Digitization, automation, and AI have untapped potential both to strengthen sustainability and to optimize exploitation.
To harness the Fourth Industrial Revolution to sustainability, we need to start directing its technologies better and stronger now.

The Quality of Mercy
PRINCETON – The recent release of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, the only person convicted of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, sparked outrage.
Around the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles, an American football team, offered a second chance to former star Michael Vick, who was convicted of running a dog-fighting operation in which unsuccessful fighters were tortured and killed.
And William Calley, who commanded the platoon that massacred hundreds of Vietnamese civilians at the village of My Lai in 1968, has now broken his media silence and apologized for his actions.
When should we forgive or show mercy to wrongdoers?
Many societies treat crimes involving cruelty to animals far too lightly, but Vick’s penalty – 23 months in prison – was substantial.
In addition to imprisonment, he missed two years of his playing career, and millions of dollars in earnings.
If Vick were never to play football again, he would suffer punishment well beyond that imposed by the court.
Vick has expressed remorse.
Perhaps more importantly, he has turned words into deeds, volunteering at an animal shelter and working with the Humane Society of the United States to oppose dog fighting.
It is hard to see what good would come from not allowing him to complete his rehabilitation and return to doing what he does best.
Megrahi was convicted of murdering 270 people, and sentenced to life imprisonment.
He had served only seven years when Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish Justice Minister, released him on compassionate grounds, based on a medical report that Megrahi has terminal cancer, and only three months to live.
The question of remorse has not arisen, because Megrahi has never admitted guilt, and did not drop an appeal against his conviction until just before his release.
Doubts have been raised about whether Megrahi is really near death.
Only the prison doctor, it seems, was prepared to say that he did not have more than three months to live, while four specialists refused to say how long he might have.
There has also been speculation that Megrahi’s release was related to negotiations over oil contracts between Britain and Libya.
Finally, some question whether Megrahi really was the perpetrator of the crime, and this may have played a role in MacAskill’s decision (although, if so, that would have been better left to the courts to resolve).
But let us leave such questions aside for the moment.
Assuming that Megrahi was guilty, and that he was released because he has only a short time to live, does a prisoner’s terminal illness justify compassionate release?
The answer might depend on the nature of the crime, the length of the sentence, and the proportion of it that remains to be served.
For a pickpocket who has served half of a two-year sentence, it would be excessively harsh to insist on the sentence being served in full if that meant that he would die in prison, rather than with his family.
But to release a man who served only seven years of a life sentence for mass murder is a very different matter.
As the victims’ relatives point out, in planning his crime, Megrahi showed no compassion.
Why, they ask, should we show compassion to him?
MacAskill, in a statement to the Scottish Parliament defending his decision, refrained from quoting from the best-known speech on mercy in the English language – that of Portia in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice – but Portia’s words would have fitted the core of his statement.
Portia acknowledges that Shylock is under no obligation to show mercy to Antonio, who is in breach of his agreement to him.
“The quality of mercy is not strained” – that is, constrained, or obligatory – she tells Shylock, but rather something that falls freely, like rain.
MacAskill acknowledged that Megrahi himself showed no compassion, but rightly points out that this alone is not a reason to deny him compassion in his final days.
He then appeals to the values of humanity, compassion, and mercy as “the beliefs we seek to live by” and frames his decision as being true to Scottish values.
We can reasonably disagree with MacAskill’s decision, but we should acknowledge that – unless there is more going on than appears on the surface – he was motivated by some of the finest values we are capable of exercising.
And, if we believe that Megrahi was not sufficiently punished for his crime, what are we to make of the treatment of former Lieutenant William Calley?
In 1971, Calley was convicted of the murder of “no less than 22 Vietnamese civilians of undetermined age and sex.” He was also convicted of assault with intent to murder a Vietnamese child.
Yet three days – yes, days – after his conviction, President Richard Nixon ordered that he be released from prison and allowed to serve his sentence in a comfortable two-bedroom house.
There he lived with a female companion and a staff to assist him.
After three years, he was released even from this form of detention.
Calley always claimed that he was following orders.
Captain Ernest Medina, his commanding officer, ordered him to burn the village down and pollute its wells, but there is no clear evidence that the order included killing non-combatants – and of course if such an order were issued, it should not have been obeyed.
(Medina was acquitted of murder.)
After decades of refusing to speak publicly, Calley, who is now 66, recently said that “not a day goes by” when he does not feel remorse “for what happened that day in My Lai.” One wonders if the relatives of those murdered at My Lai are more ready to forgive Calley than the relatives of those killed at Lockerbie are to forgive Megrahi.

Muppets and Middle East Peace
NEW YORK – Can furry puppets in Day-Glo colors provide the lessons we need to calm the fires of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
The Muppet empire is now worldwide.
Those who grew up with the children’s educational TV show Sesame Street know that it gives five-year-olds easy-to-take lessons in literacy, numeracy, and social skills.
But Sesame Street has a loftier agenda, finding partners in the developing world – including Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan – to bring the fuzzy little creatures, with their message of peace and tolerance, to local audiences.
A new documentary, “When Muppets Dream of Peace,” tracks the harrowing joint production of Sesame Street in Israel and Palestine, with a Jordanian production team brought in to help facilitate.
This program, like so many educational or cultural Israeli-Palestinian partnerships, began in starry-eyed idealism.
But, based on the film – and on a recent panel discussion with the filmmakers and a Muppets spokesman in New York City – it was undermined by a common flaw in such partnerships.
The original plan – like with so many of these programs – was based on a notion of parity: Israeli and Palestinian production teams would work together.
But the Palestinian partners vetoed that idea – “We aren’t there yet,” they explained.
Could they have a stand-alone Palestinian Sesame Street?
No funding for that, came the reply.
The Palestinian team finally agreed to parallel productions with a major “cultural exchange” element – rather than creating segments together, they would produce a series with Palestinian Muppets and adults that also incorporated cartoons and mini-documentaries produced by the Israelis and Jordanians.
The other two teams would do likewise.
Some unifying characters – such as an Arab- Israeli girl who explains each “side” to the other – would create a measure of continuity.
The New York-based management wanted the Palestinians and Israelis to portray each other in a humanizing way.
Again, the Palestinians resisted.
Rather than focus on creating scenarios that showed Israelis – even Israeli kids – in a positive light, they wanted to focus on showing Palestinian culture in a positive light, portraying Palestinian youths as role models, and providing images to kids that offered alternatives to violence.
But then reality intervened again.
A suicide bomber attacked in Israel, and, in retaliation, the Israel Defense Forces took over Ramallah, where the tiny Palestinian Sesame Street studio was located.
Day after day, the talented Palestinian team of animators, puppeteers, designers, cameramen, and producers could not get to work – even as the Israeli team was churning out their own material in a brightly lit, well-funded studio in Tel Aviv.
Then the IDF occupied the TV station itself and destroyed it, along with the team’s computers and cameras.
The documentary’s footage of shot-out computer screens and piles of smashed printers and cameras – under graffiti reading “Palestine Never” – makes one despair.
Meanwhile, New York was growing impatient, letting the Palestinian team know that their segments were late – and, under what was essentially a military occupation, the Palestinians began to rethink whether this was the right kind of project to which to devote their energies.
The New York producer overseeing the project, a single mother, was reluctant initially to visit Ramallah – so the Palestinian team’s inability to produce their segments on time was, like so many aspects of the Palestinian experience, hidden behind a barrier of fear, not fully witnessed, and thus not fully comprehended.
The co-production has ended. But there is a Palestinian Sesame Street and an Israeli Sesame Street, and there are positive Arab-Israeli characters in the Israeli version.
And the creators of these programs, together with the filmmakers behind “When Muppets Dream of Peace,” offer important lessons for all of us.
One quote from a Palestinian TV production team member stayed with me: “This is a shotgun wedding,” he explained when he was advocating for a Palestine-only Sesame Street. “And we want a divorce.”
The Palestinian team is utterly indistinguishable, superficially, from their European or Israeli counterparts: they are hip, young, talented, sophisticated, and more than anything they want to work to create a positive environment for their kids – or at least a psychological respite from the reality of occupation, violence, and war.
But how often does the outside world – even the best-intentioned donors and program creators – reach out to Palestinian civil society on its own terms, without insisting on that “shotgun wedding?”
How often are resources invested in Palestinian films, books, newspapers, high schools, dance troupes, teachers, etc. without requiring the recipients to make friendly gestures to Israel?
Many civil-society elements in the Muslim world have turned their backs on possible partnerships with Israeli counterparts.
One Egyptian actor was boycotted at home for merely appearing in Cannes with an Israeli actress.
But I am certain that the more intently outsiders invest in Palestinian civil society on its own terms, the less exasperated the Palestinian intelligentsia – and the Muslim world – will become with the often-coerced terms of Palestine's creativity.
A vibrant Palestinian civil society could become more flexible and open toward possible partnerships – including more natural, holistic Israeli-Palestinian joint ventures – thus benefiting the region as a whole.
The Muppets have taught generations of kids worldwide how to count to ten and share cookies.
In the 1970’s in the United States, they taught us about an interracial couple on Sesame Street.
In South Africa, the creators asked for – and got – a puppet that was an HIV-positive child, since acceptance of such kids was a lesson that local educators told the New York team they needed to teach.
In the Sesame Street of Palestine and Israel, the failure of the joint venture was really a success: the Muppets and their creators have given us another valuable lesson, this time in how – and how not – to help others.

The Battle for French Pension Reform
PARIS – A year after a proposed fuel tax triggered the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protests, France faces another crisis, this time over pension reform.
Mass demonstrations have now gone on for more than 50 days, not letting up even for Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Strikes have disrupted the operations of both the French National Railway Company (SNCF) and the RATP bus and subway network, leading to more than €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in losses for those companies.
The strike in the transportation system has now ended, but the confrontation is far from over.
French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed pension reforms are both far-reaching and needed.
Under the current mandatory-pension system, the accounting schemes for determining benefits are all over the map, differing substantially by sector and occupation.
The system is the outcome of a long-going historical process aimed at extending social protections in old age, based on the prevailing principles of the immediate post-World War II era.
The Macron government’s proposals are bold. But they are not intended to disrupt pay-as-you-go schemes, nor do they undermine the broader principle of intergenerational solidarity.
The total pension payments for a given year will still be financed by social-security contributions from active workers’ earnings in the same year.
The legal minimum retirement age of 62, most recently set in 2010, will remain for now.
And the new system will still cost around 14% of GDP (which is much higher than in most other European countries).
But Macron’s proposals for a “systemic” overhaul are entirely different from previous reforms, the main goal of which was to balance the books by tweaking certain “parameters” across the 42 existing pension schemes.
The new program would create a universal system in which, as Macron stated, “a contribution of one euro will give the same rights to all.”
The same rules would apply to all working individuals, whatever their profession or employment status.
And the contribution rate would stay the same for total earnings up to €120,000 per year, providing a €1,000 minimum monthly pension benefit for those who spent their careers at the minimum wage.
Clearly, the reform would require the gradual elimination of special pension plans, which currently allow some railway employees to retire ten years earlier than most other workers.
The government has stood firm on phasing out privileged schemes in the name of equality; but it has agreed to a very gradual transition, such that 60% of current eligible employees would not be affected.
It is generally agreed that a points-based scheme is the most transparent option, because benefits follow directly from contributions, which is not always the case with basic annuity schemes.
As such, the system enhances job mobility, and is more in step with workplace realities.
By assigning additional points, the government can encourage a more seamless integration of other redistributive arrangements such as child credits, unemployment benefits, or minimum monthly pensions.
But reforming how benefits are calculated will change the entitlements that some beneficiaries receive.
There are still questions about which groups will be most affected, and how, and this has contributed to the general climate of distrust.
Not surprisingly, those benefiting from privileged schemes are standing tall on the picket lines.
But many civil servants – not least schoolteachers – will also be affected, because their benefits will be determined by average lifetime pay instead of their earnings upon retirement.
Moreover, French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe has made the pill harder to swallow by insisting that the reform package include a new “equilibrium age” of 64 (to be reached in 2027), which would reduce benefits for people who retire early, and increase benefits for those who postpone retirement.
Philippe is correctly concerned about the financial sustainability of the whole system. But by pushing for this measure, he appeared to break an earlier promise by Macron that the retirement age would remain 62.
As a result, the French Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT), the main reformist union, turned on the government, forcing another round of negotiations.
Philippe eventually withdrew his proposal, provided that a special conference addresses the financial issue within a period of three months.
The challenge now is clear.
Without budging on the principles of universality and equality, the government needs to undermine opposition to the broader reform package.
On the issue of the transition period, it has stated that the new provisions will apply only to workers born in or after 1975.
It has also agreed to exceptions for early retirements linked to arduous and hazardous working conditions, and it may offer some additional compensation for teachers and a few other groups.
None of these changes will make the reform program simpler; but they are necessary.
The larger crisis over pension reform reflects longstanding divisions in French society.
The current conflict has featured the usual confrontation between those responsible for reforming existing institutions and those fighting to preserve their vested rights.
It has also exposed a rift on the left, between unions that reject the reform proposals outright and unions that are open to negotiation.
The more radical unions see the fight as part of a broader ideological struggle against economic neoliberalism; accordingly, they suspect that the Macron government is pursuing a funded system.
The more moderate unions acknowledge (albeit not publicly) that demographic realities – longer life expectancies, declining birth rates – require a higher retirement age.
Public opinion reflects these divisions.
The public supports the principle of equality, but is suspicious of the proposed changes.
Because so many French citizens have a stake in preserving the status quo, the strikers have enjoyed somewhat strong public support.
Looking ahead, the government has been waiting for commuters and others who rely on public transportation to lose patience with service disruptions.
Strikes cannot continue forever.
At the end of the day, the government has a parliamentary majority with which to pass a reform package, possibly one that includes a few concessions that will reduce its overall consistency.
Having campaigned on the promise of reform, Macron cannot afford to abandon the effort now.
Nor can France.

What Next after Failed Sanctions on Iran?
LOS ANGELES amp#45;amp#45; The approval of fresh sanctions on Iran marks the third time that the United Nations Security Council has been galvanized to stem the Islamic Republic’s feared uranium enrichment efforts.
Unfortunately, the new sanctions are unlikely to be any more effective than the first two rounds.
Consider the two earlier Security Council resolutions.
The December 2006 resolution curbed international assistance to Iran in mastering the nuclear fuel cycle.
The March 2007 resolution called for “vigilance and restraint” in the sale of heavy weapons to Iran and avoidance of new grants, financial assistance, or concessional loans.
Neither moved the country’s ruling mullahs. Few expect a different outcome from the new sanctions, which authorize international interception of Iranian contraband and tightened monitoring of the regime’s financial institutions, along with travel limitations and asset freezes applied to people and companies involved in Iran’s nuclear program.
The failure of targeted UN sanctions should come as no surprise.
The US has been on the sanctions treadmill for years.
Between 2003 and 2007 the US Treasury Department brought litigation against 94 companies for violating the ban against trade and investment in Iran. The State Department imposed sanctions 111 times against foreign entities that engaged in proliferation or terrorism-related activities with Iran.
And both departments have used their power to freeze financial assets or access to the US financial system.
The results amounted to little more than a pin prick.
Iran’s nuclear programs continued to be financed by international commerce.
In 1994, Iran exported $37 billion in goods; by 2007, the figure had nearly doubled, to $70 billion.
In roughly the same period, Iran’s imports also soared, from $22 billion in 1994 to $45 billion in 2006.
Evaluating two decades of US sanctions to curb Iran’s nuclear appetite, the US Congress’s Government Accountability Office recently concluded that the results are “unclear,” adding with candid obliqueness that “some evidence, such as foreign firms signing contracts to invest in Iran’s energy and Iran’s continued proliferation efforts, raise questions about the extent of the sanctions’ impact.”
Not only have sanctions failed to halt Iran’s fuel cycle programs, but so have other avenues.
The European Union’s multiple offers of political and economic inducements went nowhere, as did cajoling by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
To be sure Iran offered, in 2005 and subsequently, to tether its program to international co-management, which arguably could have placed resident international monitors on site. But both the international community and Iran failed to follow through, and now that opportunity has increasingly become moot as Iranian engineers gain confidence in their handiwork.
Some hope that the next US administration can stem Iran’s nuclear ambitions through bilateral diplomacy. But Europe’s negotiating experience raises doubts about that prospect, as Iran remains unequivocal about never abandoning its nuclear fuel cycle program.
Assuming that concern over Iran’s nuclear “breakout” capacity mounts, this leaves the US and its allies with three options, each with its own risks.
First, a naval blockade (reminiscent of the Cuban missile crisis) that halted both Iran’s oil exports and imports of refined fuel would cripple the country’s economy. But the US military would have to be able to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world’s oil supply passes.
A halt in Iran’s oil exports alone would dramatically upset international oil markets, and the Iranian leadership would likely dig in its heels to continue, if not accelerate, nuclear development.
Second, while a military strike would slow Iran’s nuclear program, facilities could be rebuilt in the absence of inspectors to find and destroy remnants, regime change, and/or military occupation.
Moreover, the attack shock could trigger Iranian vengeance regionally and elsewhere, with a global economic impact far exceeding that implied by a blockade.
This leaves an unsettling fallback option. An Iran on the cusp of becoming a nuclear-armed state confronting a nuclear-armed Israel bringing its bomb out of the basement.
In that event, there remains the hope that mutual nuclear deterrence will promote mutual common sense.
Absent a dramatic improvement in the Middle East’s grim political landscape, the failure of deterrence would bring the sum of all the fears of our nuclear age upon us.

Russia and the Kosovo Card
TBILISI – Look before you leap is as sound a principle in foreign policy as it is in life.
Yet, once again, the Bush administration is preparing to leap into the unknown.
Even though lack of foresight is universally viewed as a leading cause of its Iraq debacle, the United States (with British backing probable) is now preparing to recognize Kosovo’s independence unilaterally – irrespective of the consequences for Europe and the world.
Kosovo has been administered since 1999 by a United Nations mission guarded by NATO troops, although it remains formally a part of Serbia.
But, with Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority demanding its own state, and with Russia refusing to recognize UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari’s plan for conditional independence, the US is preparing to go it alone.
Instead of thinking what Ahtisaari deemed unthinkable, a partition of Kosovo with a small part of the north going to Serbia and the rest linked to the Kosovars ethnic brethren in Albania or a separate state, the US plans to act without the UN’s blessing, arguing that only an independent Kosovo will bring stability to the Western Balkans.
That argument is debatable – and the record of the Kosovar government suggests that it is wrong.
But the US position is unambiguously misguided in not foreseeing that the “Kosovo precedent” will incite instability and potentially even violence elsewhere.
Why the rush to give Kosovo independence?
Many serious disputes have gone unresolved for decades.
The Kashmir question has lingered since 1947, the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus since 1974, and Israel’s occupation of the West Bank from 1967.
Yet no one is suggesting that unilateral solutions be imposed in these potential flashpoints.
Nevertheless, the US – and most European Union members – argue that Kosovo’s situation is sui generis and will set no legally binding international precedent.
But Russia sees things very differently.
Indeed, it may seek to use this precedent to re-establish its authority over the nations and territories that were once part of the Soviet Union.
Spain and Cyprus with their worries over secessionist-minded regions, are worried by any possible precedent.
Romania fears the fallout from Kosovo’s unilaterally gaining independence on neighboring Moldova.
The worry is that Russia will unilaterally recognize the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transdnistria, which Russian troops and criminal gangs have been propping up for 16 years.
Ukraine – the great prize in Russia’s bid to recapture its former sphere of influence – is also deeply anxious.
It fears that Russia will encourage separatist tendencies in Crimea, where the ethnic Russian population forms a majority.
(Crimea was ceded to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev only in 1954).
Russia may decide to abuse the Kosovo precedent further to divide Ukraine’s population between Russian speakers and Ukrainian speakers.
But the biggest risks posed by unilateral recognition of Kosovo’s independence are in the South Caucasus, a region that abuts the tinderbox of today’s Middle East.
Here, there is a real danger that Russia may recognize breakaway regions in the South Caucasus, – and back them more strongly than it does now.
Even before Vladimir Putin became Russia’s president, the Kremlin was making mischief in Georgia, issuing Russian passports to citizens of Abkhazia (the largest breakaway region) and pouring money into its economy.
Russia’s supposed “peacekeeping troops” in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia’s other secession-minded region, have in fact protected their rebel governments.
Russia has also been enforcing a complete trade embargo on Georgia in the hope of weakening the resolve of its pro-Western president, Mikhail Saakashvili.
Should Russia recognize Abkhazia’s independence, Saakashvili might be tempted to respond militarily to prevent his country from unraveling.
Renewed conflict in Abkhazia would not only bring the risk of open warfare with Russia, but strain relations with Armenia, as there are near to 50,000 Armenians in Abkhazia who support the breakaway government.
Another risk in the South Caucasus is that Russia (with Armenian support) will recognize Nagorno-Karabakh’s self-proclaimed independence from Azerbaijan.
Nagorno-Karabakh, historically Armenian, endured a bloody secessionist war between1988 and 1994, with 30,000 killed and 14% of Azerbaijan’s territory occupied by Russian-backed Armenian forces.
Since then, oil has fuelled an Azeri military buildup. So the government in Baku is far more prepared to respond to renewed warfare than it was in the 1990’s.
Moreover, it has neighboring Turkey on its side.
Turkey is already enforcing a punitive economic embargo on Armenia, including closure of its border.
Military projections by the US have repeatedly suggested that Azerbaijan would lose such a battle, even with newly purchased equipment and Turkish military support.
Armenian forces are well dug in and have received a significant boost from Russia’s diversion of heavy weaponry to Armenia from some recently closed Georgian military bases.
Iran also must be factored into this equation, as it is becoming a strategic investor by building an oil refinery just across its border in Armenia, partly as a security measure in case of a US attack and partly to relieve its petrol shortages.
Moreover, Iran remains eager to contain Azerbaijani revanchist claims over the large Azeri minority in northern Iran.
The conflicts in Transdnistria and the South Caucasus are usually called “frozen conflicts,” because not much has happened since they began in the early 1990’s.
Any unilateral move to give Kosovo its independence is likely to unfreeze them – fast and bloodily.
And such potential bloodshed on Russia’s border may give Vladimir Putin the pretext he may desire to extend his rule beyond its constitutionally mandated end next March.

The Myth of Climate Wars?
NEW YORK – In the years leading up to Syria’s civil war, the country endured three consecutive record-breaking droughts.
By forcing internal displacement, the droughts arguably contributed to the social tensions that erupted in popular protests in 2011.
But that does not mean that the Syrian conflict is a “climate war.”
As extreme weather events proliferate, it’s becoming increasingly easy to find a link between climate change and violent confrontations.
In Sudan, the ethnic cleansing carried out by former President Omar al-Bashir has been tied to the Sahara Desert’s southward expansion, which fueled social unrest by exacerbating food insecurity.
Territorial disputes in the South China Sea have also been connected to food-security concerns, rooted in competition over access to fishing areas.
Some now warn of a “brewing water war” between Egypt and Ethiopia, triggered by the latter’s construction of a dam on the Nile River.
But the “climate war” narrative is deeply flawed.
From Syria to Sudan, today’s conflicts are the result of multiple complicated and interrelated factors, from ethno-religious tensions to protracted political repression.
While the effects of climate change can exacerbate social and political instability, climate change did not cause these wars.
This nuance is important, not least for the sake of accountability: climate change must not be used to duck responsibility for resolving or averting violent confrontations.
Still, military and climate experts argue, climate change is a “threat multiplier,” and thus remains an important national security issue.
Climate advocates and academics, however, have long avoided or rejected discussions of “climate security” – not to diminish the risks that climate change poses, but because they fear that framing climate change as a security issue will undermine efforts to mitigate those risks, by enabling the incremental securitization of climate action.
Securitization is often a political tactic, in which leaders construct a security threat to justify deploying extraordinary, even illegal measures, that infringe on people’s rights.
If the fight against climate change is securitized, it could, for example, be used to rationalize new restrictions on the movement of people, enabled by and reinforcing anti-migrant sentiment.
Framing climate as a security issue can also challenge already-strained international cooperation on climate governance, while driving investment away from necessary interventions – such as the shift to a low-carbon economy – toward advancing military preparedness.
The accompanying apocalyptic discourse, moreover, could well lead to public disengagement, further weakening democratic accountability.
Yet, even as some United Nations member states express concern about linking climate change more closely to security, most countries are moving in precisely that direction.
In 2013, the American Security Project reported that 70% of countries view climate change as a threat to their security, and at least 70 national militaries already have clear plans in place to address this threat.
The UN Security Council is also becoming more active in the climate security field.
After recognizing the role of climate change in the Lake Chad conflict (Resolution 2349), the Council held its first debates on the relationship between climate change and security, with the participation of a large and diverse group of member states.
Given the impact of climate change on issues like migration and health, decoupling discussions of climate action from national security considerations may never have been feasible.
On the other hand, linking climate change to security can positively contribute to mobilizing climate action.
The key to avoiding the pitfalls of securitization is to move beyond paradigms – which overemphasize military-focused “hard security” narratives – that continue to shape security policy and public discourse.
One way to achieve that is to take a more gender-inclusive approach to conflict prevention and resolution.
Research shows that women are more likely to pursue a collaborative approach to peacemaking, with actors organizing across ethnic, cultural, and sectarian divides.
Such an approach “increases the prospects of long-term stability and reduces the likelihood of state failure, conflict onset, and poverty.”
When women participate in peace negotiations, the resulting agreements are 35% more likely to last at least 15 years.
Sustainable peace is possible only by recognizing the necessity of local women’s leadership, who have relevant expertise and yet are currently excluded from national and multilateral frameworks.
After all, if policy decisions are to meet the needs of the affected communities, members of those communities must have a seat at the table.
For example, in Indonesia, Farwiza Farhan has acquired unique insights from years of facilitating community-inclusive forest conversation that respects local stakeholders.
In Somalia, Ilwad Elman has proved her ability to navigate intersectional peace-building efforts through her organization, Elman Peace.
Of course, there is also an imperative to give more women the tools they need to join in this process.
The interconnections identified in the UN Sustainable Development Goals provide a functional roadmap for delivering the needed equity.
In particular, improving reproductive health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) of girls and women is one of the most cost-effective ways both to mitigate climate change (SDG 13) and to empower them as community leaders (SDG 5).
Rather than resisting the securitization of climate, advocates and policymakers should be advancing what the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute calls “the climatization of security.”
This is best done by using security to increase the salience of climate action, highlighting the shortcomings of current security frameworks, and promoting gender inclusiveness and local leadership as holistic and long-term solutions for fostering local, regional, and international peace.

Lessons from America's Fiscal Recklessness
George W. Bush has done more to wreck US economic policy than any other President in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had taken a decade to construct, and that could take another decade to re-create.
In doing so, Bush has risked America's long-term economic health and social stability.
Because the long-term budgetary challenges that the US is so badly mismanaging are not unique, America's fiscal blunders provide important lessons for other countries.
The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while running up massive public debts, leaving repayment to the future.
This trick can last a few years, but sooner rather than later budget deficits and growing public debt force a painful policy reversal.
Yet a cynical politician can buy himself re-election and perhaps be in retirement when the crisis arrives.
One would imagine that after hundreds of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility around the world in recent decades, voters would be allergic to such tricks.
Yet Bush is doing it again, buying popularity today by doling out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and even raising expenditure on education and health.
The result is a budget deficit equivalent to more than 5% of GDP.
What's worse is that America's long-term budgetary prospects were already troubling before Bush began his reckless policies.
The US population is aging, so there will be a sharp increase in the costs of publicly funded health care and pension systems.
Careful calculations show that future revenues under the tax policies favored by Bush are likely to fall tens of trillions of dollars short of the costs of public pensions, health care, and other fiscal spending expected by the public.
At some point in the future, there will thus need to be steep increases in tax collections, sharp cuts in public spending, or both, to correct Bush's actions.
So why does the public support his policies?
Because the public has little understanding or concern about these long-term consequences, even though they will eventually hurt most Americans.
The richest taxpayers are, of course, happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts.
Amazingly, the richest 5% of US taxpayers received almost half of the tax cuts, and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95%--the middle class and the poor--to bear most of the future spending cuts and tax increases.
Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor and middle-class voters that they should be happy, too, without telling them that they will have to pay for their small tax cuts with much larger cuts in future government services if his administration's policies prevail in the long term.
If Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they already rode this fiscal "roller coaster" once in the past 20 years.
Ronald Reagan also came to office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending.
The result was a huge budget deficit by the middle of the 1980's.
Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped win him re-election in 1984.
It then took over a decade--starting in Reagan's second term, and continuing through the terms of George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton--to get the budget back to surplus.
Of course, this meant approving fresh tax increases, which cost George Bush, Sr. his re-election and led to the polarized politics of the 1990's.
History will almost certainly repeat.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that today's budget deficits will eventually force government social spending to be cut sharply.
They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
But the US public strongly supports these social programs.
So the right-wing strategy of cutting taxes first in order to force cuts in social programs later will fail, and eventually tax rates will have to rise.
Others in the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are important for pulling the US out of recession.
This argument is also mistaken.
America's economy could have recovered without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more robustly.
In any event, it is a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on the short-run business cycle.
There are two vital lessons for other countries.
The first is that the looming US budget deficits will sooner or later limit America's international power.
Americans supported the Iraq war only because they didn't have to pay for it with increased taxes.
When Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less likely to support expensive military operations abroad.
Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally as the public grapples with the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries ought to plan their budgets taking into account the rising fiscal costs of an aging population.
Long-term budgetary conditions are rarely in clear view of taxpayers or the parliament.
Governments should be required to submit long-term budget assessments together with their annual budget proposals, in order to reduce the tendency towards short-run political manipulation of the budget.
The US can serve as an early warning to other countries.
The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try this at home."

The Promise of Bank Mergers
BARCELONA – The banking business has fallen on hard times.
The combination of persistent low interest rates, increasing regulatory compliance costs, and the rise of new competitors taking advantage of financial technologies (fintech for short) has produced, in Europe in particular, excess capacity and low profitability – and a strong temptation to merge.
In a difficult market, mergers – by enabling banks to cut costs, share information-technology platforms, and increase market power, thereby relieving pressure on margins and rebuilding capital – make sense.
And the banks know it.
Witness the recent merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, both of which have faced huge declines in market capitalization.
So a wave of mergers may be on the way.
The question is whether that approach really can solve banks’ problems and benefit society.
To be sure, mergers and acquisitions are not always a matter of escaping trouble.
In fact, M&A activity – both the number and size of transactions – was picking up before the 2008 global financial crisis, including across borders within and beyond the eurozone.
After peaking in 2007, such activity diminished, as domestic restructuring took precedence, particularly in countries such as Greece and Spain, which had to implement difficult adjustment programs.
Moreover, the M&A approach does not always work.
In October 2007, a consortium formed by the Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis, and Banco Santander acquired ABN AMRO – the world’s biggest bank takeover to date.
RBS and Fortis failed soon after and had to be rescued.
Nonetheless, supervisory bodies favor mergers to save banks in trouble.
Competition authorities tend to be more reluctant, recognizing the danger that large-scale mergers can consolidate an anti-competitive market structure, while creating even more “too big to fail” banks that may cause financial instability in the future.
But they are often overruled or compelled to acquiesce.
The US Department of Justice agreed to the merger between Wells Fargo and Wachovia, among others, soon after the 2008 financial crisis, and the UK Office of Fair Trade was overruled in the merging of HBOS and Lloyds.
Competition is not the only source of merger-related tension among authorities.
There is also friction between national supervisors, who prefer domestic mergers, and supranational supervisors, who prefer cross-border mergers within their jurisdiction (the eurozone, in the European Central Bank’s case).
The benefits of cross-border consolidation are that market power is diluted in a large market, and more diversification is obtained, though these gains come at the price of weakened cost synergies.
From the banks’ perspective, cross-border mergers may potentially be the better option, as long as they occur within a single supervisory framework.
That way, they can benefit from common supervision and resolution.
The eurozone’s new supervisory framework, supervised by the ECB and possessing a common resolution authority, reflects this recognition of the benefits of cross-border mergers.
But Europe lags when it comes to such mergers, owing to a broader lack of financial integration.
Indeed, in the European Union, member countries’ own banks tend to be the dominant players in the domestic market – say, BNP Paribas in France or UniCredit in Italy.
In the United States, by contrast, the same large banks – such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo – tend to dominate a large number of different states.
US banks have had more space to diversify.
For European banks – which must navigate vast differences in culture, language, and law in pursuing cross-border mergers – this has been much more difficult, especially because many of them also need to cut overcapacity drastically. As a result, in the near term, European banks are more likely to pursue domestic – or, at most, regional – consolidation.
For the United Kingdom, which voted in June to “Brexit” the EU, the situation is particularly complicated.
The UK long benefited from an open policy on acquisitions by foreign banks, which allowed, for example, the Spanish Santander Group to bid for Britain’s Abbey National in 2001.
But Brexit will probably move supervision of UK-based banks out of the EU framework, raising the cost of cross-border deals and implying a loss to British consumers.
As the UK banking sector’s competitiveness suffers, the temptation to return to the kind of light-touch regulation that enabled the crisis in the first place could intensify.
As for the rest of Europe’s banks, now might be the time to consider the merger option.
Mergers are no silver bullet, but they could help to alleviate serious problems relatively quickly – though, in the longer term, the banks would still have to tackle the legacy of heavy and rigid structures and rebuild their reputations, with a strong focus on consumer service and fairness.
At the same time, if a merger strategy is to work for the good of society, competition must be preserved.
If incumbents simply continue to get larger, blocking new competitors from entering the market, they will end up facing intrusive regulatory compliance programs and higher capital requirements.
New market entrants would have more flexibility and thus might be able to offer new, more appealing deals to customers.
This is why bank supervision and competition policy must work in tandem to ensure a level playing field.
On one hand, regulations must apply to all firms performing banking functions, including new fintech institutions.
On the other hand, implicit subsidies to too-big-to-fail banks must be dropped.
Bank mergers hold much promise, particularly in Europe.
To realize their potential will require the right policy mix, focused on consumer protection and fair competition.
Europe’s banks and banking authorities will need to step up their game.

Greening the New Industrial Revolution
VIENNA – Manufacturing industries present society with a dilemma. A healthy manufacturing sector helps an economy to grow, thereby raising living standards – an especially important goal for developing countries.
But, as factories try to meet ever-growing consumer demand, they deplete the world’s natural resources and pollute the environment.
For some, the world now faces a stark choice between rising prosperity and a cleaner, more sustainable environment.
In fact, with new technology and fresh thinking, policymakers can strike a durable balance between these competing interests.
In developed countries, consumers are increasingly recognizing that, while their material well-being may be higher than ever, their quality of life suffers if the environment is damaged.
For poorer countries, such concerns are dismissed as a rich-world luxury. Industrial expansion is the best way to eradicate poverty, and must surely trump environmental concerns.
No government, rich or poor, can ignore the imperative to encourage economic growth.
The manufacturing sector creates jobs, makes affordable products for cash-strapped consumers, produces vital tax revenue that can be used to support social goals, and brings in foreign currency in the form of export revenue.
In short, a well-run manufacturing sector spreads wealth across society.
However, trying to satisfy the seemingly endless material demands of consumers at all levels of the economic pyramid has placed an unmanageable burden on the natural world.
Resources are being consumed more quickly than the planet can replace them.
The manufacturing sector is particularly voracious, devouring over half of all raw materials, around 30% of the world’s energy, and 20% of its water.
In the process, it produces too much waste for our fragile ecosystems to absorb.
Now, public opinion is starting to turn against what is increasingly perceived as plunder on a global scale.
Policymakers may not be able to compel citizens to ration their consumption. But governments can encourage manufacturers to change how they operate, so that they use fewer resources and eliminate unnecessary waste.
Technological innovation and recyclable inputs can make a huge difference to the way the world produces and consumes.
Like the dramatic changes once wrought by mass production, there is similar potential in the development and application of 3D printing, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and other resource-efficient technologies.
And management thinkers from the late C. K. Prahalad to Jaideep Prabhu have shown how industry can be reconfigured to produce high-quality products cheaply and cleanly.
Indeed, these technologies and management ideas amount to something of a new industrial revolution – though one that will be very different from the Industrial Revolution that made Great Britain the dominant world power in the nineteenth century and helped it build a global empire.
The current transformation will be more democratic, spreading through global supply chains and modern communications to all countries that are integrated into the global economy.
And it will be characterized by partnerships between government, the private sector, and civil society.
Our challenge, and our historic opportunity, is to recognize this potential and find ways for diverse groups to collaborate and realize it.
A Green Industry Conference held recently in Guangzhou, China – following similar events in Manila in 2009 and Tokyo in 2011 – provides a template for this kind of broad cooperation.
Delegates shared best practices, discussed ways to accelerate change in a range of sectors, and sought innovative solutions to old management problems.
No one need be left out of this revolution.
Even countries with abundant natural resources do not have to fear the shift to a greener world.
By adopting new economic models, their large but finite reserves will not be rendered useless; they will simply last longer.
At the same time, countries facing shortages will gain greatly from being able to reduce their own resource needs.
Businesses, too, have been quick to adopt new practices.
Many now routinely monitor and report on their environmental impact.
Some are even starting to organize around new industrial concepts such as the “circular economy,” which focuses on reducing waste through multiple rounds of recycling.
This revolution may have been borne out of necessity; but, with ingenuity and cooperation, it will prove to be profitable, over the long run, for countries, manufacturers, and consumers worldwide.

Ensuring Africa’s Continued Rise
LAGOS – Africa’s rise is in danger of faltering.
After years during which the continent’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 5%, global uncertainty, depressed commodity prices, and jittery external conditions are threatening to undermine decades of much-needed progress.
Ensuring the wealth and wellbeing of the continent’s residents will not be easy; but there is much that policymakers can do to put Africa back on an upward trajectory.
First and foremost, policymakers must secure the financing needed to pursue sustainable development in an uncertain global environment.
The World Bank estimates that Africa will require at least $93 billion a year to fund its infrastructure needs alone.
Climate-friendly, sustainable infrastructure will cost even more.
And yet, as long as global growth remains weak, Africans cannot count on developed countries to fully honor their commitments to help attain the Sustainable Development Goals.
Africa must rapidly develop its own resources, beginning by nearly doubling tax revenues.
Across Sub-Saharan Africa, tax revenues account for less than one-fifth of GDP, compared to more than one-third in OECD countries.
This means there is plenty of room for improvement.
From 1990 to 2004, for example, Ghana reformed its tax system and raised revenues from 11% to 22% of GDP.
Admittedly, such progress is difficult; in Nigeria, we saw an opportunity in raising non-oil tax revenues, but struggled to seize it.
Another source of domestic resources is the roughly $380 billion in pension assets held by just ten African countries.
Policymakers should be leveraging these considerable sums.
At the same time, African countries will have to find a way to diversify their economies.
Diversification requires investment in the future, in the form of education and well-developed infrastructure, including telecommunications, power, roads, rail, and water.
There are plenty of models to follow: Dubai, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and South Korea are all admired by Africans as economies that managed to transform themselves.
Dubai, for example, set out more than three decades ago to prepare for a future without oil.
The government implemented a step-by-step transformation of the country into a service economy, putting in place the infrastructure and incentives necessary to build up financial services, tourism, medical services, real estate, media, arts, and culture.
South Korea and Singapore, which had few natural resources on which to rely, are no less inspiring.
The secret behind these countries’ success is relentlessly focused leaders, whether entrenched but benign dictators or democratically elected politicians with a shared vision of a broad-based economy.
Sub-Saharan Africa has paths for diversified growth that many of the trailblazers did not: value-added agriculture and agro industry, the processing of mineral resources, petrochemical complexes, manufacturing of durable and consumer goods, tourism and entertainment, and an emerging information-technology sector.
As the necessary measures for diversification are implemented, policymakers must ensure that the economic growth they are pursuing creates jobs.
Sadly, this has not always been the case.
Much of the recent growth has benefited only a few, leaving many behind – most notably young people and women.
From 2006 to 2013, inequality rose in many of the continent’s most important economies, including South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Rwanda.
These were challenges that we were starting to address in Nigeria when I was finance minister.
We knew that we needed not just to secure growth, but also to improve the quality of that growth.
To that end, policymakers must ensure that growth is channeled into sectors that create jobs, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
They may also have to redistribute income and strengthen social safety nets to protect better those at the bottom of the ladder.
Matching skills to job opportunities will be crucial.
Some 70% of Africa’s population is under 30, and the continent is home to half the world’s primary-school-age children who have been deprived of the opportunity to study.
Offering Africa’s children basic reading, writing, and technology skills, as well as vocational, technical, and entrepreneurial training, must be a top priority.
Weak health-care systems must also be strengthened in order to tackle the endemic diseases that sap productivity, such as malaria, as well as improving preparedness for outbreaks of deadly epidemics.
The stakes are high.
The World Bank estimates the Ebola outbreak shrank the economies of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia by 16%.
As the world economy sputters, African countries will have to develop trade with one another.
In 2013, African goods and services accounted for just 16% of trade within the continent, and just over 3% of world trade.
One problem is that most African countries produce the same type of commodities and trade them with very little value-added.
Policymakers must encourage greater specialization; differentiated goods and services will add value and volume to trade.
Logistics pose another obstacle to intra-African trade.
Policymakers must make it easier to move goods across borders, by improving connectivity between countries and reducing bureaucratic hurdles and administrative costs.
For example, road transport tariffs across Africa are estimated at $0.05-$0.13 per ton-kilometer, compared to the average of $0.01-$0.05 for all developing countries.
The Rift Valley Railway project, which will eventually link Mombasa on the Kenyan coast to Kampala in Uganda, is a good example of the benefits that investments in transportation could provide.
The African Development Bank estimates that it will double the volume of trade between the two countries, while reducing marginal costs by 30%.
As they make these investments, policymakers must not forget that much of Africa’s recent growth can be credited to good macroeconomic policies and sound economic management.
Extending the continent’s rise will require strengthening the continent’s economic fundamentals.
This means ensuring that prices in the economy are correct, starting with the exchange rate.
Some countries may need temporary controls to curb damaging capital outflows, but policymakers should aim for a market-based exchange rate and a solid plan for governing inflation, debt, foreign-exchange reserves, current accounts, and fiscal balances.
Africa’s potential can hardly be overstated.
The continent is well placed to build diversified economies based on low-carbon, sustainable infrastructure.
But policymakers cannot simply assume that Africa’s rise will continue.
They must take the right steps to ensure that it does.

More or Less Europe?
WASHINGTON, DC – On May 23-26, voters across the European Union will go to the polls to elect members of the European Parliament.
Much will be at stake.
“Never, since World War II, has Europe been as essential,” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote recently, “yet never has Europe been in so much danger.”
Forces challenging the foundations of the European project are on the rise: Brexit supporters in the United Kingdom, populist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, and far-right parties in or near power virtually everywhere.
Yet supporters of further European integration have been buoyed by the bold pronouncements of Macron, France’s most pro-European president in decades.
The upcoming elections will entrench the growing divide between those who want less Europe and those who want more.
And the fragmented parliament that is likely to emerge will cast further uncertainty on the EU’s future direction.
More generally, European politics seems ripe for a fundamental restructuring, with the long-standing division between center-left and center-right parties replaced by differences over the extent of further EU integration.
Those in favor of deeper integration also generally view globalization positively.
True, they may not like the large inequalities and winner-take-all markets that globalization has brought.
But they recognize the potential benefits of open markets and an open global economy, provided there is adequate regulation.
And they believe that a more integrated Europe would have the necessary weight to make such regulation feasible.
Nationalists opposed to further EU integration, by contrast, also often resist globalization.
They advocate returning to a more loosely integrated Europe of sovereign nation-states, and rolling back the activities and reach of European institutions.
Some want no EU at all.
Yet although the divide between neo-nationalists and “Europeans” is probably the dominant fault line in these elections, the reality is more complicated.
On the far right, for example, protectionists dominate, but there are also free traders who combine laissez-faire economics with virulent anti-immigrant sentiment.
Opinion polls suggest that anti-European and right-wing populist groups will together win about one-third of the parliament’s 751 seats.
The center-right European People’s Party (EPP) and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) could remain the two largest single blocs, but they will probably lose their current combined majority.
The centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) is likely to be the smallest bloc.
But if, as seems likely, Macron’s La République En Marche! decides to join it, ALDE could form an important group, with more than 13% of the seats.
The Greens from various countries (above all Germany) will occupy the center and part of the left, together with the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
Such an outcome will make it very hard to form stable alliances, and may complicate the process of electing the next president of the European Commission.
The EPP, S&D, and ALDE will probably barely have a majority between them, and may not always vote together in any case.
Further eurozone integration should be the new parliament’s top priority.
With Macron’s support, ALDE will probably take the lead in pushing for a eurozone budget and finance minister, and greater fiscal-policy coordination.
The S&D would probably be ready to support some form of such integration, provided it has a strong social dimension – perhaps even eurozone unemployment insurance.
But the EPP will be much harder to convince, and may oppose more integration, joining the rightist Euroskeptic parties.
Even if further eurozone integration is placed on the backburner for now, it is essential to the European project.
The EU’s economic recovery is faltering, and a one-size-fits-all monetary policy cannot, and should not, be made to carry the entire burden of macroeconomic policy.
The irrevocably fixed exchange rates created by the eurozone do not allow for national monetary policies, while significant fiscal-policy divergence would invite a crisis of the kind already experienced in the EU’s southern member states.
One must hope, therefore, that Macron revives the integration proposals he advanced at the start of his presidency and manages to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EPP to support him.
Perhaps Merkel, who will not seek another term and may be thinking about her political legacy, will finally want to allow the eurozone to move forward.
Migration policy will be another challenge, because Euroskeptics will be joined by the East Europeans.
The centrist parties will therefore have great difficulties finding and maintaining majorities, especially in view of the EPP’s suspension of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party in March.
But for all of Europe’s problems and political fragmentation, the upcoming elections reflect the success of the European project: 28 countries (assuming the UK takes part) engaging in a cross-border election with pan-European parties, and already sharing a great deal of sovereignty.
And, according to a European Commission Eurobarometer survey, 55% of European citizens believe that more decisions should be taken at the EU level.
In that respect, this month’s European elections are hugely encouraging.
In a world threatened by the ghosts of extreme nationalism, they are a unique manifestation of the will to build a common future.

Complacency Will Be Tested in 2018
NEW HAVEN – After years of post-crisis despair, the broad consensus of forecasters is now quite upbeat about prospects for the global economy in 2018.
World GDP growth is viewed as increasingly strong, synchronous, and inflation-free.
Exuberant financial markets could hardly ask for more.
While I have great respect for the forecasting community and the collective wisdom of financial markets, I suspect that today’s consensus of complacency will be seriously tested in 2018.
The test might come from a shock – especially in view of the rising risk of a hot war (with North Korea) or a trade war (between the US and China) or a collapsing asset bubble (think Bitcoin).
But I have a hunch it will turn out to be something far more systemic.
The world is set up for the unwinding of three mega-trends: unconventional monetary policy, the real economy’s dependence on assets, and a potentially destabilizing global saving arbitrage.
At risk are the very fundamentals that underpin current optimism.
One or more of these pillars of complacency will, I suspect, crumble in 2018.
Unfortunately, the die has long been cast for this moment of reckoning.
Afflicted by a profound sense of amnesia, central banks have repeated the same mistake they made in the pre-crisis froth of 2003-2007 – over staying excessively accommodative monetary policies.
Misguided by inflation targeting in an inflationless world, monetary authorities have deferred policy normalization for far too long.
That now appears to be changing, but only grudgingly.
If anything, central bankers are signaling that the coming normalization may even be more glacial than that of the mid-2000s.
After all, with inflation still undershooting, goes the argument, what’s the rush?
Alas, there is an important twist today that wasn’t in play back then –central banks’ swollen balance sheets.
From 2008 to 2017, the combined asset holdings of central banks in the major advanced economies (the United States, the eurozone, and Japan) expanded by $8.3 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
With nominal GDP in these same economies increasing by just $2.1 trillion over the same period, the remaining $6.2 trillion of excess liquidity has distorted asset prices around the world.
Therein lies the crux of the problem.
Real economies have been artificially propped up by these distorted asset prices, and glacial normalization will only prolong this dependency.
Yet when central banks’ balance sheets finally start to shrink, asset-dependent economies will once again be in peril.
And the risks are likely to be far more serious today than a decade ago, owing not only to the overhang of swollen central bank balance sheets, but also to the overvaluation of assets.
That is particularly true in the United States.
According to Nobel laureate economist Robert J. Shiller, the cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio of 31.3 is currently about 15% higher than it was in mid-2007, on the brink of the subprime crisis.
In fact, the CAPE ratio has been higher than it is today only twice in its 135-plus year history – in 1929 and in 2000.
Those are not comforting precedents.
As was evident in both 2000 and 2008, it doesn’t take much for overvalued asset markets to fall sharply.
That’s where the third mega-trend could come into play – a wrenching adjustment in the global saving mix.
In this case, it’s all about China and the US – the polar extremes of the world’s saving distribution.
China is now in a mode of saving absorption; its domestic saving rate has declined from a peak of 52% in 2010 to 46% in 2016, and appears headed to 42%, or lower, over the next five years.
Chinese surplus saving is increasingly being directed inward to support emerging middle-class consumers – making less available to fund needy deficit savers elsewhere in the world.
By contrast, the US, the world’s neediest deficit country, with a domestic saving rate of just 17%, is opting for a fiscal stimulus.
That will push total national saving even lower – notwithstanding the vacuous self-funding assurances of supply-siders.
As shock absorbers, overvalued financial markets are likely to be squeezed by the arbitrage between the world’s largest surplus and deficit savers.
And asset-dependent real economies won’t be too far behind.
In this context, it’s important to stress that the world economy may not be nearly as resilient as the consensus seems to believe – raising questions about whether it can withstand the challenges coming in 2018.
IMF forecasts are typically a good proxy for the global consensus.
The latest IMF projection looks encouraging on the surface – anticipating 3.7% global GDP growth over the 2017-18 period, an acceleration of 0.4 percentage points from the anemic 3.3% pace of the past two years.
However, it is a stretch to call this a vigorous global growth outcome.
Not only is it little different from the post-1965 trend of 3.8% growth, but the expected gains over 2017-2018 follow an exceptionally weak recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
This takes on added significance for a global economy that slowed to just 1.4% average growth in 2008-2009 – an unprecedented shortfall from its longer-term trend.
The absence of a classic vigorous rebound means the global economy never recouped the growth lost in the worst downturn of modern times.
Historically, such V-shaped recoveries have served the useful purpose of absorbing excess slack and providing a cushion to withstand the inevitable shocks that always seem to buffet the global economy.
The absence of such a cushion highlights lingering vulnerability, rather than signaling newfound resilience – not exactly the rosy scenario embraced by today’s smug consensus.
A quote often attributed to the Nobel laureate physicist Niels Bohr says it best: “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.”
The outlook for 2018 is far from certain.
But with tectonic shifts looming in the global macroeconomic landscape, this is no time for complacency.

Where Do Good Jobs Come From?
CAMBRIDGE – Around the world this May Day, policy proposals that would have appeared radical just a few years ago are now on the agenda.
In the United States, for example, high marginal tax rates, wealth taxes, and single-payer health care have become mainstream ideas.
Yet unless policymakers get their priorities right, the opportunity for meaningful reform could be squandered, leading to even deeper social and political divisions.
In fact, while the reforms that are needed are radical and sweeping, they are not the ones currently in vogue.
The top priority should be creating high-wage jobs, and this goal should guide policymakers’ approach to everything from technology, regulation, and taxes to education and social programs.
Historically, no known human society has created shared prosperity purely through redistribution.
Prosperity comes from creating jobs that pay decent wages.
And it is good jobs, not redistribution, that provide people with purpose and meaning in life.
Creating such jobs requires that technological innovation be directed toward boosting demand for workers.
Good jobs do not emerge naturally from free markets.
Rather, they require labor-market institutions that protect and empower workers, generously funded education systems, and effective social safety nets.
This is the institutional architecture that furnished the US and other advanced economies with four decades of strong, inclusive growth after World War II.
The massive growth in labor demand during that era rested on three pillars.
First, businesses deployed technology in ways that increased labor productivity, thus fueling wage growth and demand for workers.
At the same time, governments provided crucial support, by funding education and research, and (in some cases) becoming major purchasers of high-tech equipment.
Most of today’s defining technologies owe something to government-funded innovation from this period.
Second, governments during the postwar era shaped the business environment with minimum wages, workplace-safety regulations, and other labor- and product-market regulations.
Such measures are often blamed for choking off employment.
But they can actually create a virtuous cycle of growth, because the cost floor for labor creates an incentive for firms to rationalize and upgrade their production processes, thereby increasing productivity and thus demand.
Similarly, by ensuring that product markets remain competitive, governments can prevent firms from charging monopoly prices and reaping higher profits without having to hire more workers.
Third, governments in the post-war era expanded access to education, which meant that more workers had the skills that were in demand.
In the US, for example, the federal government made higher education and vocational training available to millions of citizens with the G.I. Bill, Pell Grants, support for research, and other measures.
Yes, all of this investment in innovation and education required higher tax revenues.
But moderately higher tax rates and economic growth itself were sufficient to make up the difference.
A similar institutional architecture took hold across much of the industrialized world during the postwar era.
For example, in Scandinavia, shared prosperity was achieved not through redistribution, as is commonly assumed, but as a result of government policies and collective bargaining, which created an environment conducive to the creation of high-wage jobs.
This is not to suggest that the 1950s and 1960s were perfect.
In the US, discrimination against African-Americans and women remained deeply ingrained, and educational opportunities were not equally distributed.
Still, in many other ways, economic conditions then were better than they are now, particularly when it comes to the availability of high-wage jobs.
Having averaged about 2.5% per year between 1947 and 1987, private-sector wage growth in the US decelerated sharply after 1987, and ceased altogether after 2000 – a full seven years before the Great Recession.
This stall has coincided with a period of weak productivity growth and a reorientation of investment toward automation, and away from the creation of new, higher-productivity tasks for humans.
As a result, high-wage jobs have dried up, wages have stopped growing, and a larger share of prime-age adults have dropped out of the labor force.
More broadly, the institutional architecture that once underpinned job creation crumbled during this period.
Protections for workers were steadily weakened, market concentration in many sectors increased, and the government abandoned its previous support for innovation. By 2015, federally funded research and development had fallen to 0.7% of GDP, down from 1.9% in the 1960s.
Many regard the falloff in the creation of high-wage jobs as the inevitable result of advances in artificial intelligence and robotics.
It isn’t.
Technology can be used either to displace labor or to enhance worker productivity.
The choice is ours.
But to ensure that such decisions benefit workers, governments need to coax the private sector away from its singular focus on automation.
In the US, this might start with fixing tax policy, which is far too favorable toward capital income.
Because firms can reduce their tax burden by deploying machines, they often have an incentive to pursue automation, even in cases where hired workers would actually be more productive.
Government also needs to get back into the business of supporting technological innovation, in order to provide a counterweight to the big tech firms, whose business models are overwhelmingly geared toward automation at the expense of job creation.
And, of course, expanding educational opportunities across the board is essential.
As in the postwar era, this institutional architecture will require higher tax revenues, especially in the US, where annual tax revenue relative to GDP is around 27%, well below the OECD average (34%).
In raising that figure, the point should not be to punish the rich, but to remove distortions such as the favorable treatment of capital.
That means broadening the tax base and increasing tax rates modestly (to avoid discouraging investment and innovation).
A society powered by shared prosperity is not out of reach.
But getting there will require urgent action to align technology with workers’ needs, prevent monopolization, and fix the tax code so that we can fund the investments we need.
Restoring the post-war institutional architecture will be a job for humans only.

Three Global Health Threats
SAN FRANCISCO – The tragic Ebola outbreak in West Africa has underscored the imperative of strengthening health systems at both the national and global level.
But, though Ebola has focused the world’s attention on systemic shortcomings, the goal must be to combat the abiding epidemics that are quietly inflicting suffering and death on populations worldwide.
Ebola has undoubtedly wrought tremendous agony. But it is not the first – or the most devastating – pandemic the world has faced.
In fact, smallpox is the deadliest disease known to humanity; until Edward Jenner developed the vaccine in 1796, it was the leading cause of death in Europe. Before its eradication in 1980, it killed an estimated 300-500 million people.
The Bubonic plague of the fourteenth century killed 75-100 million people – more than half of Europe’s population.
Nearly 75 million people, or 3-5% of the world’s population, died in just a few months during the 1918 influenza pandemic – more than twice the number of people killed in World War I.
The world continues to grapple with HIV/AIDS, which has already caused more than 40 million deaths and infects a similar number of people today, with 95% of the epidemic’s victims living in developing countries.
Only when HIV/AIDS began to gain traction in advanced countries were highly effective anti-retroviral therapies developed – therapy that most of the poor people suffering from the disease could not access or afford.
Similarly, the failure of governments, multilateral organizations, and NGOs to respond quickly enough to the Ebola outbreak reflects the fact that the disease has ravaged poor countries.
But, at a time of unprecedented global interconnectedness, everyone has a stake in ensuring that adequate health-care systems and structures are in place to address such a pandemic.
Achieving this requires providing the needed investment; after all, effective national health systems and agile surveillance are the first lines of defense against outbreaks of disease.
At this point, Ebola is not only a health crisis, but also a humanitarian, economic, and political crisis.
To be sure, some progress has been made.
The United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response’s “70/70/60” plan – to isolate 70% of Ebola patients and ensure that 70% of burials are conducted safely within 60 days – has largely been implemented, reducing the number of new cases considerably.
But people are still suffering and dying – often owing to a lack of access to credible information or adequate treatment.
Of course, when it comes to safeguarding the health of populations, there is a fine line between protecting the public and impinging on individual rights.
That is why all public-health interventions must focus first and foremost on scientific facts, and avoid emotional or panicked responses.
In this context, the imposition of mandatory quarantines on travelers from Ebola-affected countries was an obvious policy failure – just as they were when authorities tried to contain the Black Death of 1350 in Europe or the Plague of London in 1665.
Instead of wasting time on fear-based strategies, the international community must leverage human and financial resources to ensure fact-based, concerted, collective action.
Such a united approach is possible; indeed, it has happened before.
At the turn of the century, the establishment of institutions like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, coincided with a renewed effort to improve global health.
The UN’s commitment to the Millennium Development Goals – which included four health-related targets, covering nutrition, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases – reflected a political consensus to improve health worldwide.
This institutional architecture has facilitated considerable progress in many of these areas; for example, the under-five mortality rate has plummeted by 49% since 1990.
But there is far more to be done.
In regions like Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal and child health and infectious diseases remain priorities.
In fact, the ten countries with the highest child mortality rates are all located in Sub-Saharan Africa; a baby born in West Africa is 30 times likelier to die before the age of five than one born in Western Europe.
Even within countries, massive inequalities remain.
For example, there is a ten-fold difference in infant mortality between municipalities in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Nuevo León.
Moreover, silent epidemics have taken hold, particularly in lower-income countries, as the combination of mega-trends like urbanization, population aging, obesity, sedentary lifestyles, smoking, and alcohol consumption has spurred the rise of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
For adults in most countries, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have become leading causes of disability and death.
Emerging infectious diseases like Ebola may be more compelling, but the health impact of chronic NCDs, not to mention their high and growing social and economic costs, is substantially larger.
There is no time to waste.
Policymakers must pursue aggressive action to curb the spread of risk factors like the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and obesogenic foods.
The world is facing a three-prong health challenge: We must build sustainable national and global health systems that can respond quickly and effectively to crises like Ebola; eliminate or control infectious diseases; and address the quietly rising epidemic of chronic NCDs.
To succeed on all three fronts, we need sustained investment in health infrastructure, management, and personnel.
Equality is key.
This means improving access to health care and education. But it also means addressing the deeper social inequities that extend beyond the public-health agenda.
In formulating the post-2015 development goals, world leaders must remember that health is a fundamental human right.

In Defense of Global Public Goods
MADRID – Last month’s NATO summit in Madrid was a resounding success, demonstrating the West’s enduring resolve to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin over his war on Ukraine.
But the value of Western unity against Putin will be diminished in a world that is becoming increasingly divided, as the recent meetings of G20 finance and foreign ministers in Indonesia showed.
This trend could carry incalculably high costs, because a highly polarized world cannot meet the most important task of our century: ensuring the provision of global public goods.
Such goods – including a clean environment, international security, and global health – cannot be provided without effective global institutions.
One might expect a crisis, with major global consequences, to spur cooperation, as was the case with the G20’s emergence after the 2008 global financial crisis.
But, while crises may have a unifying effect, the Ukraine war is stalling efforts to manage its global consequences.
Globalization has brought great advances for humanity. But it has also brought new risks and challenges, which can be managed only through effective multilateral institutions.
As former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott observed in 2001, not long after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, “Globalization is like gravity.
It’s not a policy; it’s not a program.
It’s not good; it’s not evil.
It’s happening.”
But, as the last decade has shown, even if globalization is an inescapable historical phenomenon, geopolitical rivalries can fracture and fragment the institutions on which it depends, making it impossible to mount effective responses to shared challenges like climate change.
Pursuing the global agenda is incompatible with a fragmented global economy.
Already, an economic decoupling is underway. As a result, it has heightened the most important systemic risk the world faces: the shift to “two globalizations,” one organized around the US, and the other around China.
If this decoupling is completed, the multilateral institutions that were created to manage globalization will become obsolete.
But the economy is just the beginning.
The war in Ukraine is bolstering the narrative that an inescapable ideological struggle between democracies and autocracies has taken hold.
If this perception prevails, the world will inevitably split into geopolitical blocs.
This would be a tragedy for the countries of the Global South, in particular.
These countries would face a fateful choice between two mutually exclusive geopolitical blocs.
But regardless of which bloc they chose, global problems would still prove to be unmanageable – let alone solvable – without the other bloc.
After decades of seeking to assert their sovereignty above all, developing countries are finding that the biggest threats they face – from pandemics to food insecurity – are unaffected by their geopolitical affinities.
It is worth noting, however, that those affinities are not, by and large, to the democratic bloc.
Most of the world looks with indifference – and often suspicion – at the West’s robust measures to isolate Putin.
For example, as Europe works to reduce its dependence on Russian energy, India is exponentially increasing its purchases of Russian oil at discount prices.
Unlike the West, the Global South does not view the Ukraine war in existential terms.
Instead, the conflict represents, above all, increased food shortages and higher energy prices. The political crisis in Sri Lanka, for example, cannot be interpreted solely through the prism of domestic developments.
Interdependence remains a central and powerful feature of the international order.
In a culturally and politically diverse world, democratic exclusiveness is not the most effective way to build bridges – especially with those whose immediate material needs are not being met.
In this sense, Western countries are doing themselves no favors by giving the impression that the fora in which they convene are, essentially, “democracy summits.”
A better approach would recognize that the most consequential global division today is not between democracies and autocracies, but between rich and poor countries.
The COVID-19 pandemic threw this division into sharp relief.
In September 2021, just over 3% of people in low-income countries had received at least one vaccine dose, compared to more than 60% in high-income countries.
Though the worst of the pandemic is over, the Global South’s resentment toward the vaccine-hoarding North remains. If the North fails to convey a greater sense of urgency to strengthen the provision of global public goods, that resentment will only grow.
Of course, tensions with Russia will complicate the main multilateral organizations’ efforts to reach agreements on shared challenges.
But they do not preclude cooperation. That much was clear at last month’s ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, where several valuable agreements were reached.
For example, eligible countries can now override patents for the production and supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
It is useful to remind ourselves of the reason and purpose underpinning sanctions on Russia.
The West did not impose sanctions against Putin’s regime merely because it does not meet a particular democratic standard.
The measures are a response to Putin’s decision to violate the principle – fundamental to international law – that the borders of an independent and sovereign state cannot be changed by force.
For most of my life, relations between the West and Russia have been defined by mutual suspicion – and sometimes, such as now, open enmity.
This will not change for a long time.
We must stand up to Putin.
But we must also extend our hand to the Global South, by making all efforts to preserve the institutions that are so essential to protect the public goods on which all of us depend.

In Defense of Economic Populism
CAMBRIDGE – Populists abhor restraints on the political executive.
Since they claim to represent “the people” writ large, they regard limits on their exercise of power as necessarily undermining the popular will. Such constraints can only serve the “enemies of the people” – minorities and foreigners (for right-wing populists) or financial elites (in the case of left-wing populists).
This is a dangerous approach to politics, because it allows a majority to ride roughshod over the rights of minorities.
Without separation of powers, an independent judiciary, or free media – which all populist autocrats, from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump detest – democracy degenerates into the tyranny of whoever happens to be in power.
Periodic elections under populist rule become a smokescreen.
In the absence of the rule of law and basic civil liberties, populist regimes can prolong their rule by manipulating the media and the judiciary at will.
Populists’ aversion to institutional restraints extends to the economy, where exercising full control “in the people’s interest” implies that no obstacles should be placed in their way by autonomous regulatory agencies, independent central banks, or global trade rules.
But while populism in the political domain is almost always harmful, economic populism can sometimes be justified.
Start with why restraints on economic policy may be desirable in the first place. Economists tend to have a soft spot for such restraints, because policymaking that is fully responsive to the push and pull of domestic politics can generate highly inefficient outcomes.
In particular, economic policy is often subject to the problem of what economists call time-inconsistency: short-term interests frequently undermine the pursuit of policies that are far more desirable in the long term.
A canonical example is discretionary monetary policy.
Politicians who have the power to print money at will may generate “surprise inflation” to boost output and employment in the short run – say, before an election.
But this backfires, because firms and households adjust their inflation expectations. In the end, discretionary monetary policy results only in higher inflation without yielding any output or employment gains.
The solution is an independent central bank, insulated from politics, operating solely on its mandate to maintain price stability.
The costs of macroeconomic populism are familiar from Latin America.
As Jeffrey D. Sachs, Sebastián Edwards, and Rüdiger Dornbusch argued years ago, unsustainable monetary and fiscal policies were the bane of the region until economic orthodoxy began to prevail in the 1990s.
Populist policies periodically produced painful economic crises, which hurt the poor the most. To break this cycle, the region turned to fiscal rules and technocratic finance ministers.
Another example is official treatment of foreign investors.
Once a foreign firm makes its investment, it essentially becomes captive to the host government’s whims. Promises that were made to attract the firm are easily forgotten, replaced by policies that squeeze it to the benefit of the national budget or domestic companies.
But investors are not stupid, and, fearing this outcome, they invest elsewhere.
Governments’ need to establish their credibility has thus given rise to trade agreements with so-called investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses, allowing the firm to sue the government in international tribunals.
These are examples of restraints on economic policy that take the form of delegation to autonomous agencies, technocrats, or external rules.
As described, they serve the valuable function of preventing those in power from shooting themselves in the foot by pursuing short-sighted policies.
But there are other scenarios as well, in which the consequences of restraints on economic policy may be less salutary.
In particular, restraints may be instituted by special interests or elites themselves, to cement permanent control over policymaking.
In such cases, delegation to autonomous agencies or signing on to global rules does not serve society, but only a narrow caste of “insiders.”
Part of today’s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades.
Multinational corporations and investors have increasingly shaped the agenda of international trade negotiations, resulting in global regimes that disproportionately benefit capital at the expense of labor.
Stringent patent rules and international investor tribunals are prime examples.
So is the capture of autonomous agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate.
Banks and other financial institutions have been especially successful at getting their way and instituting rules that give them free rein.
Independent central banks played a critical role in bringing inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s. But in the current low-inflation environment, their exclusive focus on price stability imparts a deflationary bias to economic policy and is in tension with employment generation and growth.
Such “liberal technocracy” may be at its apogee in the European Union, where economic rules and regulations are designed at considerable remove from democratic deliberation at the national level.
And in virtually every member state, this political gap – the EU’s so-called democratic deficit – has given rise to populist, Euroskeptical political parties.
In such cases, relaxing the constraints on economic policy and returning policymaking autonomy to elected governments may well be desirable.
Exceptional times require the freedom to experiment in economic policy.
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal provides an apt historical example.
FDR’s reforms required that he remove the economic shackles imposed by conservative judges and financial interests at home and by the gold standard abroad.
We should constantly be wary of populism that stifles political pluralism and undermines liberal democratic norms.
Political populism is a menace to be avoided at all costs.
Economic populism, by contrast, is occasionally necessary. Indeed, at such times, it may be the only way to forestall its much more dangerous political cousin.

The Coming French Revolution
PARIS – In a few weeks, France will elect its next president.
Given the French executive’s considerable powers, including the authority to dissolve the National Assembly, the presidential election, held every five years, is France’s most important.
But the stakes are higher than ever this time.
The two frontrunners are the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under Socialist President François Hollande, but is running as an independent.
If, as expected, Le Pen and Macron face off in the election’s second round on May 7, it will be a political watershed for France: the first time in 60 years that the main parties of the left and the right are not represented in the second round.
France has not endured such political turmoil since 1958, when, in the midst of the Algerian War, General Charles de Gaulle came to power and crafted the Constitution of the Fifth Republic.
That shift, like any great political rupture, was driven by a combination of deep underlying dynamics and the particular circumstances of the moment.
Today is no different.
First, the underlying dynamic: the rise, as in most developed countries nowadays, of popular mistrust of elites, feelings of disempowerment, fear of economic globalization and immigration, and anxiety over downward social mobility and growing inequality.
These sentiments – together with the French state’s historical role in fostering national identity and economic growth – have contributed to a surge in support for the National Front.
Le Pen’s nationalist, xenophobic message and populist economic policies resemble those of the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
Although support for the National Front has been growing for more than a decade, the party has so far been kept out of power by France’s two-round electoral system, which enables voters to unite against it in the second round.
And, given the National Front’s inability to make alliances, power has remained in the hands of the main parties of the left and the right, even as France has moved toward a tripartite political system.
Now, Macron is taking advantage of current circumstances to blow up the tripartite system.
Macron’s great insight, which few initially recognized, was that the right-left divide was blocking progress, and that the presidential election amounted to a golden opportunity to move beyond it, without the help of an organized political movement.
At a time when the French people are increasingly rejecting the traditional party system, Macron’s initial weakness quickly became his strength.
It helped that, as Macron himself recognized, both the right and the left have fragmented in recent years. This is particularly true on the left, where a clear division has emerged between a reformist current, led by former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and traditionalists, represented by the Socialist Party candidate, Benoît Hamon.
The Socialists’ problems are compounded by the existence of a radical left working actively to eliminate them, much as Spain’s left-wing Podemos party has sought to replace the Socialist Workers’ Party there.
The source of the mainstream right’s travails is less clear.
Its forces remain generally united on economic and social issues.
In fact, until a few months ago, its presidential candidate, the Republicans’ François Fillon, was expected to lead the pack in the first round by a wide margin.
But a scandal over his personal conduct (he allegedly paid his wife and children for non-existent jobs while he was a member of parliament) damaged his candidacy – probably fatally.
Whatever the reason for the right’s decline, Macron has benefited substantially from it, as well as from the rifts afflicting the left.
Now, there is a real chance the young independent could be elected president on May 7, upending the Fifth Republic’s political system.
But an electoral victory is just a first step.
To govern in France’s hybrid presidential-parliamentary system, Macron would need to secure a majority in the National Assembly.
This opens the possibility of two scenarios.
In the first scenario, Macron quickly gains a parliamentary majority, as French voters seek to reinforce his mandate in June’s National Assembly election.
This is conceivable, but not certain: it is here where the lack of an organized political movement on the ground remains a weakness for Macron.
That is why the June election could give rise to the second scenario: cohabitation with a parliamentary coalition comprising a small right-wing faction, a large centrist faction, and a hopelessly divided left-wing faction.
Such a development would be familiar in many European countries.
But in France, where republicanism gave rise to the left-right ideological spectrum that shapes politics throughout the West today, it would be a genuine revolution – one that could spell the end of the Socialist Party.
Given the symbolic power of the left-right divide, France’s voters and political leaders alike have long tended to frame virtually all of the country’s problems in ideological terms.
The public and its politicians have little experience with government based on broad coalition agreements.
This partly explains why the political system becomes gridlocked, sometimes making reforms difficult to implement, and why Macron’s message, which includes clear reform plans, is so unusual for France.
If Le Pen somehow comes out on top, French politics – not to mention the European Union – will be turned upside.
But even the ostensibly moderate Macron represents, in his own way, a truly radical stance.
With both candidates likely to make it to the second round, France is on the verge of a political revolution, regardless of who wins.

Europe’s Two Futures
PARIS – Once again, Europe seems to have reached a fork in the road.
In one direction lies the future as described by pessimists, who argue that rising populist movements and the plunge of the euro are evidence of the continent’s coming slide into geopolitical and economic oblivion.
In the other direction lies a steep upward path to Europe’s integration and reemergence as a global power – the course, optimists say, that the continent will take as it wakes up and recognizes that it must have the capacity to weather the harshest storms.
There is no telling which future will be realized.
Is Europe “a grandmother, no longer fertile and vibrant,” as Pope Francis put it when he addressed the European Parliament last November?
Or is it a phoenix, about to rise (yet again) from its ashes?
The outcome depends, of course, on how Europeans respond to their current travails.
And as they contemplate their choices, they would be wise to consider how the continent is perceived from the outside.
For starters, it is important to acknowledge that the outlook looks bleak.
Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz, Jews are still being attacked and murdered in European cities.
More than 50 years after the end of the Algerian War, European Muslims face more discrimination than ever.
With Russian-backed separatists – and maybe even Russian troops – battling government forces in Ukraine, the specter of war is once again stalking the continent.
And the election of a leftist government in Greece has raised the question of whether introducing the euro was a good idea.
On the other hand, Europe has faced worse – much worse – and emerged stronger than ever.
After the first half of the twentieth century – the bloodiest period of human history – the continent’s leaders returned from the battlefield to lay the foundations of lasting European peace.
Europe may never regain its standing as the center of the world, but it can continue to be both an important actor and an attractive model for others.
Indeed, with the benefit of distance, a broader picture emerges.
Seen from China, Europe is first and foremost an attractive investment opportunity; and the euro’s spectacular fall now makes it a particularly tempting one.
The continent may not be the island of stability it once was – Russian President Vladimir Putin and a few thousand European jihadists have seen to that.
But the risks it faces are mild when compared with the chronic instability and acute threats facing much of the rest of the world.
Europe’s bloodstained history also provides a useful warning for China and the rest of Asia, and can serve as an example for overcoming the region’s long-standing animosities.
Though tensions between China and its neighbors over territorial claims in the East and South China Seas have receded somewhat in recent months, the prospect of worsening Sino-Japanese relations, in particular, remains worrisome.
Reconciliation along the Franco-German model may not yet be in the cards, but the two Asian powers would be well advised to learn from Europe’s experience.
The view from the United States is completely different.
From the American perspective, Europe is less a model than a historical relic.
The continent’s national characteristics have returned to the fore: Germany with its economic power, France with its terrorists, Greece with its leftists, and so forth.
From the perspective of the poorest parts of the world, Europe represents the weakest link in the coalition fighting radical Islam, a battle that is taking its highest toll – despite the impression created by Western media coverage – primarily in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa.
For many of those fleeing the conflicts in these regions, Europe is also the Promised Land – the object of the hopes and dreams of those risking their lives to reach the prosperous side of the Mediterranean Sea.
In the end, how Europeans view themselves will determine their collective fate.
If they do not seize this decisive moment to define themselves – by beginning to institute the difficult reforms their countries so desperately need, for example – they risk ending up on a path they never intended to take.

The Capitalist Threat to Capitalism
LONDON – Winston Churchill famously observed that democracy is the worst form of government – apart from all the others that have been tried.
Were he alive today, he might think the same of capitalism as a vehicle for economic and social progress.
Capitalism has guided the world economy to unprecedented prosperity.
Yet it has also proved dysfunctional in important ways.
It often encourages shortsightedness, contributes to wide disparities between the rich and the poor, and tolerates the reckless treatment of environmental capital.
If these costs cannot be controlled, support for capitalism may disappear – and with it, humanity’s best hope for economic growth and prosperity.
It is therefore time to consider new models for capitalism that are emerging around the world – specifically, conscious capitalism, moral capitalism, and inclusive capitalism.
Such efforts at redefining capitalism recognize that business must look beyond profit and loss to maintain public support for a market economy.
All of them share the assumption that companies must be mindful of their role in society and work to ensure that the benefits of growth are broadly shared and do not impose unacceptable environmental and social costs.
As it stands, despite recent emerging-market growth, the world economy is a place of staggering extremes.
The 1.2 billion poorest people on the planet account for just 1% of global consumption, while the billion richest are responsible for 72%.
According to a recent study, the 85 richest people in the world have accumulated the same wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion.
One in eight people go to bed hungry every night, while 1.4 billion adults are overweight.
Any system that generates such excesses and excludes so many faces a risk of public rejection.
Troublingly, capitalism’s negative side effects are intensifying while confidence in public institutions has fallen to an historic low.
According to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, less than half of the global population trusts government.
Business fares better but not much.
Scandals – from conspiracies to fix key financial rates to the discovery of horsemeat in the food supply – undermine people’s faith in business as an agent of the greater good.
Disillusioned with both state and market, people increasingly ask whether capitalism, as we practice it, is worth the costs.
We see this in movements such as Earth Day and Occupy Wall Street.
In many parts of the world – from the Arab Spring countries to Brazil, Turkey, Venezuela, and Ukraine, frustrated publics are taking to the streets.
Addressing the failures of modern capitalism will require strong leadership and extensive cooperation between businesses, governments, and NGOs.
To begin creating a path forward, we are convening key global leaders in London on May 27 for a conference on inclusive capitalism.
Top executives from institutions representing more than $30 trillion in investable assets – one-third of the world’s total – will be in attendance.
Their aim will be to establish tangible steps that firms can take to begin changing the way business is done – and rebuilding public confidence in capitalism.
Such an effort can bear fruit, as Unilever’s own actions demonstrate.
Since abandoning guidance and quarterly profit reporting, the company has worked hard to prioritize long-term thinking.
It has adopted plans to boost the company’s growth while reducing its environmental footprint and increasing its positive societal impact.
Many of its brands now have social missions – for example, Dove products are marketed with an accompanying women’s self-esteem campaign, and Lifebuoy soap targets communicable diseases through its global hand-washing programs.
Not surprisingly perhaps, these are among the company’s fastest-growing brands.
Yet there is a limit to what any one company can achieve.
Transformational change will come only from businesses and others acting together.
Again, we are hopeful, because momentum is building.
Coalitions are being formed to tackle issues ranging from illegal deforestation to food security.
Bodies like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the global Consumer Goods Forum are uniting key industry players and putting pressure on governments to join forces in the search for sustainable capitalism.
As the cost of inaction rises, governments and businesses must continue to respond.
None of us can thrive in a world where one billion people go to bed hungry each night and 2.3 billion lack access to basic sanitation.
Nor can business thrive where public optimism about the future and trust in institutions are at historic lows.
We have a long way to go, but we believe the necessary transformation is beginning.
A growing body of evidence suggests that new business models can deliver responsible growth.
The Conference on Inclusive Capitalism represents another step forward.
Though our work has only just started, we are convinced that within a generation we can redefine capitalism and build a sustainable and equitable global economy.
We have no time to lose.
As Mahatma Gandhi once put it: “The future depends on what you do today.”

Catalyzing Consumption and Balancing Growth
WASHINGTON , DC – China has weathered the Great Recession well.
The world now waits to see if last year’s impressive domestic demand growth can be sustained, and if China can, in the words of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, “give full play to the leading role of…consumer demand in driving economic growth.”
The Chinese consumer has been held back for too long, and now must be put front and center in China’s growth model.
China’s government is already moving ahead on multiple fronts to attain this goal as was clear from announcements at this week’s National People’s Congress.
Of the many factors that have decreased the share of consumption in China’s economy, declining household disposable income has been central.
That, in turn, has reflected the fall in labor income as a share of the economy, owing in part to structural changes that have moved workers out of agriculture (where the labor share of income is high) and into manufacturing (where capital commands a larger share of income).
Concurrent with diminishing labor income, government-imposed ceilings on bank deposits – the primary savings vehicle for most households – have held down household capital income.
This fall in income has been magnified by rising household savings rates, driven by insufficient insurance for health care and old age, the high cost of education, growing income inequality, and demographic trends.
So what to do?
Recently, I attended an IMF-organized workshop in Beijing that brought together Chinese officials, academics, international analysts, and IMF staff to discuss how best to catalyze household consumption in China.
Participants emphasized that changes would be needed in multiple areas, including improving the system of taxation and social insurance, further developing housing and the service economy, and eliminating a range of relative price distortions.
One key idea was to lighten the tax burden on labor .
Taking into account the personal-income tax and various social contributions, taxation of labor income in China is too high .
To be sure, taxes are needed to finance social spending, but revenue sources other than taxes on labor income could do the job.
China could usefully explore shifting part of the burden from labor toward property, capital gains, and inheritance taxes.
Larger dividends paid to the budget from the highly profitable state-enterprise sector could also provide an alternative source of funds.
Another route to improve consumption could be to offer households greater support .
The global crisis has prompted China’s government to push ahead with its social-reform program.
Important improvements have been made over the past year to expand the pension system’s coverage, move toward universal health care, and provide public funding for basic education.
But more can be done to speed up the existing reform package, find ways to develop full coverage for catastrophic health events, and develop government-backed financing of tertiary education.
Fixing the housing market could also help spur consumption .
Distortions in the real-estate market are a powerful motivation for saving, particularly among young people who struggle to meet the high down-payment needed to buy a first home.
Part of the high cost of housing arises from an underdeveloped financial system, which makes housing one of the few alternatives to bank deposits as a store of value.
Property or capital-gains taxes could help curb demand for housing as an investment vehicle.
In addition, a comprehensive nationwide housing policy is urgently needed to ensure that housing remains affordable, particularly for those on limited incomes.
Related to this is the need for improvements in the overall financial system .
By developing markets for private pensions, commercial health insurance, and annuities, China could complement expanded government provision of social insurance and weaken the incentives that underlie high precautionary saving.
Similarly, broadening the range of available savings instruments could raise household disposable income and increase consumption.
A more developed financial system would provide alternatives to real estate as a store of value, thereby making home ownership more accessible.
These issues will be examined carefully during the course of this year as the Chinese government and the IMF collaborate on a Financial Sector Assessment Program for China.
Fostering a dynamic service economy will invariably boost consumption as well .
In the coming years, a more fully-fledged service economy will be an essential ingredient to increase employment and lessen China’s reliance on manufacturing.
But spurring faster growth in services is a complex undertaking.
Entry barriers, particularly in service industries dominated by state-owned oligopolies, need to be lowered.
Distortions in key prices that favor capital-intensive manufacturing need to be removed by raising the cost of land, energy, water, and capital.
Changing the tax structure will also help.
At present, industry is the primary source of tax revenue for the government, particularly at the local level, giving the state too little incentive to foster a service economy.
Finally, a stronger renminbi ought to be an integral part of the package of reforms to boost consumption.
A stronger currency would increase household income.
It would also create a powerful incentive for companies to expand into the service economy, providing more jobs and more choices for Chinese consumers.
If consumption can be successfully and sustainably boosted, I believe that China’s development will enter a new era, one in which economic growth continues at a rapid pace, generates higher employment, increases social welfare, places less demand on natural resources, and, ultimately, is of a much higher quality thereby underpinning more balanced global growth.

The Government Europe Deserves?
BRUSSELS – With the final allocation of portfolios within its executive branch, the European Commission, the European Union has completed its change of guard.
The process took almost four months, following the European Parliament election in late May, and the end result was inevitably based on a series of compromises – to be expected for an EU of 28 prickly nation-states.
Indeed, the proper functioning of EU institutions requires that no important constituency (left or right, East or West, and so forth) feels left out.
And the new European Commission looks rather strong, given that more than 20 of its 28 members previously served as prime ministers, deputy prime ministers, or ministers.
People who have held high political office at home find it worthwhile to come to Brussels.
But most attention has focused on the EU’s three top positions: the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Council, and the High Representative for external affairs.
The Commission’s new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was the first ever to be selected based on his faction’s strong showing in the European Parliament election.
As a seasoned Brussels insider, he was not one to move the crowds.
But sometimes this can be an advantage. An insider knows best how to reconcile contrasting interests and how to get the institutional machinery moving again, as Juncker showed with his deft handling of the distribution of tasks among the individual Commissioners.
Selecting the president of the European Council required considerable time and horse-trading, with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk emerging as the final choice.
But, though Tusk now has an important-sounding position, the European Council President decides nothing.
The president mainly presides over the meetings of the EU’s national leaders, and an incumbent’s influence depends on his or her ability to set the agenda and facilitate compromises.
The experience of the previous incumbent, former Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy, in dealing with his own country’s fractious coalitions proved very useful when he had to persuade national leaders to make decisions during the euro crisis.
Tusk will have to achieve something similar in the face of the new challenges confronting Europe today, which include Russian aggression in Ukraine, the rise of terrorism in the Middle East, and a stagnant economy at home.
On the EU’s most immediate challenge, posed by Russia, Tusk will have to broker decisions with leaders from countries that feel immediately threatened (like his own) and those for which economic ties with Russia outweigh any threat to European security, which they feel to be remote.
On the economy, he must reconcile the priorities of full-employment Germany with those of Greece and Italy, which remain in the grip of recession and sky-high unemployment.
Being able to converse directly with the Council’s members, mostly in English, might be the biggest immediate challenge, as he admitted immediately.
The appointment of the Italian foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has been widely questioned, owing to her limited executive experience in foreign policy.
But, since the de facto invasion of Ukraine in late August, her government has changed its position on Russia, and she has sought to convince many critics that she knows the problems facing Europe well (her university thesis, for example, was about political Islam).
But can she lead?
Europe’s foreign service, the European External Action Service (EEAS), is a huge bureaucracy, which must be managed well if it is to be effective.
And, though the head of the EEAS has been dubbed the “EU’s foreign-policy chief,” Mogherini should be seen as its CEO, with key decisions taken by the member states’ leaders when they convene in the European Council.
Her lack of managerial experience is thus her key weakness, and she will have to find a strong team to support her.
But there is at least one encouraging, if hidden, signal from Mogherini’s appointment: The fact that the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is also an Italian was not an impediment.
This implies that the ECB presidency is not counted among the posts to be distributed according to nationality quotas, and that Draghi’s nationality is not regarded as having influenced his decisions in any way.
Leaders of the EU’s institutions have to be political entrepreneurs if they are to leave a mark on history.
Their decision-making power is limited.
But they can often frame the choices and broker coalitions to push the existing boundaries of European integration.
None of the EU’s top three new faces (Juncker, Tusk, and Mogherini) has a track record in this sense.
Evidently the national bosses like it that way.
The most sobering message from the appointment process is thus that the member states’ leaders will not suffer anyone who might rock the boat and push integration forward.
There will be little movement toward the “ever closer union” envisioned in the Treaty of Rome.
That might come as a relief for those in the United Kingdom and elsewhere who fear domination by Brussels, but it can only dismay those who hope that, despite its sluggish economy and declining population, Europe can become a relevant global actor.

The Price of European Indifference
BAGHDAD – Europe’s migration debate has taken a disturbing turn.
It began with the creation of the catch-all concept (a legal freak) of a “migrant,” which obscures the difference, central to the law, between economic and political migration, between people escaping poverty and those driven from their homes by war.
Unlike economic migrants, those fleeing oppression, terror, and massacre have an inalienable right to asylum, which entails an unconditional obligation by the international community to provide shelter.
Even when the distinction is acknowledged, it is often as part of another sleight of hand, an attempt to convince credulous minds that the men, women, and children who paid thousands of dollars to travel on one of the rickety boats washing up on the islands of Lampedusa or Kos are economic migrants.
The reality, however, is that 80% of these people are refugees, attempting to escape despotism, terror, and religious extremism in countries like Syria, Eritrea, and Afghanistan.
That is why international law requires that the cases of asylum-seekers are examined not in bulk, but one by one.
And even when that is accepted, when the sheer number of people clamoring to get to Europe’s shores makes it all but impossible to deny the barbarity driving them to flee, a third smokescreen goes up.
Some, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, claim that the conflicts generating these refugees rage only in Arab countries that are being bombed by the West.
Here again, the figures do not lie.
The top source of refugees is Syria, where the international community has refused to conduct the kinds of military operations required by the “responsibility to protect” – even though international law demands intervention when a mad despot, having killed 240,000 of his people, undertakes to empty his country.
The West also is not bombing Eritrea, another major source of refugees.
Yet another damaging myth, perpetuated by shocking images of refugees swarming through border fences or attempting to climb onto trains in Calais, is that “Fortress Europe” is under assault by waves of barbarians.
This is wrong on two levels.
First, Europe is far from being the migrants’ primary destination.
Nearly two million refugees from Syria alone have headed to Turkey, and one million have fled to Lebanon, whose population amounts to just 3.5 million.
Jordan, with a population of 6.5 million, has taken in nearly 700,000.
Meanwhile, Europe, in a display of united selfishness, has scuttled a plan to relocate a mere 40,000 asylum-seekers from their cities of refuge in Italy and Greece.
Second, the minority who do choose Germany, France, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, or Hungary are not enemies who have come to destroy us or even to sponge off of European taxpayers.
They are applicants for freedom, lovers of our promised land, our social model, and our values.
They are people who cry out “Europe! Europe!” the way millions of Europeans, arriving a century ago on Ellis Island, learned to sing “America the Beautiful.”
Then there is the ugly rumor that this imaginary assault has been clandestinely orchestrated by the strategists of a “great replacement,” with foreigners supplanting native Europeans, or, worse, by agents of an international jihad, in which today’s migrants are tomorrow’s terrorists on bullet trains.
It should go without saying that this is nonsense.
Taken together, these distortions and delusions have had serious consequences.
For starters, the Mediterranean Sea has been all but abandoned to human smugglers.
The Mare Nostrum is gradually becoming the kind of vast and watery mass grave described by a faraway poet.
Some 2,350 people have drowned already this year.
But, for most Europeans, these people are little more than statistics, just as the women and men who have survived the journey remain unidentified and indistinguishable, a threatening anonymous mass.
Our society of the spectacle, normally so quick to manufacture an instant celebrity to serve as the “face” of the crisis du jour (anything from swine flu to a truckers’ strike), has not taken an interest in the fate of a single one of the “migrants.”
These individuals – whose course to Europe resembles that of the Phoenician Princess Europa, who arrived from Tyre on Zeus’s back several millennia ago – are being wholly rejected; indeed, walls are being constructed to keep them out.
The result is another group of people being denied basic rights.
Such people, as Hannah Arendt once observed, will ultimately come to see in the commission of a crime their only path into the world of law and of those who enjoy the rights the law confers.
Europe, harassed by its xenophobes and consumed by self-doubt, has turned its back on its values.
Indeed, it has forgotten what it is.
The bell tolls not only for the migrants, but also for a Europe whose humanistic patrimony is crumbling before our very eyes.

Expansion and Democracy in Europe
Europe is poised on the rim of two nearly revolutionary undertakings: eastward expansion and the possibility of a draft constitution for the European Union.
Both should be treated as inextricably linked.
I support EU-enlargement.
It is an historical necessity.
However, expansion must go hand-in-hand with institutional reforms that improve both the EU's capacity to act and its democratic legitimacy.
Since communism's fall, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe have undergone exhilarating yet wrenching transitions.
The biggest danger posed by that rather abrupt and harsh process of transformation is that, in trying to become open, a society risks disintegrating in the effort.
This may happen when old structures are swept away, and are not replaced with new ones in a prudent way.
Open societies demand reliable institutions, and these cannot be created overnight.
Making that difficult passage from closed to open society was a necessary step for the states of Central and Eastern Europe to become candidate members and - perhaps soon - full members of the EU.
Enormous effort was expended by them - something not fully understood by current EU members - to accomplish their domestic transformations and so adapt themselves to the incredibly extensive acquis of the Union.
But the EU still must prove to the countries seeking to join it that the Union is a truly open, democratic society of the type they have struggled to make of themselves.
That question has practical implications, for if the EU is to manifest itself as a free and open society it must assure its ability to function both effectively and efficiently when expansion takes place.
Here is where the constitutional assembly underway in Brussels can and must link enlargement with reform of the Union, for enlargement must also be used to strengthen the transparency and democratic legitimacy of the EU.
The Council of Nice in 2000 sought to restructure the Union for the time when enlargement will double its membership to 27.
But the Nice meeting failed miserably.
An important step not taken was to end the principle of unanimity that rules decisionmaking in the EU Council of Ministers, and replacing it with a system of qualified-majority voting.
So long as unanimity remains, the more countries that take part in decisionmaking, the bigger the danger of a single veto blocking action.
Reform of the structures and working procedures of the EU Commission is also an urgent need.
Because of the system of collegiality, the sheer number of commissioners even now strains the Commission's decisionmaking capacity.
If, in future, every country continues to send at least one commissioner to Brussels, the process will grind to a crawl, if not a halt.
Better to radically reduce the size of the Commission, and to either tie countries into regional packages for Commission representation or rotate membership every few years among countries.
But the most important question of EU democracy is this: a nation can vote its government out of office when it is not satisfied, but this is not possible in the EU.
The Commission cannot be voted out of office because it was never actually voted into office.
The European parliament is also not yet a real parliament, with control of the purse and oversight of the executive.
Both must change.
The European parliament must exercise effective democratic control on the European level.
It must receive full sovereignty over EU budget-making and the right to sign-off on all decisions taken by a qualified majority in the Council.
As to the EU's executive, the Commission, or at least its president, must be elected - in the long-term it may be elected directly by European citizens, and in the interim, at least by members of the European parliament.
The Nice conference failed because the EU's national leaders could not, or would not, reach beyond their immediate national interests to take a pan-European perspective.
But the Union's capacity to act as a union is now a pre-condition to securing each European country's national interests.
If the events of September 11 th have taught us anything, they have shown that purely national answers to vital questions are either unavailable or unviable.
As the Union reforms itself internally to strengthen its democratic character and become a truly open society, it must not close itself off from those outside it.
At the very moment when today's candidate countries strive for EU membership, EU enlargement is feared by those states that are unlikely to join the Union for the foreseeable future.
After the current round of enlargement is completed, the EU's eastern border will likely run to the east of the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova on the other side.
The Union must see to it that this border is not a new wall dividing Europe, and that the zone of stability and prosperity it has created for its members spreads to the EU's eastern neighbors as well.
Membership in the EU should not be the determining factor in European statecraft.
Our shared European values should matter most.
The EU's ability to create peace and stability - not to mention economic prosperity - is unique in modern history.
Indeed, the current state of the world shows how necessary a common European foreign and security policy is.
Today there is not too much America - as some maintain - but too little Europe.
The challenge facing the delegates at the Brussels convention is nothing less than creating an open, democratic, and yes, greater, Europe.

Getting Past the American Election
The pundits have now weighed in mightily in interpreting the American presidential election.
Did the outcome - together with Republican gains in the Congress - represent an endorsement of Bush's positions?
Has the American electorate swung to the right?
Are Americans now more concerned about "values?"
Like price in economics, a single electoral choice compresses a lot of information.
It is a summary of whether, taking everything into account, a citizen prefers one candidate to another.
A host of surveys is required to figure out what it really means, for the United States - and for the world.
This much is clear, however: there is little confidence in Bush's economic policies.
The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago, and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration.
But while Bush was not held back four years ago by the lack of a popular mandate in pushing his agenda, he may be emboldened by the seeming ringing endorsement to push even harder - such as making the tax cuts permanent and partially privatizing social security.
If adopted, these measures will further compound America's fiscal mess.
To the rest of the world, these are America's problems.
Yes, the soaring deficits may contribute somewhat to international financial instability.
Real interest rates may rise, as America borrows more and more.
If declining confidence in US fiscal policy leads to a weaker dollar, Europe and Asia may find it more difficult to export, and if the deficits prove a drag on the American economy, global growth may stall.
But for much of the rest of the world, the real concern is American unilateralism.
An interconnected world needs cooperation and collective action.
Historically, the US has exercised enormous leadership in a world committed to the proposition that no state should dictate collective decisions.
Unfortunately, over the past four years, America's president has lost the credibility necessary to exercise that leadership.
Even if the 59 million votes cast for Bush represented a ringing endorsement of his Iraq policy, it would not restore America's international credibility.
I believe most Americans reject Bush's unilateralism no less than his administration's economic policies.
Before the invasion of Iraq, they wanted America to go to the UN, and today they recognize that America alone cannot maintain order in the Middle East.
Even if Iraq is to bear more of the cost of its own reconstruction, there will have to be debt forgiveness, and this too requires international cooperation.
Those who voted for Bush may not be as outraged by American involvement in torture, or the misleading information about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connections with Al Qaeda, as those abroad.
But they do not want America alone to shoulder the burdens of international peace, and they are gradually coming to the realization that leadership and cooperation do not come automatically, simply because America is the only superpower.
Some worry whether Bush will use his electoral mandate to engage in more ventures.
As he himself put it, "I earned capital in the campaign … and now I intend to spend it."
Had the Iraq venture been more successful, these worries would have been justified.
There is little secret that there were discussions concerning Iran.
But the doctrine of preemptive war has been badly tarnished, and I remain hopeful that Congress and the American people have learned a painful lesson.
Peace will not quickly be restored to Iraq, and it is hard to conceive of opening up a major new front, when America can hardly manage what it has already undertaken.
Others will, of course, have to continue to bear the costs of the mistaken and mismanaged adventure in Iraq.
Instability in the Middle East will continue to limit oil supplies, discouraging the expansion of production.
High oil prices will dampen global growth in the remainder of 2004 and into 2005.
In the short run, the only response is more conservation, and America's allies should put pressure on America to conserve. (Another reason stems from recent reports concerning the rapid melting of the polar ice cap, which seem to reconfirm worries about global warming.)
Presidents do make a difference, but every president operates within constraints.
The good news is that the constraints that Bush and the American government will face in the next four years will almost surely limit the damage they will cause.
The rhetoric and posturing, the lack of commitment to human rights or democratic processes, may be - and should be - upsetting, but there will be far more bark than bite.
While America may continue on a path of unilateralism, other countries' stance will make a difference.
Some suggest that the US constitution provided fewer constraints on the president in the conduct of foreign policy, because the requisite checks and balances were to be provided by the powers of the time - Britain and France.
Today, with the US as the only superpower, it is even more important for countries to stand up and express their views - and to stick by them even when pressured.
Some worry that this will worsen relations with the US.
But long-term relationships are based on friendship and respect; coherent, well-argued positions will earn that respect.
Today, many Americans, especially the young, feel far more respect for the countries that recognized the lack of evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction than for those whose leaders repeated the American distortions.
It may be unfortunate that Realpolitik is the order of the day, but it is, so others must learn to play the same game.
Standing up for multilateralism and international rule of law may not only be the morally right thing to do; it is also in the interests of America's allies and, ultimately, America itself.

Women, Work, and India’s Rickshaw Revolution
BENGALURU – When resources are limited, it is human capital that defines the sustainable development of a community, especially in the case of costly misallocation and underutilization, as is often the case in developing countries.
Nowhere is this truer than in India, where the value of the current demographic dividend hinges on a grossly underutilized resource pool – the female workforce.
Despite rising education levels and a female literacy rate of 65%, only about a quarter of Indian women participate in the labor force.
Increasing women’s workforce participation by a mere ten percentage points could add $700 billion to India’s GDP by 2025.
And that requires removing one of the main obstacles to achieving this objective: broken transportation services.
Astha (name changed), a 35-year-old teacher working in the district headquarters of Jhunjhunu, in the state of Rajasthan, is one of the youngest teachers ever to be nominated for a promotion to school headmistress.
But accepting the promotion meant transferring farther away from home.
She took the new position, only to find the commute difficult and unsafe, as she left in the early hours of the morning, walking 1.5-2 kilometers every day.
Two months into her new role, unable to depend on being escorted by family members to the bus depot daily, she gave up the job and returned to a lower position at the nearby school.
Lack of reliable transportation led her to give up this opportunity.
According to the National Sample Survey Office, more than 60% of rural and urban households use buses as their main mode of public transportation, followed by auto-rickshaws, taxis, railways, and cycle rickshaws.
While we have come a long way in reach and coverage when it comes to bus and rail networks, India’s door-to-door transportation network is still dispersed and unreliable.
Unfortunately, working women are the most severely affected by inadequate service.
When safe and efficient public transit is unavailable, women typically settle for lower-paid jobs closer to home.
This is reflected in the distance women travel for work in urban areas.
In Bengaluru, for example, the average daily commute for women is just over a mile, while men travel twice as far for their jobs.
In Delhi, 75% of women work within a three-mile radius of home, whereas 75% of men work within eight miles.
The biggest transportation roadblock for women in India lies in what planners call the first-last mile problem – getting to and from the station, a concern that Astha knows well.
While this problem is a feature of any transportation network, in developing countries it adds significantly more time, cost, and safety constraints to every journey.
In Delhi, for example, the first and last miles constitute 41% of the total time and 47% of the total cost of the trip.
Clearly, the consequences of the first-last mile challenge are profound – not only for women, but also for India’s economy.
How, then, can planners improve transportation to get more women working?
There is only one persuasive answer: better auto-rickshaws.
India has more three-wheeled vehicles than any other country, and every day, millions of people are whisked through narrow streets and congested traffic in these easy-to-maneuver carts.
Yet Indian rickshaws have not evolved in the last 50 years to serve either the rider’s or the driver’s needs.
They are poorly distributed, unsafe, and not future-ready.
To solve women’s urban mobility challenges, we need a completely reimagined vehicle that is electric, shared, safe, and “smart.”
Indian women’s travel is characterized by “trip chaining.”
They make shorter and more frequent trips than men, and their trips often involve more stops, to run errands, shop, pick up children from school, and so forth. This increases their dependency on first- and last-mile transportation.
However, most rickshaws operating in India today are unorganized and ply only the busiest, most lucrative routes.
With the right innovations in technology and policy, we can bring order to the scattershot nature of India’s auto-rickshaw fleet and bridge the demand-supply gap.
For example, ride-hailing apps and booking platforms could efficiently match rider demand with rickshaw supply, as would well-orchestrated feeder services to bus and rail networks.
Policies that encourage ride sharing could multiply fleet capacity.
In terms of safety, it is necessary to consider both accidents and crime or harassment.
For starters, nearly 40% of all accidents involving these vehicles cause them to topple.
And a study in Delhi showed that 51% of women had faced some form of harassment while using public transport, and 42% while waiting for it.
We need innovations in accident-prevention systems and other technologies that would make such technologies a feature of low-cost three-wheelers.
Technology can also help connect transportation nodes and vehicles to police and medical systems, substantially reducing the response times for emergency services.
Safety from crime, on the other hand, needs a connected, smart ecosystem with auto-rickshaws at its heart.
Rickshaws equipped with GPS systems could enable passengers to share real-time location data with family or friends.
A mandatory SOS alert system would give passengers and drivers a means to call for help, regardless of whether they were carrying a mobile phone.
Government regulations already require panic buttons in taxis, public buses, and other public transport; requiring them for rickshaws is the natural next step.
Last but not least, we need these reimagined vehicles to be future-ready.
Air pollution is a ticking bomb: 14 of the 15 cities with the world’s highest concentrations of fine particulate matter are in India, underscoring the urgency of switching to low-carbon, battery-powered vehicles.
When women can travel to work conveniently, choosing affordable transportation, without fear of harassment or abuse, India will have arrived.
Talented women like Astha will never need to choose between a job they love and a commute they loathe.
Indian women need affordable, safe, and reliable options to help them overcome the first-last mile problem.
A reimagined rickshaw may be just the ticket.

What About Rochester?
SANTIAGO – The rise of megacities as centers of strong job creation is one of the defining characteristics of the twenty-first-century global economy.
But it is not always a positive feature.
In the developing world, as staggering as the challenges are (greater New Delhi, for example, has been absorbing 700,000 new inhabitants per year), urbanization remains the best hope for alleviating poverty.
But in advanced economies, far along the so-called Lewis development curve, it is far less obvious that concentrating economic opportunity in ever-larger cities is necessarily the right or only path forward.
The reasons why powerhouses such as New York, San Francisco, and London have become increasingly dominant economically are well known.
Large cities offering a huge array of interesting jobs, cultural attractions, and nightlife are a magnet for young unattached workers.
And the combination of large masses of highly specialized workers and firms leads to network and agglomeration effects that are difficult for smaller cities to match, particularly in areas like tech, biotech, and finance.
But there are downsides, particularly high living costs – especially for housing – and huge amounts of time lost in traffic congestion.
Although architects and city planners are continually offering imaginative new blueprints for large cities, the severe strains on physical infrastructure are increasingly difficult to manage.
Meanwhile, many smaller and midsize cities struggle to maintain economic dynamism.
Rochester, New York, where I grew up, is mentioned prominently as one of many examples in MIT economists Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson’s interesting new book, Jump-Starting America.
In the decades after World War II, Rochester was one of the wealthiest cities in the United States.
Home to Eastman Kodak, Xerox, and Bausch and Lomb, Rochester was a mini-Silicon Valley.
Unfortunately, these companies were hammered first by global competition (especially from Japan), and then by technological innovation: digital cameras in the case of Kodak, personal copiers and modular replacement parts in the case of Xerox.
Today, at under 1.1 million people, the population of the greater Rochester metropolitan area has grown only marginally since 1990, and the city itself has shrunk to 200,000, from a peak of 300,000.
Although it is home to great universities, a world-class hospital, and a nationally recognized philharmonic orchestra, Rochester struggles to compete with large East Coast cities for dynamic job-producing industries, and increasingly lacks the resources to cope with growing urban problems.
For example, East High School (which I attended) has struggled in recent years just to remain open.
In general, many small and midsize cities find themselves abandoned by young professionals and left behind to contend with aging populations and insufficient tax revenues.
Is there anything policymakers can do to make these struggling cities more attractive, both to enhance growth and to relieve population pressure in the megacities?
Gruber and Johnson suggest, among other things, locating new federally funded basic-research facilities in midsize cities that might serve as talent magnets and hubs for localized growth.
Jim O’Neill has argued for creating regional economic powerhouses in the United Kingdom by building high-speed transport links between neighboring midsize cities, as China has done.
To these ideas I would add better enforcement of anti-trust policies.
As matters currently stand, when the next George Eastman (the founder of Eastman Kodak) or Joseph Wilson (the founder of Xerox) comes along, some market-dominant incumbent will most likely persuade or force (or some combination of the two) them to move to an established tech hub. Rochester will receive much less spinoff benefit than it might have otherwise.
One advantage to the anti-trust approach is that the government would not be picking winners and losers, just ensuring that the same region does not always win.
A second additional step would be to invest government resources in creating free high-quality online education resources, particularly technical material of all types.
Surely, this is a much better and more forward-looking approach than investing in free college for all; for one thing, it recognizes that education and re-education in the twenty-first century is a life-long enterprise.
One important input would be to provide universal free basic Internet (as legal scholars Ganesh Sitaraman and Anne Alstott advocate in their thought-provoking new book, The Public Option).
Perhaps the phenomenon of winner-take-all megacities will not last.
After all, until about 1980, the trend had very much been in the other direction, going back to the start of mass production of automobiles, which helped fuel growth in smaller metropolitan areas.
That all stopped, of course, with the rise of personal computers and the Internet.
At some point, there will likely be an invention or new business model that helps more fully realize the promise of telecommuting – perhaps one that more thoroughly and continuously integrates remote workers into the central office.
And perhaps global warming will sharply increase costs in coastal cities and make Rochester’s winters milder.
There is much to be celebrated in the rise of modern megacities.
But if the trend persists, greater public and private innovation will be required to strike a better regional growth balance.
The need to address such development problems is not limited to emerging economies.

The Arab Winter of Discontent
BEIRUT – A new wave of revolts is shaking the Arab world, with Lebanon and Iraq now joining Sudan and Algeria.
Recent mass protests in each country have mobilized millions of people from all walks of life, all of whom are angry over the deterioration of economic conditions, which is seen as being exacerbated by mismanagement and poor governance.
As during the 2011 Arab Spring, today’s protests in each country have coalesced around demands for regime change.
But there is a key difference: while people’s yearning for dignity fueled those earlier uprisings, today’s protests are propelled by people’s hunger.
The Arab Spring has given way to a harsh winter of discontent.
Back in 2011, oil prices were at a peak, and many Arab economies were growing at their fastest pace in decades.
Those leading the uprisings were predominantly educated young people who aspired to better jobs and more of a voice in politics and society.
Many of the region’s governments were able to calm the streets with the help of expansionary economic policies financed by oil revenues, support from Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and remittances.
But with the collapse in oil prices in 2014, much of this fiscal space disappeared.
Ten governments in the region already have debt-to-GDP ratios over 75%.
As growth has slowed, public expenditures have declined, fueling economic insecurity.
Even where fiscal adjustment has barely started, the old model of rent distribution has become unaffordable, and the population has turned against regimes that seem unable or unwilling to make a convincing reformist effort.
Moreover, the new popular movements in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon, and Iraq have absorbed important lessons from the 2011 uprisings.
No longer content with merely displacing aging autocrats, protesters are also targeting key elements of the deep state and the security forces.
In Algeria and Sudan, they have rejected quick elections and instead demanded time for new parties to organize, so that they can compete with long-established Islamist organizations.
In addition to demanding wholesale changes to the political system, the current protesters have refused to negotiate with the old regime.
In Algeria’s case, the combination of $70 billion in foreign reserves and little foreign debt means that the protest movement and the armed forces can afford to maintain the current game of chicken, with the former waiting for the regime to disintegrate and the latter holding out for popular demobilization.
The risk, of course, is that a resolution will not be reached until the fiscal cushion is gone, at which point economic reforms will be much harder to implement.
By contrast, in Sudan, the democratic front reluctantly agreed in August to enter into a power-sharing arrangement with the army.
The economy has collapsed to such a degree that cooperation has become the more desirable strategy.
The army cannot continue to consume 60% of state expenditures now that these have shrunk to 8% of GDP.
For the time being, a technocratic government has been put in charge of stabilizing the economy, leaving the ultimate political bargain for the future – and leaving both sides maneuvering to benefit from the eventual transition.
In this sense, both Lebanon and Iraq are still closer to Algeria than to Sudan, but their economies are now deteriorating rapidly.
While Iraq is reeling from declining oil revenues, Lebanon has been unsettled by falling capital inflows, the country’s main source of external rent.
These economic shocks have exposed the huge costs of each country’s sectarian-based political system.
And demonstrators, driven by economic grievances, have been emboldened by an improvement in broader security conditions, owing to the defeat of the Islamic State and the wind-down of the war in Syria.
In all four of these countries, the severity of economic mismanagement reflects the long-standing use of state expenditures to finance the regime’s allies and clients, rather than to benefit the whole population.
These regimes have dominated each country’s private sector through cronyism, not just to extract and distribute rents to clients, but also to block the emergence of autonomous entities that could finance an opposition movement.
As a result, capital and skills have been misallocated, the business climate has deteriorated, and competition, innovation, and growth have suffered.
The situations in Iraq and Lebanon are further complicated by the diversity of each country’s population.
The regimes that emerged after Lebanon’s civil war in the 1990s, and after the United States-led invasion of Iraq in the early 2000s, rest on power-sharing deals between sectarian oligarchs who maintain their positions through oppression and clientelism.
These coalitions could be maintained as long as there were ample spoils to divide among each party’s respective clients.
But as rents have declined, the parties have been unable to agree on how to distribute losses, and have instead made a desperate dash for the remaining resources, precipitating an economic crisis.
In Lebanon, the costs of this folly are now being borne by an already-fragile financial sector, which could implode.
Finally, regional geopolitical dynamics have also played a role in Lebanese and Iraqi domestic politics.
In both countries, political groups supported by Iran possess firepower, but have proven incapable, so far, of crafting a broadly acceptable social contract that would enable them to consolidate their political position.
In any case, history is on the march in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon, and Iraq.
Oil revenues across the Middle East have plunged by about one-third since 2014, leaving autocratic regimes with fewer resources to finance clientelism.
As we enter the winter of 2020, this new wave of public discontent is likely to grow and engulf other countries.
The challenge for each country will be to find a path to a political and economic transition that can satisfy the street and create conditions conducive to widely shared prosperity.
So far, however, aging regimes, faced with popular movements demanding a more just and productive social contract, are resorting to outright repression, which has so far only emboldened the population to demand more concessions.
What comes next is anyone’s guess.
No Arab country – not even democratizing Tunisia, where the region’s uprisings in 2011 began – has yet discovered a credible way forward.

The Two Faces of Vladimir Putin
Russia’s split personality – symbolized by its Tsarist coat of arms, a two-headed eagle – has been on open display recently.
One minute, President Vladimir Putin’s regime is on a charm offensive, desiring a settlement to its six-decade-old territorial dispute with Japan over the Kurile Islands and reassuring investors following the conviction of oil billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
The next moment Putin balks at removing Russia’s military garrison from Moldova’s secessionist Transdniester region while prosecutors talk ominously of putting more oligarchs in the dock.
Perhaps the greatest display of this political schizophrenia took place last month in Red Square, where a witch’s brew of Red “Victory” flags, tri-color “Imperial” flags, Stalin portraits, and Orthodox icons marched side by side during the 60th anniversary celebration marking WWII’s end.
Putin took that occasion to repeat his political mantra – “Russia is developing it’s own brand of democracy” – while spurning requests from the Baltic countries that Russia come clean about its deal with Hitler to devour them on WWII’s eve.
This bizarre brew appears to have been concocted in an effort to reconcile the irreconcilable: the current yearning for democracy with Russia’s despotic past.
But, like any muddle, it is succeeding only in confusing Russians about themselves and their country.
Strangely, Putin seems as trapped by this muddle as everybody else.
At times, Putin truly sees himself as a “modernizer” seeking to root Russia in the West.
At other times, like Stalin, he believes that Russia’s power requires a strong hand – what he calls his “dictatorship of law.”
The problem, as Khodorkovsky’s conviction demonstrated, is that dictatorship usually seems to be trumping law.
Historically, attempts at modernization in Russia, even when they look real, as with Stalin’s industrialization or Yeltsin’s market reforms, ultimately result in a Potemkin village-like state of affairs, because Russian society cannot change fast enough or with the patience necessary to see the changes through.
So, when Yeltsin’s American-style democratization of the 1990’s failed to bring “orderly” capitalism instantly, Putin on his accession imposed a restoration of state “order,” as if a stable political or economic system demanded a fusing of the Soviet past with the Orthodox Church and Mother Russia imagery.
Indeed, Putin’s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia’s people.
By blending the Soviet past with the Tsarist past and a few shards of Yeltsin-era democracy, Putin seems to think that he can neutralize the extremes of Russian history.
Instead, the extremes seem to be squeezing out the desire for modernization.
High oil prices now seem to be the only factor allowing Putin to keep the reform charade going.
The nineteenth-century czar Alexander III once said: “Russia has only two true allies – its army and its navy.”
Oil is Putin’s army and navy, allowing him to build and maintain the image of a strong, but also an internationalist, state.
Alexander's formula is also popular today with Putin’s nationalists in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
In his pro-imperial Russia film “The Barber of Siberia,” the Oscar-winning director Nikita Mikhalkov – whose father composed the Stalin-era national anthem that Putin recently revived – used the coronation of Alexander III as the symbolic centerpiece of Russia’s greatness, inviting Russian leaders to walk in his footsteps.
This strong-willed monarch, while ruling the Russian empire autocratically, managed to bring stability and prosperity, allowing capitalism to take root.
He worked to strengthen and modernize Russia’s armed forces while avoiding armed conflict.
He became known as “The Peasants’ Tsar,” though he didn’t tolerate any opposition thinking contrary to his own.
Putin sees his own crusade to save Russia from disintegration and separatism as similar to Alexander’s.
But how forward-looking is it to model a twenty-first-century country on the absolutist example of the past?
Stalin is yet another cherished role model.
Here, too, Putin tries to walk on both sides of the street, calling Koba a tyrant to sooth the wounded feelings the Baltic leaders, yet instantly qualifying his remarks by saying that Stalin was no Hitler.
Can we really compare the degree of evil of these two men?
Despite his insistence on rubbing shoulders with world leaders and portraying himself as a modernizer, Putin, like his predecessors, is in fact a ruler who believes that only authoritarian rule can protect his country from anarchy and disintegration.
But the old ideas, the mimicry and symbols Putin employs to achieve his goals, no longer correspond to today’s realities or Russia’s present capabilities.
Previously, it was Russia’s Western mission that was pure Potemkin village.
Now Russianness itself seems to lack a secure foundation, for it is but a hollow shell of discarded state symbols.
Like a bad driver, a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash.

Closing Africa’s Agricultural Gender Gap
SEATTLE – Africa’s GDP is now growing faster than any other continent’s.
When many people think about the engines driving that growth, they imagine commodities like oil, gold, and cocoa, or maybe industries like banking and telecommunications.
I think of a woman named Joyce Sandir.
Joyce is a farmer who grows bananas, vegetables, and maize on a small plot of land in rural Tanzania.
When I met her in 2012, she had just harvested her first crop of maize grown from a seed specifically adapted for Tanzania’s climate.
Even during a bad crop year that caused many of Joyce’s vegetables to wither and die, her maize crop flourished.
Without it, her family might have risked going hungry.
Instead, the maize harvest ensured that Joyce’s family had enough to eat – and even enough extra income for Joyce to pay her children’s school fees.
As Joyce’s story demonstrates, agriculture is crucial to Africa’s future.
Farmers make up 70% of Africa’s workforce.
They are the foundation of its economy, and the key to triggering its broader growth.
Research shows that increasing agricultural productivity is the most effective way to reduce poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.
In fact, agriculture offers the continent its best opportunity to turn a vicious cycle of poverty into a virtuous cycle of development.
That is why leaders and policymakers from across the continent have declared 2014 Africa’s Year of Agriculture and Food Security.
Joyce’s story is relevant for another reason, too.
She is important to Africa’s future not only because she is a farmer, but also because she is a woman.
At the Gates Foundation, I spend a lot of my time understanding the many ways that women and girls drive development forward: by investing in their children’s nutrition, basic health, and education – and also by providing farm labor.
What I am now learning is that if Africa hopes to spark an agricultural transformation, countries will first need to remove one of the main barriers holding the sector back: a pervasive gender gap.
This gap is not about the number of women farmers.
In fact, roughly half of Africa’s farmers are women.
The gap is one of productivity.
Across the continent, farms controlled by women tend to produce less per hectare than farms controlled by men.
The world has had evidence of this gender gap since at least 2011, but only limited data about its scope, shape, and causes.
To help us better understand the problem, the World Bank and the ONE Campaign recently conducted an unprecedented analysis of the challenges facing women farmers.
Their report highlights one stark fact from the start: The gender gap is real, and in some cases it is extreme.
When we compare male and female farmers with similar land sizes across similar settings, the productivity gap can be as high as 66%, as it is in Niger.
Previously, experts believed that women’s farms produced less because women have less access to inputs like fertilizer, water, and even information. But we now know that the story is much more complicated.
With the new data in hand, we can see that, surprisingly, the productivity gap persists even when women have equal access to inputs.
The precise reasons vary from country to country – but many of them stem from entrenched cultural norms that prevent women from reaching their full potential.
For example, the report found that women face obstacles mobilizing the labor they need to help their farms flourish.
Women usually have more childcare and household responsibilities than men, which make it difficult for them to devote as much time to farm work, or even to supervise hired labor.
The problem is compounded by the fact that women are also likely to have less income to hire laborers in the first place.
Fortunately, the new data do not just map the complexity and depth of the problem; they also point to concrete opportunities to develop gender-responsive policies that will help unlock the promise of all of Africa’s farmers.
In some places, that may mean teaching agricultural extension workers how to make their messages more relevant to female audiences, or encouraging them to visit when women are most likely to be at home.
In other places, it may mean increasing women’s access to markets, or introducing labor-saving tools to help them get the highest yield from their land.
It may also require establishing community childcare centers, so that women farmers have the option to spend more time farming.
In every case, it will require African policymakers to start recognizing women farmers as the essential economic partners that they are.
This June, leaders from all over Africa will meet in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, to set the agenda for agricultural policy in the next decade.
If Africa’s agricultural sector is to achieve its promise – and if Africa’s economic growth is to continue – policymakers should take into account the needs of farmers like Joyce.
Hers is a success story that can – and must – be replicated across the continent.

Death by Renminbi
WASHINGTON, DC – Over the last several weeks, the dollar’s depreciation against the euro and yen has grabbed global attention.
In a normal world, the dollar’s weakening would be welcome, as it would help the United States come to grips with its unsustainable trade deficit. But, in a world where China links its currency to the dollar at an under-valued parity, the dollar’s depreciation risks major global economic damage that will further complicate recovery from the current worldwide recession.
A realignment of the dollar is long overdue.
Its overvaluation began with the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, and was officially enshrined by the “strong dollar” policy adopted after the East Asian financial crisis of 1997.
That policy produced short-term consumption gains for America, which explains why it was popular with American politicians, but it has inflicted major long-term damage on the US economy and contributed to the current crisis.
The over-valued dollar caused the US economy to hemorrhage spending on imports, jobs via off-shoring, and investment to countries with under-valued currencies.
In today’s era of globalization, marked by flexible and mobile production networks, exchange rates affect more than exports and imports. They also affect the location of production and investment.
China has been a major beneficiary of America’s strong-dollar policy, to which it wedded its own “weak renminbi” policy.
As a result, China’s trade surplus with the US rose from $83 billion in 2001 to $258 billion in 2007, just before the recession.
So far in 2009, China’s surplus has accounted for 75% of the total US non-oil-goods trade deficit.
The under-valued renminbi has also made China a major recipient of foreign direct investment, even leading the world in 2002 – a staggering achievement for a developing country.
The scale of recent US trade deficits was always unsustainable, and the dollar has therefore fallen against the yen, euro, Brazilian real, and Australian and Canadian dollars. But China retains its under-valued exchange rate policy, so that the renminbi has appreciated relatively less against the dollar.
When combined with China’s rapid growth in manufacturing capacity, this pattern promises to create a new round of global imbalances.
China’s policy creates adversarial currency competition with the rest of the world.
By maintaining an undervalued currency, China is preventing the US from reducing its bilateral trade deficit.
Furthermore, the problem is not only America’s.
China’s currency policy gives it a competitive advantage relative to other countries, allowing it to displace their exports to the US.
Worse still, other countries whose currencies have appreciated against the renminbi can look forward to a Chinese import invasion.
China’s currency policy means that dollar depreciation, rather than improving America’s trade balance and stanching its leakage of jobs and investment, may inadvertently spread these problems to the rest of the world.
In effect, China is fostering new imbalances at a time when countries are struggling with the demand shortfall caused by the financial crisis.
The dollar is part of an exchange-rate Rubik’s cube.
With China retaining its under-valued currency policy, dollar depreciation can aggravate global deflationary forces.
Yet a mix of political factors has led to stunning refusal by policymakers to confront China.
On the US side, a lingering Cold War mentality, combined with the presumption of US economic superiority, has meant that economic issues are still deemed subservient to geo-political concerns.
That explains the neglect of US-China economic relations, a neglect that is now dangerous to the US, given its weakened economic condition.
With regard to the rest of the world, many find it easy to blame the US, often owing to resentment at its perceived arrogance.
Moreover, there is an old mentality among Southern countries that they can do no wrong in their relationships with the North, and that they should exhibit solidarity with each other regarding those relationships.
Finally, all countries likely have been shortsighted, imagining that silence will gain them commercial favors from China. But that silence merely allows China to exploit the community of nations.
The world economy has paid dearly for complicity with and silence about the economic policies of the last 15 years, which have culminated in the deepest and most dangerous recession since the 1930’s.
It will pay still more if policymakers remain passive about China’s destructive currency policy.

The Revolt Of The States
BUENOS AIRES: Ceaseless change seems to be at the heart of today’s global civilization.
Because of this, countries that consider their domestic realities as sacrosanct find themselves unable to assimilate change or foresee its direction.
To them, change appears as something irrational, even as a catastrophe.
As we saw in the anti-IMF protests in Prague recently, and last year’s street protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, such fears are spreading far and wide.
People increasingly see change not as something that enhances their freedom and dignity but as a force encouraging avarice and unfairness.
By concentrating wealth narrowly, globalization produces more threats than opportunities.
The difficulty in transferring knowledge and new technologies from the center to the periphery, for example, widens economic disparity and subjugates some countries to a new form of colonialism.
Seeing this, many people fear a new dominant class intolerably manipulating globalization for its betterment.
By limiting prospects for growth for many people, today’s international economic order is inconsistent with the ideals of the great democratic revolution of our century, which says that no inhabitant of the world should be left behind.
For those peoples and countries now marginalized from the process of technological development, production, and exchange I believe that only one viable option exists: a new assertion of themselves as independent states, regionally integrated in as many ways as possible.
Only with independence does the confidence for greater participation come, and greater participation means improved governance, both in the international order and domestically.
Ungovernablity arises from attempts to maintain control over people and places who are marginalized from participating in decisions that determine their daily lives.
Citizens and countries alike become “ungovernable” when they see themselves as passive instruments of decisions taken by a closed elite that rules by transforming them into a mute “mass”.
For free individuals – free citizens, free states – are the real protagonists of governance.
Without full and equal responsibility there can be no lasting governance.
This is what market fundamentalists, management consultants, and technocrats fail to understand.
Countries, citizens, users, consumers, producers, workers, entrepreneurs, professionals cannot be left out of the decisions that hold significant consequences for their lives and goals, indeed for the very values of society.
People in the United States and Western Europe recognize how continuity in their democratic systems enhanced their prosperity.
By contrast, we in Latin America and Eastern Europe know that democracy has trouble surviving in times of crisis, poverty, and isolation.
Preserving democratic values is hard when large sectors cannot integrate with the global market, when misery obliterates human dignity and a lack of options makes freedom meaningless.
It is a bitter paradox, indeed, that the developed democracies use the power of globalization to punish us commercially by discriminating against our citizens and exports.
In individual states protection of the weak is attained by equal application of the rule of law.
This must also be made true in international relations.
But to create an international order based on law and not force – economic force having replaced military might – it is necessary to strengthen and spread multilateralism into political fields as well in economic ones.
Only the cooperation of free and equal nations can bring this about.
Related to this is the fact that nowadays economic development depends less on a particular country and more on regional integration, which can serve to avoid the negative effects of those financial speculations boosted by globalization.
So the world needs, in its regions, to facilitate integration on the basis of a general economic democratization: currency compatibility, free trade, shared legal rules and most of all a common will to fix the rules of the game according to a region’s entire interests.
Only such equal cooperation can secure the solid political basis for integration.
So long as a country is subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization, its future is in foreign hands.
But in agreeing to open regional economies to imports, poor and developing countries must be allowed some means to protect their new industries.
There is justice in this, particularly given the hypocrisy of those countries who proclaim their faith in free trade while every day praying at the altar of protectionism.
Everyone acknowledges that the market requires rules in order to avoid deformations such as monopolies and oligopolies.
But monopolies of wealth are just as pernicious.
The State should not abandon its redistributive role; neither can the State surrender to the market its role in development.
Indeed, quality housing and schooling, pensions and unemployment insurance, a modern health system and family social services must not be the fruits of an established democracy but a condition for democracy’s consolidation and survival.
For any program based on selfishness and injustice must generate strong forces of social dissolution and instability.
The great challenge is to increase equality, and for this the State, which globalization claims to have overthrown, is vital.
Only it can establish progressive taxes, adequate regulation of privatized public services, support to small and medium size companies, more efficiency in the public spending and a significant improvement in the education and health systems.
It is the State’s undeniable obligation to guarantee the benefits of social security to all the inhabitants of a country.
Marxists used to agitate that the workers of the world unite.
They never did, but we are now seeing a globalization of solidarity, of support for cooperative regional patterns and the need to rethink international agencies, and the impracticality of isolation.
Without such solidarity, we are marching towards a world with no center, no authority, no order; a world ruled by a globalized Mafia “where what is official and what is clandestine will meet”.
The logic of power in that future world will be unforgiving toward those who give up on their will to self-determination.
To maintain that will, we must fight the fear of going against the prevailing political orthodoxy of an inevitable globalization.
The only fish that always swims with the current is a dead fish.

Is There a New Washington Consensus?
CAMBRIDGE – Two and a half years ago, senior staff members of the World Bank approached the Nobel laureate Michael Spence to ask him to lead a high-powered commission on economic growth.
The question at hand could not have been more important.
The “Washington consensus” – the infamous list of do’s and don’ts for policymakers in developing countries – had largely dissipated.
But what would replace it?
Spence was not sure he was the man for the job.
After all, his research had focused on theoretical issues in advanced economies; he had been dean of a business school; and he did not have much experience in economic development.
But he was intrigued by the task.
And he was encouraged by the enthusiastic and positive response he received from the commission’s prospective members.
Thus was born the Spence Commission on Growth and Development, a star-studded group of policymakers – including another Nobelist – whose final report was issued at the end of May.
The Spence report represents a watershed for development policy – as much for what it says as for what it leaves out.
Gone are confident assertions about the virtues of liberalization, deregulation, privatization, and free markets.
Also gone are the cookie cutter policy recommendations unaffected by contextual differences.
Instead, the Spence report adopts an approach that recognizes the limits of what we know, emphasizes pragmatism and gradualism, and encourages governments to be experimental.
Yes, successful economies have many things in common: they all engage in the global economy, maintain macroeconomic stability, stimulate saving and investment, provide market-oriented incentives, and are reasonably well governed.
It is useful to keep an eye on these commonalities, because they frame the conduct of appropriate economic policies.
Saying that context matters does not mean that anything goes.
But there is no universal rulebook; different countries achieve these ends differently.
The Spence report reflects a broader intellectual shift within the development profession, a shift that encompasses not just growth strategies but also health, education, and other social policies. The traditional policy framework, which the new thinking is gradually replacing, is presumptive rather than diagnostic .
It starts with strong preconceptions about the nature of the problem: too much (or too little) government regulation, too poor governance, too little public spending on health and education, and so on.
Moreover, its recommendations take the form of the proverbial “laundry list” of reforms, and emphasize their complementary nature – the imperative to undertake them all simultaneously – rather than their sequencing and prioritization.
And it is biased toward universal recipes – “model” institutional arrangements, “best practices,” rules of thumb, and so forth.
By contrast, the new policy mindset starts with relative agnosticism about what works.
Its hypothesis is that there is a great deal of “slack” in poor countries, so simple changes can make a big difference.
As a result, it is explicitly diagnostic and focuses on the most significant economic bottlenecks and constraints.
Rather than comprehensive reform, it emphasizes policy experimentation and relatively narrowly targeted initiatives in order to discover local solutions, and it calls for monitoring and evaluation in order to learn which experiments work.
The new approach is suspicious of universal remedies.
Instead, it searches for policy innovations that provide a shortcut around local economic or political complications.
This approach is greatly influenced by China’s experimental gradualism since 1978 – the most spectacular episode of economic growth and poverty reduction the world has ever seen.
The Spence report is a consensus document, and therefore an easy target for cheap shots.
It has no “big ideas” of its own, and at times it tries too hard to please everyone and cover all possible angles.
But, as Spence puts it with regard to economic reform itself, you need to take small steps in order to make a big difference in the long run.
It is quite a feat to have achieved the degree of consensus he has around a set of ideas that departs in places so markedly from the traditional approach.
It is to Spence’s credit that the report manages to avoid both market fundamentalism and institutional fundamentalism.
Rather than offering facile answers such as “just let markets work” or “just get governance right,” it rightly emphasizes that each country must devise its own mix of remedies.
Foreign economists and aid agencies can supply some of the ingredients, but only the country itself can provide the recipe.
If there is a new Washington consensus, it is that the rulebook must be written at home, not in Washington.
And that is real progress.

The Coming Productivity Revolution
NEW YORK – “Red warnings lights are once again flashing on the dashboard of the global economy,” British Prime Minister David Cameron declared after the G-20’s summit in November. He is right.
But the real worry is not the risk associated with near-term challenges, like Japan’s return to recession in 2014 or the eurozone’s enduring sluggishness; it is the gale-force headwinds that the entire world will face over the next half-century.
Despite nerve-wracking ups and downs, the last 50 years delivered an unprecedented global growth dividend.
Measured according to GDP (admittedly a flawed metric), the world economy expanded sixfold. Income per capita almost tripled.
In the developing world, sustained wealth creation and public-health advances have increased average life expectancy by 20 years since the mid-1970s, and adult illiteracy has been nearly halved in the last 30 years.
Inequality among countries has decreased, with more than one billion people lifted out of extreme poverty in the last two decades alone.
But if we pursue business as usual, the odds of making similarly impressive progress over the next 50 years are not very promising.
Since 1964, two key forces have fueled exceptionally fast GDP growth: the expansion of the labor supply, driven by rapid increases in population, and steady productivity gains.
According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the average annual GDP growth rate of 3.5% in the 19 member countries of the G-20 (not including the European Union) and Nigeria owes about 1.8 percentage points to labor and 1.7 points to productivity.
But, as fertility declines and populations age, the labor engine’s contribution to growth will fall sharply, to little more than 0.3 percentage points of annual growth.
Even if productivity continues to rise at the same rate, global GDP growth could slow to just over 2% annually, on average – a 40% drop from the last 50 years.
The good news is that this trajectory can be raised. But to do so requires a shift in focus from reducing inequality to delivering growth that benefits the poor and middle class as well.
The historian Ben Friedman has observed that the “central question” in US history is not “the poverty of the most disadvantaged” or “the success of the most privileged”; it is “the economic well-being of the broad majority” of the population.
The same is true on a global level, as billions of aspiring consumers rise up to join the middle class.
On the labor-market side, the most powerful lever to bolster the majority’s wellbeing would be to increase the employment of women, whose workforce-participation rate still lags behind that of men by as much as 40% globally.
Including more women presupposes better childcare and other social support in many countries, as well as further progress on pay equality, including the more equal taxation of second earners.
Moreover, MGI estimates that addressing barriers like mandatory retirement ages and perverse tax incentives could add about 200 million workers over the age of 65 to the world’s labor pool.
Efforts to reduce youth unemployment would also help.
These changes, while important, would have a limited impact, lifting labor’s contribution to future growth from one-fifth to only one-third of post-war levels.
What the world really needs to do is accelerate productivity – not at a modest pace, but at the economic equivalent of warp speed.
Fortunately, today’s private-sector labs are bursting with innovations that could spark major productivity-enhancing technological and operational improvements.
Advanced materials like nanolaminates (edible lipids) can, when sprayed on food, provide protection from air or moisture and reduce spoilage.
Carbon-fiber composites are making cars and airplanes both more resistant and lighter, reducing their fuel consumption.
And the “Internet of things” will rationalize production processes by detecting potential failures early, boost crop yields by measuring the moisture of fields, and dramatically reduce the cost of remotely monitoring patients’ health.
Just a little further out on the productivity frontier are commercially viable self-driving cars and trucks.
Likewise, synthetic biology will be possible before too long, with scientists using the huge amount of increasingly available and inexpensive genetic data to design DNA from scratch – a practice that has applications in medicine, agriculture, and even biofuel production.
But the private sector cannot realize this potential alone.
Most countries need increased public-sector investment to support essential long-term research and development, and smarter, more innovation-friendly regulation to facilitate future gains.
Because the biggest opportunities lie in spurring faster productivity catch-up by adopting and diffusing today’s best practices, politicians must keep pushing to reduce trade and regulatory barriers to market integration and competition.
Perhaps most important, labor markets must be made as flexible as possible, with well-trained workers secured by strong social-safety nets.
This would enable workers to weather the transition to the jobs of the future and allow the economy to benefit from new waves of wealth and value-generating creative destruction.
It is worth recalling that more than one-third of employment growth in the US since 1990 has come from jobs that did not exist, or barely existed, 25 years ago.
Some countries may even want to consider appointing a “growth czar” to connect all of these policy dots.
In the end, however, the actual growth figures are not the point.
What matters is ensuring that the wellbeing of as many citizens as possible is improving – and that requires concerted action by business leaders, governments, and civil society.

Lady Macbeth of Pyongyang
TOKYO – North Korea’s communist regime is, by most accounts, set to complete its second dynastic transfer of power, this time from Kim Jong-il, who has ruled since 1994, to his youngest son, Kim Jong-eun.
The general assembly of North Korea’s Workers’ Party, now underway for the first time in 44 years, is the clearest sign yet that “Dear Leader” Kim, who is seriously ill, is passing the crown in the hermit kingdom founded by his father, Kim Il-sung.
One reason why a dynastic succession is taking place is that Kim Il-sung created a national ideology, Juche, which mixes communism and autarky with a heavy dose of Confucian values.
Confucianism exalts an idealized bond between father and son as the model for all human relations, including between ruler and ruled.
So, just as a Confucian son’s absolute duty is to revere his father, the absolute duty of a Confucian subject is to revere the ruler.
Moreover, Kim Jong-il, like his father, has consistently appointed members of his family to positions of power.
Indeed, Kim Jong-eun, the third son of Kim Jong-il and his late consort Ko Young-hee, was mooted as his father’s successor almost a year ago.
North Korean propagandists proclaim Kim Jong-eun “the Young General,” but whether he will exercise the same absolutist authority as his father is an open question.
Not only is he young and inexperienced, but his aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, Kim Jong-il’s sister and the wife of the second-ranking figure in North Korea’s hierarchy, Chang Song-taek, may balk at power slipping through her fingers.
Although rarely seen or heard, Kim Kyong-hui, born on May 30, 1946 to Kim Il-sung and his first wife Kim Jong-suk, has served in a range of key Workers’ Party positions, including deputy director of the International Department and director of the Light Industry Department.
She became a member of the all-powerful Central Committee in 1988 – a post she retains to this day.
Kim Kyong-hui’s birth mother died when she was four.
After her father, Kim Il-sung, remarried, she was raised by various surrogates away from the family.
Observing the relationship between her father and stepmother, and their affection toward her half brothers, she is said to have become embittered and developed a fierce personality.
Indeed, Kim Jong-il is quoted as saying: “When my sister turns violent, no one can stop her.
Even I can do nothing.”
When Kim Jong-il started living with his second wife, Kim Kyong-hui sought to incite trouble, driven by a sense of rivalry.
After marrying Chang Song-taek, she began living something of a hedonistic life herself, but she scrutinized her husband’s conduct minutely, flying into a jealous rage over the slightest signs of infidelity.
Kim Jong-il has described his sister as “my only blood family whom I was asked to take care of by my mother till the moment she died.”
Their mother, Kim Jong-suk, is said to have died from hemorrhaging while giving premature birth caused by her distress over Kim Il-sung’s love affair with Kim Song-ae.
Kim Il-sung reportedly rushed to the hospital, but the door to her room was locked.
When she died, her doctor and Kim Jong-il were the only people present.
But Chan Giryok, who was Kim Jong-suk’s primary doctor and is now a doctor at Nagoya University in Japan, tells a different story.
According to Chan, Kim Jong-suk was at Kim Il-sung’s Pyongyang home near the Soviet Embassy, quarreling with him.
Watching from afar, the doctor saw Kim Il-sung holding a pistol.
The doctor, who was a surgeon, not an obstetrician, questioned the wisdom of summoning him to treat excessive bleeding from a premature delivery.
He believes that he was summoned to treat bleeding caused by something else.
Kim Jong-il, who is known to have had a powerful attachment to his birth mother, cannot help but have been psychologically affected by witnessing his mother’s killing.
From the moment of his mother’s death, he kept his young sister close to him at all times.
Indeed, in a country where trust rarely exists, Kim Kyong-hui is the only blood relation whom Kim Jong-il has ever fully trusted.
Moreover, the two share the same lineage of the Great Leader, or Suryong,linked to Kim Jong-suk on the maternal side, and are fully devoted to the absolute supremacy of the Suryong and hereditary succession.
Speaking before the Central Committee after Kim Il-sung’s death, Kim Jong-il said, “Kim Kyong-hui is myself, the words of Kim Kyong-hui are my words, and instructions issued by Kim Kyong-hui are my instructions.”
Kim Kyong-hui’s intent to exercise power after her brother’s passing is supported by rumors that she helped arrange a traffic accident in June that killed Ri Je-gang, a senior party official and perceived guardian of Kim Jong-eun who reportedly attempted to oust Kim Kyong-hui and her close allies from power.
Whether true or not, such rumors indicate the magnitude of her influence.
There is, indeed, a growing belief that Kim Jong-il might, at any moment, designate Kim Kyong-hui to serve as a caretaker for the third-generation successor after his death. But Kim Kyong-hui may have other plans, such as becoming Kim Jong-il’s successor herself.
The threat from North Korea has always been that it might start another war, whether by miscalculation or design. But, even if the “Young General” or his aunt turn out not to be unhinged megalomaniacs, the looming changeover opens a new era of uncertainty, particularly given North Korea’s economic woes.
Whether Kim Jong-eun or Kim Kyong-hui intend to soldier on in desperate isolation, or to bring in economic change, they lack the revolutionary credentials and grip on power needed to do so.
So when Kim Jong-il passes from the scene, and political instability meets economic blight, the regime could fall apart.
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has wisely begun to prepare for that contingency by proposing a special “Unification Tax” to help pay the costs of the Kim dynasty’s eventual disintegration.
Japan and the rest of Asia should prepare for that day as well.

China’s Show Trial of the Century
LONDON – The trial, conviction, and suspended death sentence of Gu Kailai, the wife of purged Chinese leader Bo Xilai, has called into question not only China’s legal system, but the very unity of the Communist Party leadership.
Let us begin with the many questions raised at the trial.
For starters, Gu claimed that she killed the British businessman Neil Heywood only to protect her son.
But, given Gu’s power as Bo’s wife, she could have had someone like Heywood jailed or expelled from China at the snap of her fingers.
No need for cyanide.
Still, she not only admitted her guilt, but seemed to embrace it as a sort of historical necessity.
“In order to uphold the sanctity of the law,” she told the court, “I am willing to accept and calmly face whatever judgment I am given, and I also expect a fair and just judgment.”
Not since Stalin’s show trials of the 1930’s has a defendant so effusively praised a judge who seemed bound to condemn her at a trial where no witness or evidence against her was presented.
The bitter irony of Gu’s high-speed trial is that she was a true believer in China’s legal system.
Indeed, following a victory in an American court, Gu, a lawyer, wrote a book in which she claimed that China provides “the fairest method of trial.”
She continued, “Chinese lawyers would not quibble over the meaning of each little word.
Once they are sure that you murdered someone, you will be arrested, judged, and executed by firing squad.”
Indeed, Gu was an avatar of the Maoist form of legality that China has maintained long after Mao’s death.
Having failed the entrance examination to Peking University, Gu was nonetheless granted an exception and admitted to read law soon after the Communist Party restored the law departments.
Prior to that, she sold pork in a Beijing market, where she earned the nicknamed, “Yi dao zhun,” meaning that she could hack off a desired slice of meat with one blow.
Gu was one of the first lawyers to receive her license.
But, with the Tiananmen Square incident of 1989, the authorities clamped down on the profession’s autonomy.
The Party reasserted control over every aspect of justice through a core department: the Communist Party Central Committee’s Political and Legal Affairs Committee (PLAC).
This totalitarian organ has no known address, yet it manages China’s police, prosecutors, courts, and justice ministry, and appoints their leadership.
All lawyers fall under its remit.
Most important, all local PLAC secretaries simultaneously lead the local public-security bureau.
Small wonder, then, that the artist Ai Weiwei could be detained in secret, Liu Xiaobo could be sentenced to 11 years in prison for starting a petition, and Li Wangya could “commit suicide” while in custody.
But even this monolithic system of control is porous.
Had Wang Lijun, the former Chongqing police commissioner and close ally of Bo Xilai, not feared for his life and fled to the United States’ consulate in Chengdu, Gu would still be helping Bo to rule the city.
Wang is no saint.
Before he became Bo’s police commissioner, he was the director of the Field Psychology Research Center, where the condemned were executed and their live organs removed.
Wang’s paper, “A Study of Organ and Receptor Transplantation after Execution by Injection,” earned him the Guanghua Innovation Contribution Award.
In the paper, he credits “our achievements” to the “thousands of transplantations.”
Given his familiarity with the brutality of the Chinese system, Wang no doubt understood that, after falling out with Gu and Bo, the US consulate might be the only place he could find safety.
After all, when it came to the public-security organs, the courts, and the prison system, Gu always had the final say.
She acted as her husband’s adviser for cracking down on crime and corruption, and was responsible for sending two people – including the PLAC secretary in Wushan County – to prison.
In fact, a few days after killing Heywood, Gu donned a major general’s uniform (which could have belonged to her father, General Gu Jingsheng), convened police officers in Chongqing, and falsely claimed that she had received a secret order from the Ministry of Public Security to protect Wang’s personal safety.
The uniform, perhaps, was intended to intimidate the Chongqing police.
But, in a strange and unexplained twist, Wang was whisked from the consulate to Beijing, where he presented the Party leadership with the evidence that brought about Bo’s downfall and Gu’s arrest.
But revealing the skeletons in Bo’s closet also meant revealing the secret world of the “red aristocracy.”
So Wang can expect no leniency at his trial, which will most likely end with a commuted death sentence and forced labor.
In order to protect the red aristocracy, the PLAC made no mention during Gu’s trial of her myriad economic crimes.
So, in the PLAC’s rewrite of history, Heywood was murdered so that Gu could protect her son, Bo Guagua.
And Wang did not defend China’s honor by revealing Bo’s and Gu’s criminality, but aired his stories to hostile foreign forces.
Only through his punishment can popular indignation be contained.
But the Bo Xilai and Gu Kalai affair may only be a prologue, because the only clear truth to emerge from it is that the Party leadership is fractured.
The wolves are now turning on each other.

A Prisoner’s Reflections on Nelson Mandela
KHARKIV – Incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability. But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite.
As a prisoner, I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself, my political beliefs, and my country.
So I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men, old and young, who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future.
In prison, your hopes and dreams become your reality.
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed.
The South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades, but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality, courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence.
Around the world, most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness.
Even here, behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long, I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile, merry eyes, and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache.
And I can admire his unyielding – and, yes, sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation, which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable.
How wrong they were, and how miraculous was Mandela’s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa.
But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination.
“My” Mandela is the prisoner, the Mandela of Robben Island, who endured 27 years behind bars (18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic) and yet emerged with his spirit intact, brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa, a country liberated even for apartheid’s architects and beneficiaries.
No purges marked the end of white rule.
There were no witch-hunts, nor was there summary justice.
All that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed.
Through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country’s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess.
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom, because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison.
Indeed, he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture.
Imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well.
“Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties, either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts,” he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago.
“This line shifts….And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains...an un-uprooted small corner of evil.”
The ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow.
Forced to reckon with your own vulnerability, isolation, and losses (and seemingly lost cause), you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers.
Mandela epitomized this rare gift.
How else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa’s first democratically elected president?
Of course, behind Mandela’s generous spirit was a character of steel. He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause.
And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family. And yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people.
As usual, Mandela’s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this: “As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.”
And just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall, I know in my solitude that Ukraine’s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain.

A Peace of Water
PRAGUE – The global financial crisis may be grabbing all the headlines, but resolving it should not be allowed to crowd out other vital issues.
In the Middle East, for example, Israelis and Palestinians – as well as many others around the world – are beginning to believe that the permanent status negotiations to determine the future of Palestine are going nowhere.
The situation may be more promising than it appears, but one cannot deny that hope for real changes on the ground has faded since talks were re-launched two years ago.
This loss of faith is, sadly, establishing a dynamic that will itself inhibit the concessions that are needed if a permanent agreement is to be found.
Because an impasse beckons, it is vitally important to work on those areas where intensive negotiations have the potential to produce quick results.
Fresh water is one such area.
Across the Middle East, water is a security issue.
Indeed, people are now recognizing two important facts.
First, nations faced with conflicting claims to water have historically found ways to collaborate rather than to fight.
Even during the 60 years of conflict in the Jordan Valley, water has more often been a source of cooperation than of conflict.
Second, water scarcity is seldom absolute, and even less often an explanation of poverty.
To quote the United Nations Human Development Report for 2006: “There is more than enough water in the world for domestic purposes, for agriculture and for industry….Scarcity is manufactured through political processes and institutions that disadvantage the poor.”
But almost every nation in the Middle East is using more water than arrives on a renewable basis.
There simply is not enough water for everything these nations want to use it for, and the situation will only worsen.
Yet, even in Palestine, the key water issue is not thirst, but arrested economic development.
In the short term, Palestine needs more water to provide employment and income from farming; in the longer term, educational, cultural, and political changes are needed in order to develop a capacity to adapt.
The region’s climate and geography mean that water resources are unavoidably shared.
But only if water is shared in a rational manner that respects the region’s fragile ecology will human life be sustainable.
Clearly, no final agreement on water will be possible until there are agreed-upon borders between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, and some resolution of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
But interim resolution of water issues does not need to wait for final resolution of the major issues.
Finding rational ways to share and co-manage water may be easier than solving the “big” issues.
In fact, water could help to create a climate of success that aids progress in other areas.
The good news is that the quantity of water that is needed for drinking, cooking, other household chores and sanitation is small.
Most water is used to grow food, so, if a nation’s economy is healthy, there is scope for saving water by importing a greater share of food, although every nation will want to maintain some assured food supply for security reasons.
The bad news is that water, unlike land, cannot simply be divided.
Water flows on the surface and underground.
As it moves, it changes in quantity and quality, and it supports different ecosystems.
Moreover, demand for water changes over time.
Only a few percentage points of the Israeli GNP come from agriculture today; as a result, its economy requires less water than it once did.
Exactly the same transition is likely to occur in Palestine, but it has not happened yet.
Few Israelis deny that Palestinians need more water.
Similarly, there is wide agreement that some water currently used by Israelis will have to be allocated to Palestinian use.
The current negotiations will inevitably deal with rights to water, which do not seem to be very contentious anymore, and the talks can suggest various mechanisms for transfer of management in some cases and for shared management in others.
These are eminently negotiable issues.
A flexible and sustainable formula can certainly be found, almost surely including a transitional period that allows both sides to adjust to and account for their different water management systems, as well as for changing conditions and institutions in the future.
The principle of a just division of water resources to meet the Palestinians’ urgent needs for additional water should be taken as a starting point.
Everything else can be worked out.
Shared water calls for flexible, continuous, cooperative water management, based on agreed-upon rights and responsibilities, as well as ongoing monitoring and dispute resolution mechanisms.
One important point should be added: extensive public participation and transparency, in terms of both process and outcomes, will be key to successful management.
We believe that progress in the peace process and in finding solutions for water issues between Israel and Palestine would also help to unblock progress in the broader region, between the parties on the Jordan, the Orontes, the Tigris, and the Euphrates rivers.
Water can be a catalyst for regional cooperation, opening the way to a future comprehensive “Community of Water and Energy” to enhance the human environment.
In such a forum, water and solar energy in tandem could help to move the Middle East from conflict to collaboration.
The cost of inaction or merely pretending to act is likely to be high for everyone in the Middle East.
Future water policy should no longer be seen as an extension of current policy, but rather as a new opportunity.
Water is the essence of life.
People in Palestine and in Israel need it; people in the region need it.
Cooperating to secure it is the only way forward.

Turning the Page on Ebola
WASHINGTON, DC – The Ebola outbreak that began last year in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, three of the four countries of the Mano River Union, is the most severe on record since the disease was first diagnosed in Central Africa in 1976.
The impact of the epidemic has been devastating, calling into question our three countries’ significant socioeconomic progress in the aftermath of decades of conflict and instability.
The region has so far registered a total of 25,791 cases and 10,689 deaths – almost ten times the number of deaths from all other Ebola epidemics combined.
For 2014, the projected growth rates for our three countries were 4.5%-11.3%.
These projections have now been reduced to 2.2% at best.
In the absence of mitigation measures, a recession cannot be ruled out.
The uncontrolled spread of the disease exposed the shortcomings of our national health care systems, as well as regional and global institutions’ weak capacity for coordination and effective response.
Simply put, we were ill prepared to cope with, much less prevent, an outbreak on this scale.
We bear a collective responsibility for the thousands of lives lost to Ebola and the tens of thousands affected by the disease. And, today, thanks to institutional improvement and adaptation, we are closer to winning the fight against Ebola.
Although the disease has not been contained and eradicated throughout the region, its spread has slowed; now we have to start planning our recovery, which must include strengthening the national, regional, and international systems that protect our people’s lives and futures.
We, the presidents of the three affected countries, met in Conakry, Guinea, in February, joined by Côte d’Ivoire, to adopt a common strategy to end the epidemic and guide post-Ebola socioeconomic recovery.
This meeting was followed by a donors meeting in Brussels at the beginning of March, and a meeting in Freetown, Sierra Leone, two weeks later to coordinate our technical committees.
We will continue to build on these efforts in Washington, DC, at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
We are determined to eradicate Ebola by exchanging information, sharing technical expertise, creating innovative and accessible community health systems, and intensifying public education strategies, including steps that can be shared in families, such as applied water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) standards.
Only then can investment by the private sector – the engine of employment and stable livelihoods – begin to recover.
The spread of the Ebola virus has been facilitated by our countries’ shared history and culture, which has enabled the disease to cross borders easily and move quickly from remote rural areas to urban centers.
Unfortunately, the epidemic forced us to close some of our borders, preventing access to relatives and care.
We want our infrastructure, health policies, and economic strengths to benefit people across borders through links – community support systems and development corridors – that encourage collaboration and job creation. And we ask our international partners to support a common economic stimulus plan, with an emphasis on practical solutions that can enhance growth and increase employment.
Four elements are essential to our recovery effort.
The first component is the creation of resilient public health systems, which requires trained community health workers in order to expand coverage in rural areas.
It also requires nationwide water and sanitation programs and well-equipped centers for the control of infectious diseases in each country.
Second, we need to focus on infrastructure, particularly roads and electricity and telecommunication networks.
We ask the African Development Bank to take the initiative in creating an infrastructure fund, an extension of the Mano River Initiative, launched in 2013, with the objective of furthering regional integration.
And we ask our partners to recognize that programs originally planned on a ten-year time horizon, must be implemented urgently.
Third, we need to support economic recovery by encouraging confidence within the private sector, which has been hit by rising costs in the region.
Specifically, the region would benefit from grants to local entrepreneurs, concessional financing and loans to foreign investors, and budgetary support from the government.
Finally, in line with the recommendation of the Commission for Africa, the United Nations, and the African Union, we ask for a total cancellation of our foreign debt. This would allow us to recover the fiscal flexibility we need to enable us to co-finance the reconstruction of our health systems.
We urge our international partners to support our economic recovery in the same spirit of cooperation, and with the same sense of urgency, that helped us fight the Ebola virus.
Together, we can build health care systems, infrastructure, and regional institutions that will be stronger than before the start of the epidemic.
Together, we can build a lasting legacy of health and progress for our peoples.

Stimulating Brazil’s Bioeconomy
SÃO PAULO – In the midst of the growing climate crisis, the world can no longer rely solely on old models of economic development.
In this context, the concept of a bioeconomy – activities that produce relatively little carbon, using high-value-added processes – is gaining increasing prominence.
But governments and civil-society actors face differing institutional and economic obstacles on the path to a true bioeconomy.
Given historical and current global energy-consumption trends, some European and North American countries have taken seriously the goal of developing renewable energy sources.
On the other hand, some countries in the Global South, where agriculture represents the main source of greenhouse-gas emissions and biodiversity loss, face the challenge of establishing a bioeconomy based on new agricultural models.
In this regard, Brazil has a central part to play in mitigating the effects of climate change, in particular by conserving the rich biodiversity contained in the six vast biomes spanning its territory.
These include the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing global rainfall cycles and producing oxygen, among other benefits.
With the rate of deforestation in the Amazon reaching alarming levels in 2019, as well as during the current COVID-19 pandemic, a major systemic risk to the global climate balance is becoming clear.
To understand the history of Brazil’s agrarian development and the country’s prospects of establishing a sustainable twenty-first-century agriculture system, one must comprehend the state’s role in institutionalizing norms, rules, and protocols that contribute to the growth and decline of agricultural value chains.
For example, the soybean and cattle industries that have expanded across large parts of the Amazon and the Cerrado (another important Brazilian biome) since the mid-twentieth century benefited directly from tax incentives, fertilizer subsidies, access to credit, and research support for large-scale grain and beef production.
Unfortunately, government policies continue providing incentives for environmentally predatory agricultural value chains today, and the current Brazilian government’s increasingly reckless environmental policies make it likely that deforestation of protected areas will increase in the coming years.
University researchers and nongovernmental organizations have established that the rapid rate of deforestation in the Amazon in recent decades is mainly the result of speculators seizing control of vast public lands.
With forged documents and the assistance of corrupt officials, these land-grabbers are able to claim ownership of these assets and sell them at a huge profit later.
In 2019, nearly 176 million hectares of private property were created on such land.
Clearly, establishing a new model of agriculture and rural production will require strict state control over protected areas and prevention of illegal occupation of public land.
But better mechanisms to control and punish illegal activities in protected and public areas will not be enough to stimulate the economic use of biomes and their assets, as set out in Brazil’s 2009 National Plan for the Promotion of Socio-Biodiversity Value Chains.
It is also necessary to create and promote the legal terms, incentives, protocols, and commercial and technological partnerships to support both business capital and community-based ventures associated with the bioeconomy.
If capitalism is based on expectations, then the desired expansion of the bioeconomy depends on the existence of a wide range of functioning institutions, capable of supporting expectations of high returns among the different agents interested in Brazilian biodiversity value chains.
Value creation for forests and other biological assets includes activating fair-trade protocols between private firms and community-based enterprises; facilitating access to information about important agrarian policies such as minimum-price guarantees for biodiversity products; forging a better legal apparatus for rural cooperatives; and developing technological innovations appropriate for traditional communities’ productive and socio-cultural context.
Other priorities include reducing red tape in the extension of rural credit to producers of biodiverse assets such as Brazil nuts, baru, and copaiba: whereas soy producers in the state of Pará (one of the largest in the Amazon) received over R$6.5 million ($1.2 million) in 2018-19 from the public credit line for family farming, producers of Brazil nuts received only about R$260,000.
To boost economic returns and generate income, it is essential for community-based ventures to have better access to credit and microcredit.
Building a durable Brazilian bioeconomy will require strategic links among community-based enterprises, investors, companies, and technology developers, embedded in robust, functioning institutions.
The significant financial and human-capital investments needed to create sustainable value chains will materialize only when the current uncertainty regarding their future economic viability is replaced by positive expectations.
By establishing a firm institutional foundation of “virtuous incentives,” therefore, Brazil can offer the world an innovative new agricultural model to help tackle climate change.

Why Aren’t All Girls in School?
PARIS – At the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, participants promised to advance the rights of women and girls everywhere.
Part of that promise, set out in the historic Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, was to ensure education for all girls.
A recent study by UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report examines whether the promise has been kept.
A quarter-century after the conference and coming just after the International Day of the Girl Child on October 11, the good news is that 180 million more girls are enrolled in primary and secondary school than in 1995, and that more girls than ever are staying in school and graduating.
There is good news in tertiary education as well: three times more women are studying at university in this generation than the last.
In Morocco, for example, just 30 women were enrolled for every 100 men in the early 1990s; today there is parity.
Outcomes matter as much as access.
Here, there has been significant progress.
In more than 50% of middle- and high-income countries, girls perform just as well as boys in mathematics, and outperform them in 25% of these countries.
But the poorest girls are still left behind.
Of the 59 million primary-school-age children around the world who were not attending school in 2018, 12 million – 75% of them girls – had never set foot in a classroom and were unlikely ever to do so.
In over 20 countries, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa, hardly any poor rural girls will graduate from upper secondary school.
For the most marginalized, schools are still unsafe environments where verbal and sexual harassment, abuse, and violence prevail.
In many places, high pregnancy rates very often keep girls out of school, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
While the prevalence of early pregnancy fell by one-third among girls aged 15-19 between 1995 and 2020, early pregnancy rates remain high – especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where one-quarter of 18-year-old girls are already mothers.
It is also essential that comprehensive sexuality education is introduced in all schools.
This type of counseling not only helps students resist peer pressure to engage in or accept violence, but also leads to a reduction in early pregnancies.
There has been some promising progress in the last few years, such as Sierra Leone’s decision in March to overturn a ban on pregnant girls’ school attendance.
But two countries still enforce a ban on pregnant girls and young mothers in education: Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania.
Other barriers are less serious but hold girls back as well.
Consider Rabia Nusrat, who wanted to study engineering ever since she was a child in Pakistan.
Despite her parents urging her to select a less male-dominated subject, she insisted and now is the first in her family and community to complete a degree in engineering in Pakistan.
But not all girls are equally persistent, and the reality is that not enough teachers and career counselors have the training to help correct the gender imbalance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
In OECD countries, only 14% of the top-performing girls in science or mathematics are expected to work in science and engineering, compared to 26% of top-performing boys.
School textbooks also perpetuate gender norms that hold girls back.
Often, the text and images portray women in traditional homebound roles and less prestigious occupations, while men are depicted as powerful leaders.
Such archaic stereotypes have no place in contemporary teaching materials and should be removed.
The UNESCO report also highlights the importance of having more women in leadership positions in the teaching sector.
Teaching is a feminized profession, which perpetuates gender-unequal norms regarding labor-market opportunities.
Still, the glass ceiling is a reality even here.
In 48 middle- and high-income countries, there is a gender gap of 20 percentage points between teachers and head teachers in lower secondary schools.
Female leadership does not automatically translate into improvements for girls, but female leaders can change social and gender norms through legislation and policies, and by acting as visible role models for girls.
Next year, the world’s governments will sign a new declaration on the rights of a new generation of women at the Generation Equality Forum.
Education deserves a central position in this new declaration, because girls continue to be more likely to face the worst forms of exclusion – especially as COVID-19 threatens to push inequalities to extremes.
It is important to celebrate the progress that has been made so far.
But we also need to remember how much remains to be done in order to achieve true gender equality in and through education.

A World of Convergence
WASHINGTON, DC – For almost two centuries, starting around 1800, the history of the global economy was broadly one of divergence in average incomes.
In relative terms, rich countries got even richer.
There was growth in the poorer countries, too, but it was slower than rich-country growth, and the discrepancy in prosperity between rich and poor countries increased.
This “divergence” was very pronounced in colonial times.
It slowed after the 1940’s, but it was only around 1990 that an entirely new trend could be observed – convergence between average incomes in the group of rich countries and the rest of the world.
From 1990 to 2010, average per capita income in the emerging and developing countries grew almost three times as fast as average income in Europe, North America, and Japan, compared to lower or, at most, equal growth rates for almost two centuries.
This has been a revolutionary change, but will this 20-year-old trend continue?
Will convergence remain rapid, or will it be a passing phase in world economic history?
Long-term projections based on short-term trends have often been mistaken.
In the late 1950’s, after the Soviet Union launched the first spacecraft, eminent Western economists predicted that Soviet income would overtake that of the United States in a few decades.
After all, the Soviet Union was investing close to 40% of its GDP, twice the ratio in the West.
Later, in the 1980’s, Japan’s spectacular growth led some to predict that it would overtake the US, not only in per capita terms, but even in terms of some measures of “economic power.”
These kinds of projections have often been based on simple extrapolations of exponential trends.
Over two or three decades, substantial differences in compound growth rates quickly generate huge changes in economic size or per capita income.
Will the recent predictions of rapid ongoing global convergence similarly turn out to be wrong, or will most of the emerging countries sustain a large positive growth differential and get much closer to the advanced economies’ income levels?
Understanding the phenomenon of “catch-up” growth is key to answering this question.
Trade and foreign direct investment have made it much easier for emerging countries to absorb and adapt best-practice technology invented in the advanced economies.
The information revolution, allowing much easier access to and diffusion of knowledge, has accelerated the process.
Once they developed the basic institutions needed for a market economy and learned how to avoid serious macroeconomic policy mistakes, emerging countries started benefiting from catch-up growth.
Those with very high investment rates, mostly in East Asia, grew faster than those with lower investment rates; but, overall, catch-up growth probably has been adding 2-4 percentage points to many emerging and developing countries’ annual growth rates.
At the same time, population growth decreased, adding at least another point to the pace of per capita growth.
This process will likely continue for another decade or two, depending on where in the process particular countries are.
It is true that catch-up growth is easier in manufacturing than in other sectors, a point recently emphasized by Dani Rodrik of Harvard University, and it may be that a good portion of it has been exhausted in manufacturing by the best-performing firms in emerging countries.
But there is still a lot of “internal” room for catch-up growth, as less efficient domestic firms become more competitive with more efficient ones.
The dispersion of “total factor productivity” – the joint productivity of capital and labor – inside emerging countries has been found to be large.
Moreover, sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, and trade also have catch-up-growth potential, through imports of technology, institutional know-how, and organizational models.
Of course, temporary disturbances, a worsening of global payments imbalances, or macroeconomic policy mistakes, including those made in advanced economies and affecting the entire world economy, could undermine global growth.
But the underlying “convergence differential,” owing to catch-up growth, is likely to continue to reduce the income gap between the old advanced economies and emerging-market countries.
The Soviet Union never was able to build the institutions to allow for catch-up economic growth.
Japan slowed down after it had basically caught up.
China, India, Brazil, Turkey, and others may have firms operating close to the world’s technological frontier, but they still have a lot of unused catch-up potential.
The more that these countries can invest while ensuring macroeconomic stability and balance-of-payments sustainability, the faster they can adopt better technology and production processes.
In that case, they can continue to catch up, at least for the next decade or more.
The convergence process is going to slow, but not yet.

François Hollande’s Wrong Idea of France
LONDON – France’s new president, François Hollande, has achieved a remarkable series of political victories – at home and in Europe – since his election in May.
Unfortunately, his streak of success will inevitably call forth an economic reckoning that will shock France’s apparently unsuspecting citizens and doom the French elite’s approach to the “construction of Europe.”
Since winning the presidency, Hollande has won a parliamentary majority and pushed Germany toward accepting joint liability for eurozone countries’ debts.
But forebodings of crisis have become widespread in French business and economic circles.
But the real danger – which even Hollande’s sternest critics may be underestimating – is not so much his individual policy failings (serious though they may be) as his approach to the twin challenges posed by France’s economic imbalances and the eurozone crisis.
On each front separately, he might manage to muddle through; together, they look likely to cement France’s loss of competitiveness.
Declining competitiveness is best captured in a single indicator: unit labor costs, which measure the average cost of labor per unit of output.
In a monetary union, discrepancies in wage growth relative to productivity gains – that is, unit labor costs – will result in a chronic accumulation of trade surpluses or deficits.
Since the euro’s introduction, unit labor costs have risen dramatically faster in France than they have in Germany.
According to Eurostat data published in April 2011, the hourly labor cost in France was €34.2, compared to €30.1 in Germany – and nearly 20% higher than the eurozone average of €27.6.
France’s current-account deficit has risen to more than 2% of GDP, even as its economic growth has ground to a halt.
The high cost of employing workers in France is due not so much to wages and benefits as it is to payroll taxes levied on employers.
The entire French political class has long delighted in taxing labor to finance the country’s generous welfare provisions, thus avoiding excessively high taxation of individuals’ income and consumption – though that is about to come to an end as Hollande intends to slap a 75% tax on incomes above €1 million.
This is a version of the fallacy that taxing companies (“capital”) spares ordinary people (“workers”).
Of course, such taxes on firms are always passed on to households – usually through straightforward price hikes, and, in France, also through unemployment.
High tax rates on labor – together with rigid regulation of hiring and firing – make employers extremely reluctant to recruit workers.
As a result, France has had chronic long-term unemployment – forecast to reach 10.5% by 2013 – for many years.
Hollande’s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, tried to address this problem.
He exempted voluntary overtime pay from employment tax and shifted some of the burden of labor taxation onto consumption (via a hike in VAT).
But Hollande quickly reversed both of these reforms.
The repeal of the tax break on overtime reflects another economic fallacy to which French Socialist politicians are deeply attached: the “lump of labor” notion that underlay the most disastrous of their economic policies – the 35-hour workweek, introduced in 2000.
The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant, and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment.
Such measures, designed to create jobs by freeing up work hours, are futile at best, and are often detrimental.
French Socialists should recall their school physics lesson about communicating vessels: when a homogeneous liquid is poured into a set of connected containers, it settles at the same level in all of them, regardless of their shape and volume.
Generating more “liquid” (jobs) requires not discouraging the entrepreneurs on whose activities sustainable job creation ultimately depends.
The effect of fiscal and regulatory pressure on employment is to encourage French firms to invest and hire outside France.
Hollande’s apologists praise his gradualist and consensual approach to addressing the economy’s structural distortions.
They argue that his penchant for setting up consultative commissions is the best way to forge the consensus required for structural reform, whereas Sarkozy’s combative style was counterproductive.
Even banishing skepticism and assuming that Hollande could over time persuade his supporters to embrace competitiveness-boosting policies, the eurozone crisis is denying France the time that such gradualism requires.
A simple, effective way to buy time would be to abandon the euro and restore competitiveness through a devalued national currency.
But this expedient is incompatible with mainstream French politicians’ devotion to the “European project,” which amounts to a projection of French soft power; indeed, building Europe lies at the heart of the French establishment’s version of what Charles de Gaulle used to call “a certain idea of France.”
For mainstream French politicians, renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative: an all-out push for full European political union.
This would reestablish monetary sovereignty and create a normal central bank (like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England) at the European level.
But it would also mean abandoning France’s republic in favor of a federal European government – anathema to that “certain idea of France.”
The combination of gradualism (on the most generous interpretation) in domestic economic reform and the paralyzing effect of the eurozone crisis will lead to a massive shock.
Remaining in a currency union with the much more competitive German economy will require wrenching and rapid reforms, for which Hollande’s tepid approach will fail to prepare the complacent French.
The result will be even more support than was seen in last April’s presidential election for extremist political parties that reject both Europe and competitive market capitalism.

The Middle East Crack-Up
JERUSALEM – The horror stories emerging from northern Iraq, as well as the continuing slaughter in Syria’s civil war, point to a tectonic shift in the Middle East.
Almost 100 years after World War I, the regional state system established after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire is unraveling.
The contemporary map of the Middle East was drawn by the victorious Western imperial powers, Great Britain and France, during and after WWI.
While the war was still raging, they signed an agreement drafted by the diplomats Sir Mark Sykes and François George-Picot, which delineated their respective spheres of influence across the Levant – an agreement that entirely disregarded the region’s history, ethnic and religious traditions and affiliations, and the will of local populations.
The modern states of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon thus arose as separate, independent entities.
Their borders were arbitrary and artificial, and none had ever existed in such form.
(The case of Palestine was even more complicated, owing to Britain’s conflicting promises to Arabs and Jews.)
Eventually, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon became independent countries, modeled on the Westphalian idea of the modern nation-state.
Their leaders maintained this system – and its borders – as the best available.
None of these rulers, especially the authoritarian ones who emerged after independence, had an interest in rocking the boat.
That Western-imposed system is now unraveling.
Nation-states cannot be sustained when they do not reflect the wishes of their populations.
The United States-led invasion of Iraq put an end not only to Saddam Hussein’s rule, but also to Sunni-minority control, established by the British generations ago.
The Shia majority, once unleashed, viewed US-backed democratic elections as a vehicle for imposing hegemonic control over the country.
Iraq today is not the unitary Arab nation-state that it was, and it is doubtful whether that state can be restored.
The Kurdish Regional Government in the north is a de facto state, with its own army, border authorities, and control (up to a point) of the natural resources located on its territory.
Foreign consulates in the KRG’s capital, Erbil, effectively function as embassies.
In Syria, what started as peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations deteriorated quickly into an armed insurrection of the Sunni majority against the hegemony of the Alawite sect, led by the Assad family.
As with Iraq, it is difficult to see how Syria can be reconstituted as a unitary Arab nation-state.
The de facto dismemberment of both countries’ central state authorities gave rise to a totally new player – the Islamic State, which has announced the establishment of a caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria, totally disregarding the old Sykes-Picot arrangement.
The Islamic State, an offshoot of Al Qaeda, probably will not succeed in creating a viable, cross-border entity, but its brutal effort and Islamist ideology certainly suggest that the old borders, and the states delineated by them, are on their way out.
Indeed, the group’s recent incursions into Lebanon may also undermine the fragile inter-communal balance there.
The unraveling of the Western-imposed state system is taking place elsewhere in the greater Middle East.
Sudan – a vast, multiethnic, and multi-confessional country, established as a political entity by the British in the 1890s – is continuing to fray.
The emergence, after a prolonged and bloody civil war, of an independent South Sudan in 2011, freed the local Christian and animist population from the Arab/Muslim yoke. But Darfur is still bleeding, and South Sudan is far from being a stable polity.
Libya, too, is disintegrating.
The two provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, which Italy wrested from the Ottomans just before WWI, were forced together into an entity called “Libya,” despite their profound historical and cultural differences.
Since Muammar el-Qaddafi’s demise in 2011, Libyans have failed to establish a coherent state structure of any sort, cycling through six prime ministers.
Pious Western sermons about the need to form a unified, democratically elected government sound utterly irrelevant, given the extent of social and political fragmentation.
There is one exception to this regional development: Egypt.
For all of its internal tribulations, there is no doubt that Egypt is a coherent entity, deeply anchored in history and in the consciousness of its population.
For all of the problems confronting the Coptic Christian community, no one doubts that they are as Egyptian as the Muslim majority.
But Egypt, too, has followed a defining regional pattern.
Whereas secularism in the West arose with the emergence of liberal and democratic forces inspired by the Enlightenment, in the Muslim Middle East it has always been imposed by authoritarian rulers: the Shah in Iran, Atatürk in Turkey, Saddam in Iraq, Assad in Syria, and Nasser and Mubarak in Egypt.
This explains why Syria’s Christian and Druze minorities now support Assad, and why the Copts in Egypt support military rule: democratic majoritarian rule means Muslim hegemony.
Europe endured centuries of violent religious and national struggle, culminating in the horrors of the two world wars, before achieving its current stable state system.
The Middle East probably will pay less in terms of time and violence; but the idea that what emerges will necessarily be European-style nation-states may turn out to be a Western conceit.
The late literary theorist and public intellectual Edward Said might even have called it an example of paternalistic Orientalism.

The Mis-Measure of Development
BERMUDA – A new scorecard that purports to grade countries on development progress tells us little about how we are faring against humanity’s biggest challenges.
Instead, it highlights the shortcomings of today’s unfocused global development agenda.
The major new report, led by Jeffrey D. Sachs and issued by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Germany’s Bertelsmann Stiftung, provides a color-coded dashboard to demonstrate how well every country is doing at implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – the hugely important agenda that succeeded the highly effective Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 18 months ago.
Green indicates success across all indicators of a goal; yellow, orange, and red point to increasing distances from achieving the goal.
You might expect to discover from the rating how well rich countries are allocating their development aid, and how successfully poorer countries are spending their own funds, to make sure more people have access to education, healthcare, food security, and a safe, clean environment – the planet’s fundamental development challenges.
Instead, the index shows us that Cambodia – where more than 20% of the population lives on less than $1.90 per day – gets a green, outperforming an orange Spain on implementation of SDG 1: “End poverty in all its forms everywhere.”
On government efficiency, the report claims that Italy is doing worse than all countries except Venezuela – much worse than Burundi or even Syria – in a ranking topped by Singapore and, more surprisingly, Rwanda.
The United States scores a surprising number of reds and yellows, ranking 42nd out of 157 countries overall.
In fact, the US fails to achieve a single green ranking for any of the 17 SDGs, sharing this dubious honor with only Greece, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Spain, and Turkey, among OECD nations.
(War-torn Yemen, by contrast, scores green for both “Climate Action” and “Partnership for the Goals”.)
America-bashing is popular and easy. But US taxpayers do give nearly a quarter of all the money spent on direct development aid by rich countries.
A report that gives the world’s biggest donor the lowest possible rating for “Partnerships for the Goals” would seem to have some underlying issues.
(Myanmar, Uzbekistan, and Saudi Arabia all score green marks in this category.)
A larger problem is behind the report’s oddities: today’s development agenda is trying to be all things to all people.
The MDGs worked because they were few in number and sharply focused. The SDGs comprise an eye-watering 169 targets, which means there is no focus at all.
The US gets a less-than-stellar yellow for SDG 3, which covers health and wellbeing.
Why?
Life expectancy in the US is relatively high, and neonatal and maternal mortality rates are relatively low. It turns out that the overall US score is dragged down by the poor mark given for the country’s high number of traffic deaths.
But conflating car accidents in Ohio with neonatal mortality rates and HIV prevalence merely muddies the global development agenda.
And Australia gets a red on the “End Hunger” SDG, not because of significant starvation or micronutrient deficiency, but because its obesity rates are too high and its extensive agriculture has lower yields.
Obesity and agricultural efficiency in rich countries are certainly important.
But in the attempt to make sure both developing and developed countries have problems to solve, we’re losing sight of what really matters: Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy, active life.
That’s about one of every nine people on Earth. The vast majority live in developing countries, where 12.9% of the population is undernourished.
Solving micronutrient deficiencies was one of 19 specific targets identified by a panel of Nobel laureate economists who studied the SDG targets for the Copenhagen Consensus, the think tank I direct, and identified the most cost-effective ways to help people, protect the planet, and boost prosperity.
Targets such as achieving universal access to contraception and family planning, ending tuberculosis by 2030, freer global trade, ending fossil-fuel subsidies, and protecting coral reefs would help the environment and improve billions of lives.
Analysis showed that focusing on the panel’s top 19 targets would achieve about four times more in terms of welfare gains than would trying to distribute funds among all 169 targets.
Instead, governments are laboring with the sheer number of SDGs.
As the SDG Index admits, “countries appear to struggle with implementing the full range” of indicators.
Countries themselves are now doing the prioritization that the UN failed to do.
They cannot possibly achieve all 169 targets at once, so they focus on only some of them.
The real danger is that their selection will not be those targets that could do the most good per dollar, pound, rupee or peso spent, but those that have the most media appeal, NGO attention, or corporate interest.
We need to strip back the development agenda to its core issues, and focus on those areas where each dollar spent can achieve the most for humanity.
Only by doing so can a scorecard help us maximize development progress.

Seizing the Center
SANTIAGO – The international press is having a hard time labeling the political positions of Emmanuel Macron, the winner of the first round presidential ballot in France.
Some have called him liberal; others, moderate; most finally settled on centrist.
The choice is understandable, but not without problems.
It suggests a mere midpoint, as if the ideas of the center were just a combination of right and left.
In fact, successful centrist political movements belong to what sociologist Anthony Giddens called the radical center: they are ideologically intense and have distinct ideas of their own.
Macron and other liberals, like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, or the new party Ciudadanos in Spain, are still in the process of defining what they stand for.
Here is my take on what a modern liberal and centrist political agenda should include.
Begin with a little political philosophy.
The right likes to claim it stands for freedom.
But its idea of freedom is what Isaiah Berlin called negative liberty: freedom from government coercion, excessive regulation, or punitive taxes.
But, because a child who grew up in poverty, attended subpar schools, and was discriminated against lacks what Berlin called the positive liberty to become an astrophysicist or a Wall Street tycoon, centrists believe that government policy should secure basic opportunities in order to render citizens truly free.
The left, in turn, claims to stand for equality.
But what kind of equality?
Of income, wealth, happiness, fate?
Because it lacks precise answers to this question, the traditional left tends to overreach – allowing government to expand with no limits – or to focus on means instead of ends.
For example, leftists insist that university education should be free of charge, instead of focusing on the quality of that education.
Modern centrists, by contrast, advocate a government that is as large as the task of securing positive freedom requires – no more, no less.
American political philosopher Elizabeth Anderson calls this the standard of democratic equality.
Government should guarantee (and, if necessary, pay for) education that is good enough to deliver the skills that allow citizens to interact as democratic equals.
Rigorous math or language classes?
Absolutely.
Tennis or cooking lessons?
Maybe not.
A new liberal center should be pro-market, not pro-business.
It should start from the empirical observation that no economy has grown on a sustained basis without relying on markets and free exchange.
But, unlike libertarians, centrists do not think markets can cure all ills; on the contrary, in some cases (finance is the most obvious example), unregulated markets can be a source of instability.
And, unlike business-friendly conservatives, centrists do not think that market competition arises from thin air: it must be fostered through potent anti-monopoly policies.
Centrists should stand – in the useful nomenclature of the Financial Times columnist Philip Stephens – for patriotism and against nationalism. The free movement of people, goods, and services across national boundaries enhances efficiency and helps countries attain prosperity.
But human beings do not live by material prosperity alone.
We prosper spiritually when we feel part of a community, of a shared human enterprise. And today that sense of community is, more often than not, rooted in the nation-state.
The way to square this apparent circle is by noting that we love our motherland not because of a misplaced sense of ethnic or racial superiority, but because it stands for noble and universal values.
Macron can proudly call himself a French patriot because France gave the world liberté, égalité,and fraternité.
In the recent Dutch election, liberals could argue for respecting the rights of immigrants because respect and tolerance are traditional Dutch values, of which any Dutch patriot can be proud.
These are examples of what the philosopher Jürgen Habermas has called constitutional patriotism (others have called it civic patriotism).
This philosophical position has practical implications.
As a general principle, liberal centrists are strongly in favor of the international movement of people and goods.
But they should be willing to consider limits when national cohesion is at stake.
Rather than opposing immigration, they ought to offer an intelligent migration policy.
Another implication is that the politics of the center cannot afford to be bloodless and technocratic.
The love for liberal democratic institutions is not spontaneous; it must be nurtured. That is what republican pageantry and compelling political rhetoric are for.
Successful political leaders understand this.
Last but certainly not least, liberal centrists should be the anti-populists. Populists are demagogues who promise the unaffordable; they are willing to run deficits and incur debts that our grandchildren will have to repay.
Liberals, by contrast, understand that sound macroeconomics is good politics.
When Wall Street melted down in 2008-2009, only governments that had their fiscal houses in order could afford stimulus packages that allowed them to retain political support.
Chile is an example (full disclosure: I was Chile’s finance minister at the time).
But sound economics is not enough to give liberalism an edge in the fight against populism.
Populists pander.
They say whatever they think voters want to hear and manipulate their anxieties and fears.
By contrast, centrists should treat voters like grownups and tell them the plain truth and nothing but the truth.
Throughout his campaign Macron told the French what some of them probably did not want to hear: that France has lost competitiveness, that its industries no longer lead the globe, and that the French will have to acquire new skills, innovate more, and open their economy more – not less – to the world in order to prosper.
But French citizens understood – and many voted for Macron. Radical policies do not pay; but radical truthfulness does.
Now watch this video on the challenges facing France’s President-elect Emmanuel Macron:

A Banker’s Revolution
KUALA LUMPUR – Financial regulators are generally known for taking a measured and cautious approach to change.
But in the developing world, that reputation is being turned upside down.
In some of the world’s poorest countries, central bankers have proved willing to make bold decisions – embracing innovative approaches in their quest to broaden participation in the formal financial system, increase financial stability, and put their countries on the path to inclusive, sustainable economic growth.
Increasing financial inclusion requires fundamentally rethinking how a country’s financial system is structured and operates.
It also frequently necessitates the use of instruments outside of the central bankers’ traditional toolkit.
In Kenya, for instance, officials altered the regulatory framework to allow for the growth of mobile money.
In Malaysia, the central bank took a lead role in raising the public’s level of financial literacy.
And in the Philippines, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas helped double the number of access points where consumers could obtain financial services, supporting the opening of 517 micro-banking offices, many of them in municipalities with no traditional bank branches.
Likewise, in 2011, the Bank of Tanzania made a specific commitment to increase financial inclusion under the Alliance for Financial Inclusion’s Maya Declaration, a commitment by policymakers in the developing world to unlock the social and economic potential of the poor.
The result was dramatic and vastly exceeded expectations.
Tanzania reached its goal of providing 50% of its adult citizens with access to banking a year ahead of schedule, making the country a global leader in digital financial services.
As in neighboring Kenya, the game changer was the widespread adoption of mobile money.
“It may sound maverick,” said Benno Ndulu, the bank’s governor. “But we must let innovation run ahead of regulation.”
While East Africa is blazing the trail when it comes to electronic money, other parts of the world are adopting different innovative approaches.
Last year in Colombia, Congress passed a law creating a new type of financial institution called a Specialized Electronic Deposit and Payment Institution.
While not technically banks, these institutions are able to accept customer deposits and payments electronically through mobile phones or at licensed locations like a post office.
The effort is part of a larger national strategy, launched in 2014, to provide 76% of adults with financial access and 56% with active savings accounts by the end of 2016.
And in the Pacific region, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, and Vanuatu have banded together to create the Pacific Islands Regional Initiative (PIRI), which will enable every Pacific Island state, even those without a central bank, to share knowledge on improving access, quality, and usage of financial services in geographically challenging environments.
Each of these efforts started as a country-led initiative, born of particular challenges and designed to meet the specific needs of the local population.
But the accumulation of experience is proving invaluable.
As lessons are shared and successes provide inspiration for others, the impact is becoming exponential, with even the smallest countries demonstrating that they have a significant contribution to make.
Meanwhile, as central banks change how they operate, retail banks are responding with new ways of doing business.
Kenya’s Equity Bank has grown enormously by explicitly targeting the financially excluded; in just six years, it has expanded from a half-million customers to almost six million.
Telecommunication companies are also pioneering new services.
Tigo, for example, now serves more than 56 million customers in 14 countries in Latin America and Africa with products such as cross-border mobile payments and cashless services for sales agents.
As with any period of great change, it is not easy to see what lies ahead.
As Stephen Kehoe, Head of Global Financial Inclusion at Visa, recently noted, “The last seven years provide absolutely no indication of what the next seven years will be.”
What is clear, however, is that there still remains much to be done – and that the opportunities are nearly limitless.
Bringing the world’s two billion unbanked people out of the shadows and into the mainstream financial system will require new partnerships among regulators, the private sector, non-profits, regional bodies, and international organizations.
That may seem like a tall order, but filling it would help build a brighter future for everyone.

Argentina’s Energy Dilemma
BUENOS AIRES – The expropriation of nearly all of the Spanish company Repsol’s stake in Argentina’s energy producer YPF, announced in a vehement speech by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, has raised legal alarms worldwide. In fact, the move will not resolve the country’s energy problems in the absence of enormous inflows of investment to the sector.
Repsol acquired complete control of YPF in 1999; in February 2008, it transferred part of its shares to the Petersen Group, which today holds 25%.
Repsol currently holds 57%, with the rest owned by stock-market investors.
The Argentine government intends to expropriate 51%, leaving Repsol with a 6% stake.
In the 2008 sale of shares, the two majority stockholders agreed to distribute at least 90% of future profits in cash.
That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks, and to Repsol itself, that it incurred with its share purchase, for which it made no initial payment.
This is an extraordinarily high dividend in the world oil industry.
In the past decade, YPF’s reserves diminished significantly, along with those of most oil companies operating in Argentina, because investment in exploration was greatly reduced.
At the same time, natural gas accounts for 51% of energy consumption, compared to 32% for oil and barely 17% for coal, renewables, and hydroelectric and nuclear power.
Worldwide, gas accounts for barely a quarter of total energy consumption – for example, 27% in the United States and just 9% in neighboring Brazil.
Argentina has the world’s largest fleet of vehicles running on compressed natural gas; families use gas intensively; most electricity is generated with gas; and the petrochemical industry is based on it.
Of course, in a few other countries (Qatar, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Russia), gas also accounts for more than half – or even more than 60% – of energy consumption. But there is an enormous difference: all of these countries have reserves that will last another 70-100 years.
Argentina, by contrast, is a highly gas-dependent country with diminishing reserves – equivalent to less than eight years of production.
Covering this drop in reserves – more than half of gas reserves and a fifth of oil reserves have been consumed – with imports implies an annual cost of more than $300 billion.
Indeed, after two decades of cheap, abundant energy and exports of surplus output, a new cycle of expensive, scarce, and imported energy has begun, as oil production has fallen by one-third since 1998, and gas production by 15% since 2004.
Argentina’s greatest challenge today is to try to regain energy self-sufficiency through significant investment in exploration on land, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the country must modify its consumption model through greater reliance on hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind energy.
While there is great potential for new non-conventional resources, all of this is expensive, requiring annual investment of about 3% of GDP over the next five years.
It is very likely that, in the short term, growing imports of expensive liquid natural gas and other fuels will continue to exert pressure for change.
Last year, the external energy deficit was more than $3 billion, and this year it is expected to double.
The important question is whether the Argentine government’s decision to nationalize 51% of YPF’s shares is the best way to recover self-sufficiency in oil and gas production, and to attract the capital needed for exploration and development of conventional reserves.
Argentina has particularly high potential for production of non-conventional gas resources as well, given that it holds the world’s third-highest level of such reserves, after China and the United States. But, as with the country’s conventional resources, these reserves will not produce themselves.

Empowering Bangladesh’s Female Garment Workers
DHAKA – For four decades, the garment industry has powered Bangladesh’s economy and put more people to work than any other sector.
Women in particular have benefited from this hiring boom, and today, a majority of the industry’s four million employees are female.
But while the textile trade has put money in women’s purses and challenged a patriarchal society to evolve, economic empowerment has not greatly improved gender equality and female wellbeing.
On the contrary, women with jobs in Bangladesh’s largest industry are now imperiled on two fronts – at home and at work.
While much has been written about exploitation in the garment industry, there is a paucity of data on the health and safety implications for women in this sector.
Our organization, icddr,b (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh), is working to change this.
In a series of recent studies, we explored the health and welfare issues – both physical and emotional – faced by women who produce clothing that they will never be able to afford.
The women we spoke with shared markedly similar stories.
Most were or had been married, are poorly educated, and migrated to cities from poverty-stricken households in Bangladesh to work and support their families.
Most interviewees reported working at least ten hours per day, every day.
Many work overtime to meet their daily production quota of 100 shirts per hour.
And, depending on their position, they spend the entirety of their shifts either standing (if they are quality inspectors), sitting (if they are machine operators), or moving (if they are factory-floor helpers).
But what makes our studies unique is the information we collected about what happens after work.
And here, the data are even more striking.
For starters, most married female workers’ workdays don’t end when their shift at the factory does.
Back at home, they are expected to cook, clean, and perform other household chores – work on top of work that leaves them exhausted and prone to illness.
Pregnant women in particular suffer significant health problems, such as hypertension, owing to their brutal schedules.
And yet most women, needing the income, continue working and hide their pregnancies as long as possible, out of fear that supervisors will fire them when they find out.
This also takes an emotional toll.
Working mothers from rural villages report experiencing high levels of guilt, anxiety, and stress caused by being away from the children whom they often have to leave in their home village, because they cannot afford – in terms of time or money – to care for them in Dhaka.
Two out of five workers show suicidal tendencies.
Yet the factory health-care systems that we have studied do not treat mental illness as a serious problem.
In fact, most factories do not have any mental-health-care provisions at all for their workers. As a result, most women suffer in silence.
Finally, our research identified a disturbing correlation between employment in the garment industry and violence (physical, emotional, and sexual) against women.
A staggering 43% of respondents said they had been sexually assaulted by a spouse during the previous year.
To put this figure in perspective, the national average for this form of violence is 13%.
While we don’t have the data for a conclusive assessment of why rates of abuse are so high in the garment trade, the data are consistent with the prevailing popular view that women in this field are somehow associated with sex work and sexual promiscuity.
There is no doubt that women in Bangladesh have earned a degree of autonomy and financial independence from their participation in the garment industry.
But, as our data illustrate, these gains have come at a cost.
And, although activists and industry insiders recognize that attitudes and abusive practices toward female workers must change, there is currently no consensus about how to proceed.
We think it is time to change that, and a good place to start would be by pushing multinational firms to make gender equality a high priority.
Many of the global brands that rely on Bangladesh’s factories have committed to gender parity in their corporate offices.
They should do the same on the production side, where managerial positions are occupied almost exclusively by men, a disparity that reinforces the gender imbalance elsewhere in society.
But perhaps the most important change to be made is to engage men in a dialogue on gender.
In several African countries, gender-sensitization initiatives have reduced discrimination and violence against women.
One program in West Africa, for example, brings husbands and wives together for mediated “dialogue sessions” to improve women’s role in financial decision-making.
To make similar gains in Bangladesh, profound changes in policies and programs are needed.
The garment industry and men more broadly must commit to the goal of women’s empowerment.
After nearly 40 years on the job, women are the driving force behind Bangladesh’s most important industry.
But at the moment, they are paying too high a physical and emotional price.

World Cup Heralds a New Korea
The euphoria of fans whose team wins a major sporting event is ephemeral.
But, prominent professors at Korean universities tell me that the unprecedented success of the Korean team in the current World Cup competition is causing a turning point in Korean attitudes towards their own society and economy.
Why?
Many Koreans, especially those who studied or lived in the West, complain about the "cronyism", and the resulting importance of "connections" in all walks of Korean life, which they see as pervasive features of Korean society.
They claim that such rampant cronyism is preventing Korea from catching up economically with the West, despite the fact that Korea soon will have as much human capital as western countries.
To understand Korean cronyism we have to see it as one aspect of a set of related social conventions.
Koreans accept a sense of knowing one's place in society that seems extreme to Americans.
In social interactions, and also in business dealings, Koreans maintain a hierarchy that seems to weigh age more highly than performance.
Also, although admission to elite universities is as meritocratic in Korea as in the West, the outcome of the university entrance competition has a more important and more permanent effect on one's place in Korean society.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that in America people have to prove themselves continually, whereas in traditional Korean society people have only to prove themselves once, then they can be set for life due in large measure to the network of crony contacts that initial success will have provided.
What do Korean cronyism and related social conventions have to do with the World Cup?
In the past cronyism apparently has been as pervasive in the selection of Korean teams for international sports competitions as in other areas of Korean society.
But, two years ago when the Korean soccer football association hired the Dutchman, Guus Hiddink, to coach the Korean national soccer team, Hiddink made it clear that he would select his players based on merit alone.
The performance of the Korean team in the 2002 World Cup competition is demonstrating to every Korean in a way that is easily seen that meritocracy yields better results than cronyism.
It also helps that Hiddink has been able to use his coaching skills to bring out in his team the strengths of the Korean national character: intelligence, discipline, tenacity, and perseverance.
Of course, Korean traditionalists reject criticism of what westernized Koreans call cronyism.
Traditionalists argue that criticism of cronyism is really criticism of social solidarity and responsibility, which they see as positive features of Korean society.
Traditionalists also argue that meritocracy implies individualism, and that too much individualism and too little social solidarity and responsibility are negative features of western society.
Some traditionalists even might claim that they do not want Koreans to be as rich as westerners if that requires Koreans to be as individualistic as westerners.
The Hiddink phenomenon did not emerge suddenly out of thin air.
The accumulation of gradual changes that have already occurred in Korean society made it acceptable to import a westerner to coach the Korean national soccer team and to allow him to establish a meritocratic regime.
But Hiddink has expedited the process of change within Korean society, and his success has made it look revolutionary.
It remains to be seen how fast, in what ways, and with what effects, Korean society will continue to change.
Koreans are talking about learning the lessons of Hiddink.
But the western model of a meritocratic society is not easy to emulate.
A soccer team is a relatively simple organization.
Implementing the lessons of Hiddink throughout Korean society will present more difficult challenges.
Whatever the outcome, it seems that in the case of the 2002 World Cup the effects of success in a major sporting event will not be ephemeral.

Reversing the Death of Venice
VENICE – Some of the worst flooding in Venice’s history has submerged some of the historic city’s renowned cultural sites, including St. Mark’s Basilica on Piazza San Marco.
This is only the sixth time the basilica has been flooded in 1,200 years, but the fourth time in the last two decades, and the second time in under 400 days.
At this rate, Venice’s fragile embroidery of calli, campi, and palazzi, draped over sinking sediment, could be washed away within decades.
But what about the people who populate them?
Ancient Romans used two words to describe cities: urbs, which referred to the edifices and infrastructure, and civitas, or an active and engaged citizenry.
Today, the world is fretting over Venice’s soaked and damaged urbs, which is, to be sure, extremely vulnerable even to minor sea-level rises, like those brought about by climate change.
But it has largely failed to recognize the extent to which the Venetian civitas is unraveling.
Venice’s population has been shrinking for decades.
Today, there are just one-third as many Venetians as 50 years ago.
But that decline is merely a symptom of a rapidly worsening disease: the reckless promotion of large-scale tourism and lack of investment in human capital.
Had Venice’s political leaders not begun to shift resources away from higher education and innovation in the 1980s, Venice could have emerged by now as a kind of Cambridge on the Adriatic.
But tourism was viewed as a much faster route to growth.
So, with the government’s help, the number of visitors steadily climbed: in 2017, the city of 260,000 received more than 36 million foreign tourists.
As Venetians have fled the hordes, Venice’s civil society has deteriorated and political torpor has become entrenched.
Municipal leaders prefer to complain about the city’s weaknesses, rather than taking effective action to address them.
And Italy’s national government has consistently failed to use its authority in the city constructively.
These trends contributed to the inadequate environmental surveillance that left the urbs so exposed.
Yes, Venice is engaged in a €5.5 billion ($6 billion) flood-barrier project, called Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico (MOSE).
But the project, launched in 1984 – when Venice was already sinking – and inaugurated in 2003, was supposed to be completed in 2011. It remains unfinished.
Even if MOSE is finished by its current deadline in 2021, neither it nor any other construction project would be enough to protect Venice.
While infrastructure investment is obviously critical – especially to adapt to climate change –Venice must look beyond the urbs to restore the civitas if is to avoid the demise that many are predicting.
The first step is to remove Venice from the jurisdiction of the Italian government, whose consistent failures have driven the city’s decline in recent decades.
This is not some parochial demand for the revival of the Republic of San Marco. It is a call for a new type of outward-looking political construct: an “open city” that welcomes anyone who genuinely wants to settle there as a full-fledged citizen, not as participants in what the American novelist Don DeLillo called tourism’s “march of stupidity.”
This new, open Serenissima (as the medieval Venetian Republic was called) would work specifically to attract a capable and engaged civitas that is prepared to help protect and rebuild the urbs. This would include innovators with credible business plans (and their financial backers), engineers researching climate-change adaptation, professionals such as doctors or lawyers, and students willing to dedicate a few years to helping restore the Venetian Lagoon’s magnificent palazzos.
Venice would thus become a testing ground for an innovative urban model based on a new social contract suited to what the sociologist Manuel Castells called a global “space of flows.”
This may seem like a radical proposal, but it is not without precedent.
In the mid-fourteenth century, Venice’s population plummeted by 60%, owing to outbreaks of bubonic plague.
The city opened itself up to foreigners, offering citizenship to anyone who planned to remain for the long term.
Newcomers needed only to embrace the key characteristics of “Venetianness,” including the desire to work.
There is no reason why a similar strategy cannot work today.
In fact, thanks to digital tools, it would be easier than ever to measure civic engagement, from time spent in the city – many properties in Venice are owned by non-residents and used only a few days per year – to concrete contributions, which could become a source of social-media pride.
A hefty tax on non-resident property owners – who are generally extremely wealthy – would also help support the local community.
As sea levels rise and Venice sinks, the city must take strong action to restore and protect its urbs.
But such efforts will mean little without a prosperous and engaged civitas.
To save Venice, we must first save the Venetians – above all from themselves.

Imperialism Reclaimed
LONDON – History has no final verdicts.
Major shifts in events and power bring about new subjects for discussion and new interpretations.
Fifty years ago, as de-colonization accelerated, no one had a good word to say for imperialism.
It was regarded as unambiguously bad, both by ex-imperialists and by their liberated subjects.
Schoolchildren were taught about the horrors of colonialism, how it exploited conquered peoples.
There was little mention, if any, of imperialism’s benefits.
Then, in the 1980’s, a revisionist history came along.
It wasn’t just that distance lends a certain enchantment to any view.
The West – mainly the Anglo-American part of it – had recovered some of its pride and nerve under US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And there was the growing evidence of post-colonial regimes’ failure, violence, and corruption, especially in Africa.
But the decisive event for the revisionists was the collapse of the Soviet empire, which not only left the United States top dog globally, but also seemed, to the more philosophically minded, to vindicate Western civilization and values against all other civilizations and values.
With the European Union extending its frontiers to embrace many ex-communist states, the West became again, if briefly, the embodiment of universal reason, obliged and equipped to spread its values to the still-benighted parts of the world.
Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man testified to this sense of triumph and historical duty.
Such a conjuncture set the stage for a new wave of imperialism (though the reluctance to use the word remained).
In doing so, it was bound to affect interpretations of the old imperialism, which was now extolled for spreading economic progress, the rule of law, and science and technology to countries that would never have benefited from them otherwise.
Foremost among the new generation of revisionist historians was Niall Ferguson of Harvard University, whose television series, based on his new book Civilization: The West and the Rest, has just started showing in Britain.
In its first episode, Ferguson appears amid the splendid monuments of China’s Ming Dynasty, which, in the fifteenth century, was undoubtedly the greatest civilization of the day, with its naval expeditions reaching the coasts of Africa.
After that, it was all downhill for China (and “the Rest”) and all uphill for the West.
Ferguson snazzily summarizes the reasons for this reversal in six “killer apps”: competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society, and the work ethic.
Against such tools – unique products of Western civilization – the rest had no chance.
From such a perspective, imperialism, old and new, has been a beneficent influence, because it has been the means of spreading these “apps” to the rest of the world, thereby enabling them to enjoy the fruits of progress hitherto confined to a few Western countries.
Understandably, this thesis has not met with universal approbation.
The historian Alex von Tunzelmann accused Ferguson of leaving out all of imperialism’s nasty bits: the Black War in Australia, the German genocide in Namibia, the Belgian exterminations in the Congo, the Amritsar Massacre, the Bengal Famine, the Irish potato famine, and much else.
But that is the weakest line of attack.
Edward Gibbon once described history as being little better than a record of the “crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.”
Imperialism certainly added its quota to these. But the question is whether it also provided, through Hegel’s “cunning of reason,” the means to escape from them.
Even Marx justified British rule in India on these grounds.
Ferguson, too, can make a sound argument for such a proposition.
The most serious weakness in Ferguson’s presentation is his lack of sympathy for the civilizations dismissed as “the rest,” which also points to the most serious limitation of the revisionist case.
The “triumph of the West” that followed the collapse of Communism in Europe was clearly not the “end of history.”
As Ferguson must know, the main topic of discussion in international affairs nowadays concerns the “rise” of China, and more generally Asia, as well as the stirring of Islam.
Of course, the Chinese may prefer to talk about “restoration” rather than “rise,” and point to a “harmonious” pluralism of the future. But “rise” is how most people think of China’s recent history, and in history the rise of some is usually associated with the decline of others.
In other words, we may be reverting to that cyclical pattern that historians assumed to be axiomatic before the seemingly irreversible rise of the West implanted in them a view of linear progress toward greater reason and freedom.
Europe is plainly in decline, politically and culturally, though most Europeans, blinded by their high living standards and the pretensions of their impotent statesmen, are happy to dress this up as progress.
Chinese savings are underwriting much of the American civilizing mission that Ferguson applauds.
The pattern seems clear: the West is losing dynamism, and the rest are gaining it.
The remainder of this century will show how this shift plays out.
For the moment, most of us have lost the historical plot.
It is possible, for example, to imagine a “Western world” (one that applies Ferguson’s “killer apps”) in which the actual West is no longer the dominant factor: America will simply passes the torch to China, as Britain once did to America.
But it seems to me extremely unlikely that China, India, and “the rest” will simply take over Western values wholesale, for this would amount to renouncing any value in their own civilizations.
Some syntheses and accommodations between the West and the rest will inevitably accompany the shift in power and wealth from the former to the latter.
The only question is whether the process will be peaceful.

Whither Africa’s “Frontier Markets”?
NEW YORK – Zimbabwe’s election appears, once again, to confirm a truism: Africa only seems to make international headlines when disasters strike – a drought, a coup, a war, a genocide, or, as in the case of Robert Mugabe, grossly incompetent government.
But, over the past several years, a number of sub-Saharan countries have attracted unprecedented inflows of foreign capital. Recent global financial turmoil has only added to Africa’s allure, because its frontier markets are less vulnerable to international volatility than are most of the world’s more familiar emerging economies.
There are three main reasons why many sub-Saharan countries are performing well.
First, high commodity prices yield windfall profits for the region’s leading producers of raw materials.
Growing demand for energy, metals, and minerals – particularly in China – has driven unprecedented levels of foreign investment.
Even large pension funds are beginning to take notice.
Moreover, a large number of Africa’s poorest countries have benefited from exponential growth in (primarily United States-based) philanthropy.
But, while both of these positive trends are likely to continue, a third positive factor may not prove as durable.
Every year, Africans living outside the continent send roughly $30 billion to family and friends back home.
These remittances are vitally important for economic stability in several African countries.
An economic slowdown in the US and Europe could substantially slow this infusion of cash, because immigrants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fears take hold.
At the same time, though Africa’s frontier economies are less vulnerable than other emerging markets to global financial turbulence, they are highly vulnerable to political turmoil closer to home.
The three countries that served as pillars of regional stability for the past several years – Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa – are now too pre-occupied with political troubles of their own to provide the peacekeepers, reconstruction funds, and political pressure that often limit the damage from conflicts elsewhere in the region.
Most of Nigeria’s problems are well known.
Militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta region have at times shut down as much as 30% of the country’s oil exports, a vital source of state revenue.
President Umaru Yar’Adua has taken concrete steps to tackle elite-level corruption in Nigeria, and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the Delta rebels.
But Yar’Adua might soon confront a big short-term problem.
The country’s National Election Tribunal, having overturned the outcomes of several provincial elections, may well annul the results of last year’s presidential race, forcing him to run for president all over again.
While Yar’Adua could use the goodwill that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin, the 90-day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil unrest, and Nigeria’s leadership would be too busy navigating domestic political rivalries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in Africa.
Kenya’s troubles run deeper.
Solid economic expansion and one of the world’s fastest-growing stock markets have not helped the country avert a deepening political crisis and mounting ethnic violence since disputed presidential election results in December.
President Mwai Kibaki, whom international observers accuse of rigging the vote, has hinted at a plan to share power in a unity government, but opposition leader Raila Odinga has heard these promises before.
Odinga worked hard to help elect Kibaki in 2002, only to see Kibaki renege on a similar pledge.
Despite the alarming escalation in violence, fears of civil war in Kenya are probably exaggerated.
The country’s Orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and, for the moment, is heeding calls for calm from former United nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and representatives of the African Union. But no one should expect Kenya to play a stabilizing regional role again anytime soon.
The continent’s third pillar, South Africa, will spend 2008 mired in an escalating political feud between Thabo Mbeki, the lame-duck president, and Jacob Zuma, a former deputy who is the newly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress and the leading candidate to succeed Mbeki, his bitter rival, next year.
South Africa’s courts have become a political battleground, as Mbeki and his allies use corruption charges to try to cripple Zuma’s candidacy.
The resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country’s trade union movement and Communist Party, challenging the political elite’s pro-market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa’s economic policy.
No countries in sub-Saharan Africa will have the economic heft and political self-confidence to replace Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as pillars of stability anytime soon.
Regional blocs like the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and the East African Community (EAC) will eventually assume larger roles in helping resolve the continent’s most intractable diplomatic and economic problems. But that won’t happen this year.
There remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on Africa’s frontier markets. But it will not necessarily take a drought, a coup, a war, or a genocide to make them think twice.

The “Digital Revolution” of Wellbeing
MILAN – Western attitudes toward digital technology have soured in recent years, as once-celebrated innovations have begun to reveal their downsides.
But, like all technological revolutions, the digital one is a double-edged sword, offering substantial benefits alongside daunting challenges – and certainly not only in the West.
For example, studies show that e-commerce and digital finance in China have contributed to both the rate and inclusiveness of economic growth.
Very small businesses (with an average of three employees) that could not access conventional sources of credit can now get financing.
They also can tap into expanded markets through various online platforms, many of which provide tools and data to boost productivity, improve product quality, and benefit from business training.
In general, e-commerce platforms enhance financial and economic inclusion if they are open and geared toward broadening access to digital markets, rather than competing with their own users’ product lines.
By contrast, digitally driven automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning have non-inclusive effects – owing to major labor-market disruptions – that must be countered.
At the same time, as in past periods of technological transformation, we should expect significant changes in the relative prices of goods, services, and assets as we advance into the digital age.
In terms of jobs, the skills associated with creating or using the new technologies will increase in value, while those for which digital technologies represent a superior substitute will decline in value – sometimes absolutely.
This transition to a new equilibrium will take time and impose costs on individual workers and industries.
Governments will need to respond with new or expanded social services and regulations.
But even in the best cases, the process will not be easy.
Though automation is just one facet of the digital revolution, it represents a major challenge, particularly with respect to income distributions.
But the longer the transition is delayed, the longer it will take to realize the new technologies’ contributions to productivity and growth.
Nowadays, one often hears commentators questioning why productivity is trending downward if we are in the middle of a digital revolution.
Part of the answer is that there is a lag in the skills needed to embed the new technologies across sectors and within business models and supply chains.
A related problem applies to countries in the early stages of development, where labor-intensive process-oriented manufacturing and assembly has played an indispensable role in achieving sustained growth.
Advances in robotics and automation are now eroding the developing world’s traditional source of comparative advantage.
To be sure, e-commerce platforms could serve as a partial alternative to manufacturing exports by accelerating the expansion of internal markets.
But the real prize is the global marketplace.
Only if digital platforms could be extended to tap into global demand would they suggest an alternative growth model (provided that tariffs and regulatory barriers do not get in the way).
Another key component of the digital revolution is data, owing to its value when pooled, aggregated, and analyzed with the right tools.
The rise of business models based on extracting this value has raised privacy concerns.
A particularly sensitive case, for example, is health data, such as DNA and medical records, which have significant potential value for biomedical science, but which also could cause serious harm if placed in the wrong hands.
The challenge will be to devise a regulatory framework that ensures the privacy and security of personal data, while enabling business models that depend on its collection and use.
More broadly, today’s technological advances have created a macroeconomic conundrum, insofar as growth and productivity trends appear to be heading in the wrong direction.
Beyond the skills lag, one possible explanation – but certainly not the majority view – is that the digital “revolution” is not all that revolutionary.
Another explanation is that digital technologies tend to have unusual (though not unique) cost structures, with high fixed costs giving way to zero-to-low marginal costs.
Thus, when considered across a vast array of applications and geographic locations, the average costs of some key technologies are negligible.
The highly valuable “free” services that we use have, in fact, been properly priced at their marginal cost.
Similarly, exponential improvements in the power and utility of digital products can also be achieved at minimal cost.
Today’s smartphones are more powerful than the supercomputers of the mid-1980s and cost a fraction of the price.
Now, it is certainly possible that a 10,000-fold increase in computing power at negligible additional cost over the past 20 years has yielded minimal consumer benefits; but it is highly unlikely.
More to the point, none of these gains is captured in national income accounts.
That is not to suggest that we should scrap or revise GDP; but we do need to recognize its limitations.
The problem with GDP is not that it is a poor measure of material wellbeing (setting aside distributional issues), but that it is incomplete. It does not include the increase in the scope of goods and services delivered at negative incremental cost, nor the non-material side of individual wellbeing or social progress more generally.
Looking ahead, the same cost-structure dynamics promise to produce large increases in many areas of wellbeing.
Most medical professionals will soon have digital assistants to offer diagnoses (particularly for certain cancers, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic illnesses), perform non-invasive surgeries, or find pertinent published research.
And many of these services will be available remotely to people around the world, including in poor or otherwise vulnerable communities.
Likewise, technological improvements with zero-to-low marginal costs could have a significant impact on sustainability, another key ingredient in long-term wellbeing.
Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that, over time, most of the benefits from digital technologies will fall outside the narrow dimension of quantifiable material welfare.
This is not to dismiss or minimize the challenges that must be confronted in that domain, particularly with respect to inequality.
But a wise approach to those problems would reflect the steady rebalancing of benefits, costs, risks, and vulnerabilities in the digital age.

All Quiet on the Burundi Front?
Like its neighbors, Congo and Rwanda, Burundi is a war-torn land.
Its troubles have not riveted world attention in recent years, probably because Burundi's rebels failed to plumb the depths of savagery seen in Rwanda and Congo.
But, unlike its neighbors, this year can mark a turning point for Burundi.
Thanks to agreements between the rebels and the government that Nelson Mandela and South African Vice President Jacob Zuma helped broker, Burundi can now either turn decisively away from civil strife, or risk a return to the machete politics that have mauled Africa's Great Lakes region for a decade.
Since its independence from Belgium in 1962, Burundi has suffered five episodes of what amounts to the same civil war.
About 600,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands made into refugees.
Many portray this war as the result of hatred between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi.
But this does not explain why these groups supposedly hate each other so much.
Burundi's cultural and linguistic homogeneity, rare in Africa, belies the simplistic view that the Hutu and Tutsi fight because they are so different.
Indeed, most countries are far more heterogeneous than Burundi but have never fallen into ethnic war.
To understand the dynamics of conflict in Burundi, we need to examine three root causes.
The first such cause is the legacy of colonization.
In the 1920's and 1930's, the Belgian authorities enacted policies that defined the population along ethnic lines and favored the Tutsi in a deliberate - and successful - effort to divide society and fan resentment among Hutu leaders.
Second, the bloody 1959 revolution in Rwanda, a country mirroring Burundi's ethnic and social structure, induced Burundi's Tutsi to cling even more tightly to power.
At the same time, Burundi's Hutu saw Rwanda as a role model and believed their ethnic majority should guarantee them de facto control of the country.
Third, successive governments widened the ethnic divide through catastrophically predatory governance.
A tiny elite of Tutsi from the southern province of Bururi controlled all institutions, exploiting them to the fullest.
The army brutally suppressed any opposition to Bururi rule.
No surprise, then, that millions of Burundians felt alienated, and that many resorted to violence.
In October 1993, the killing by members of the army of Melchior Ndadaye, the first civilian, Hutu, non-Bururi, and democratically elected president provoked a bloody reaction by the Hutu.
Presidential assassinations do not necessarily lead to civil wars, but in Burundi, a large-scale massacre of Tutsi civilians by Hutu immediately followed the coup attempt.
Fearing retribution by the Tutsi-dominated army, large numbers of Hutu fled the country while armed rebels engaged the army.
For the first time, the army failed to crush the rebellion.
As a result, the Tutsi-dominated government entered into negotiations with Hutu leaders, which led to the signing of a political accord in August 2000.
But the accord had a major flaw: the absence of a cease-fire.
Violence only receded in 2003, when the main rebel group, the Forces pour la défense de la démocratie (FDD), concluded a political and military accord with the government.
Currently, insecurity is confined to the area surrounding Bujumbura, the capital, where the Forces Nationales de libération, a small radical group, continue to fight.
There are strong indications that even this group is seeking compromise.
These breakthroughs came about thanks to the dedicated mediation of Mandela and Zuma.
The presidents of Uganda and Tanzania, and the international community in general, also exerted leverage.
(Burundi is an aid-dependent country, so donors have considerable sway in influencing its rulers' behavior.)
The question now is whether each party will honor its commitments.
What guarantees exist that the rebel groups will fully demobilize?
Why should the rebels believe that the government will honor its commitments once they no longer represent a threat?
Neither party, it seems, can commit credibly to peace.
Burundi's donors need to join hands with African leaders to make certain that the agreements are implemented.
Everyone agrees that recent pledges of a $1 billion in aid are a sign that donors are ready to show Burundians that peace has a dividend.
But aid will help build peace only if it is carefully used.
It must be distributed to the needy rather than favoring the elite - a tendency established in the past.
Yet it would be dangerous to redress past imbalances solely at the expense of traditional beneficiaries, especially because they remain powerful enough to derail the peace process.
It is encouraging to note that Burundi's leaders have so far managed to integrate leaders from the opposition and rebel groups into the country's political and military institutions without dismissing incumbents.
The danger is that applying this approach rigorously will invariably result in a bloated civil service and army.
But while downsizing government may be fashionable in the West, now is not the time for slimming down Burundi's state sector.
For once, over employment is politically justified.
The international community must understand that the political benefits of not alienating the old elite while offering new opportunities to traditionally excluded groups outweigh the financial cost.
Burundi will need even deeper pockets from its donors to transform today's political overtures into sustainable peace.

A Perfectly Crazy Idea for the IMF
GENEVA – In the movie Dangerous Minds, the actress Michelle Pfeiffer plays a former US Marine who becomes a teacher in an inner-city high school.
In a difficult environment, where academic achievement is far from the top of the rebellious teens’ list of priorities, Pfeiffer’s character comes up with an unorthodox – and effective – new approach: each student will start the year with an “A” grade, which is theirs to lose.
At a time when many emerging-market economies are as discouraged as Pfeiffer’s students, perhaps the International Monetary Fund should take a page out of her playbook.
Emerging economies inhabit a risky world characterized by volatile capital flows.
But, rather than rely on the IMF to fulfill its mandate of protecting them from liquidity crises, they self-insure by accumulating large stockpiles of international reserves.
Emerging and developing economies now lend nearly $7.5 trillion to the US Treasury – resources that could be used to fund badly needed infrastructure projects.
What is curious about this approach is that the IMF’s record in handling financial crises, though far from perfect, is generally quite good.
So why the reluctance to count on the Fund?
Perhaps the most obvious reason is timing.
For historical reasons, most Fund facilities are better suited to managing crises than they are to preventing them.
By the time countries turn to the IMF for support, they have already lost access to international capital markets.
Yet they have to engage in protracted negotiations that allow the situation to deteriorate before it improves.
Tapping a country’s own reserves may not be an ideal option, but at least it is fast.
But the IMF does offer a fast option.
The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) facility grants immediate access to Fund resources, no questions asked.
It amounts to a pre-approved loan that eligible countries can obtain whenever they want, on the basis of the strength of their fundamentals and policy record.
It is thus the perfect tool for preventing self-fulfilling liquidity crises.
Yet IMF members do not seem to be interested in the FCL.
Seven years after the facility was developed, only three countries (Colombia, Mexico, and Poland) have access to it.
While not all of the Fund’s 189 members could qualify for it, the number that do is a lot higher than three.
The FCL-like Precautionary and Liquidity Line, which has an even lower bar for eligibility, has only two takers.
The problem is stigma.
Countries fear that by applying for pre-approval – a process that they are not confident will remain confidential, as promised – they will signal potential economic problems.
Worse, they could be rejected, either the first time they apply or when their approval comes up for review (every 1-2 years); that would surely undermine confidence in their economies, if word of it were to get out.
This is where Pfeiffer’s strategy comes in.
Instead of forcing countries to work for approval, the IMF could create a new FCL-like facility for which all of its members are pre-approved, with the exception of countries that do not meet certain criteria in terms of policies and fundamentals.
Exceptions could be identified as part of the IMF’s so-called Article IV consultations with members – an approach that would strengthen IMF country surveillance.
As for the rest, pre-approval would substantially diminish the temptation to self-insure by accumulating reserves.
As with any attempt to change the status quo, this approach would raise challenges.
For starters, IMF staff could face political pressure from countries that did not qualify, particularly if those countries were among the IMF’s more influential members.
But, as Tito Cordella and Eduardo Levy Yeyati suggested in 2006, this risk could be mitigated by specific, measurable, and transparent criteria.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it would preclude more nuanced country-specific analyses involving qualitative assessments.
Moreover, if evaluations were made public, negative assessments could precipitate crises.
Ensuring that the eligibility criteria are clear and specific could help to prevent such an outcome.
A more direct approach to preventing crises in weaker economies would be to create a continuous eligibility scale, akin to the sovereign rating scale (which does not have a large effect on country risk), with countries at different points on the scale having access to different types of precautionary facilities.
The final risk is that, if many countries fulfill the criteria, the Fund might not have enough resources to meet its commitments in a crisis.
This problem could be solved by boosting the Fund’s capacity to borrow, while reducing the amount of resources that the Fund needs to set aside for FCL-like facilities.
After all, a successful precautionary credit line is one that is never (or very rarely) used.
Financial globalization demands a stronger global financial safety net.
Economists and policymakers have been tinkering with the international financial architecture since the mid-1990s, without much success.
While the idea of redefining the status quo may sound crazy, it may be, to paraphrase the physicist Niels Bohr, just crazy enough to be right.

Is China Strong or Weak?
IRVINE, CALIFORNIA – China’s government has been using unusually strong language of late to assert its sovereignty over disputed stretches of international waters near to its shores. This has led to a ratcheting up of tensions, in particular between China and the United States, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressing that the Obama administration is now ready to step in and help ensure the fair adjudication of disputes relating to the South China Sea.
Chinese spokesmen denounced this as a throwback to the days when America thought it could, and should, try to “contain” the People’s Republic.
One way to interpret China’s elevated rhetoric – and its tough response to joint US-South Korean military maneuvers – is as another indication that Chinese leaders have grown supremely self-confident and are eager to throw their weight around.
The reality, though, is more complex.
A closer look reveals that President Hu Jintao’s words and deeds are often shaped by a mixture of insecurity and cockiness, and that Chinese officials alternate between playing up and playing down the country’s rise.
Of course, there are moments when China’s leaders do seem like people who know that they are succeeding and want others to acknowledge it.
Even before the current diplomatic controversies, China’s leaders were gleefully drawing attention to how much more effective their stimulus package had been than Obama’s in countering the negative effects of the financial crisis.
And yet, when news broke last month that China had officially replaced Japan as the world’s second-largest economy, instead of crowing about surpassing a longtime rival and having the top spot, held by the US, in its sights, the government issued statements emphasizing that theirs remains a “poor, developing” country.
The self-confident side of the leadership’s split personality is often what worries China’s neighbors and the US alike. Still, it is important to remember that there’s a positive aspect to the Party’s self-confidence.
As political scientist Kevin O’Brien has argued, China’s increased readiness to compromise with some domestic protesters, rather than treat all forms of collective action as subversive, can be seen as reflecting a growing sense of security.
Conversely, some of China’s most disturbing moves can be chalked up to exaggerated feelings of insecurity.
Consider the harsh treatment of the gadfly critic Liu Xiaobao, sentenced to 11 years in prison on trumped-up charges of “subversion” for launching an Internet petition drive championing civil liberties.
Would a truly self-confident ruling elite have been so skittish about his activism?
The confident side of the Chinese leadership’s split personality is easy to understand.
From the late 1980’s until 2000, many observers presented the Party as being on its last legs, certain to succumb to the “Leninist extinction” that began with communism’s collapse in Europe.
But the Party remains in charge today. Airport bookstores that once displayed Gordon G. Chang’s The Coming Collapse of China now offer Martin Jacques’ When China Rules the World.
Why, then, do China’s rulers continue to backslide into doubt and fear, and why do they seek to avoid having China labeled a superpower?
For starters, downplaying China’s rise has practical benefits.
It helps to be seen as a “poor, developing” country, not as an economic giant, because “developed” nations are expected to do more to combat major global challenges, like climate change.
At the same time, China really is still a “poor” country in terms of per capita income. And parts of the country are more similar to sections of troubled “developing” countries than to China’s showplace cities.
The Party is in a vulnerable position – and knows it. That is no excuse for paranoia and repression, but just because the Party has outlasted predictions of its demise does not mean that it has no Achilles heel.
Most notably, the anger over corruption and nepotism that fueled the Tiananmen protests has never gone away.
China’s leaders thus continue to depend on a form of nationalism structured around tales of victimhood.
They now base their legitimacy on the notion that the Party, which rose to power as the nation fought foreign domination, is uniquely qualified to keep China from being bullied in a hostile international arena, and that only they can provide the stable environment needed for growth.
The Chinese leadership’s split personality explains a curious phenomenon that former US State Department adviser Susan Shirk noted in her book China: Fragile Superpower.
When she mentioned the book’s title to American friends, they wondered why she used the modifier “fragile,” whereas Chinese friends said calling their country a “superpower” was premature.
Shirk’s title still captures a significant phenomenon that bedevils diplomatic affairs.
Outsiders are increasingly convinced that China is a superpower, and that it needs to show that it can be a responsible one. But China’s rulers only sometimes embrace the designation – and the Party still sometimes behaves as if it had only a tenuous hold on power.

A New Deal for Poor Farmers
NEW YORK – Many poor, food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months, as global prices of rice, wheat, and maize have doubled.
Hundreds of millions of poor people, who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food, are being pushed to the edge. Food riots are mounting.
But many poor countries can grow more food themselves, because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible.
In some cases, with appropriate government action, they could double or even triple food production in just a few years.
The idea is basic and well known.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
Poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season, lack fertilizer, depend on rain rather than irrigation, and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe.
Their farms are small, perhaps one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
Under traditional agricultural conditions, the yields of grain – rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet – are usually around one ton per hectare, for one planting season per year.
For a farm family of five or six living on one hectare, this means extreme poverty, and for their country, it means reliance on expensive food imports, including food aid.
The solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons – and in some places to three or more tons – per hectare.
If water can be managed through irrigation, this could be combined with multi-cropping (multiple harvests per year) to produce a crop during the dry season.
Higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families, and lower food prices for cities.
The key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties (usually “hybrid” seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties), chemical fertilizers, organic matter to replenish soil nutrients, and, where possible, small-scale irrigation methods, such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well.
There is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960’s.
The problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries.
When peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral, they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation.
As a result, they grow food the traditional way, often earning little or nothing from their harvest, because it’s not even enough to keep their families alive.
History has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap.
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies, income can rise, and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral.
With a bit of temporary help, perhaps lasting around five years, farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis, either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans.
Around the world, government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs, but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies.
Of course, there were abuses, such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones, or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy.
And in many cases, government agricultural banks went bankrupt.
Still, the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid.
During the debt crisis of the 1980’s and 1990’s, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems.
Poor farmers were told to fend for themselves, to let “market forces” provide for inputs.
This was a profound mistake: there were no such market forces.
Poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties.
They could not obtain bank financing. To its credit, the World Bank recognized this mistake in a scathing internal evaluation of its long-standing agricultural policies last year.
The time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries, notably those farming on two hectares or less, to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons, and has doubled its food production as a result.
Other low-income countries should follow suit.
Importantly, the World Bank, under its new president, Robert Zoellick, has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach.
If the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs, then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time.
Donor governments, including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, should help finance the World Bank’s new efforts.
The world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions (such as Haiti) during the next five years. That’s achievable if the World Bank, donor governments, and poor countries direct their attention to the urgent needs of the world’s poorest farmers.

The US Economy’s Dirty Secret
SAN DIEGO – There is a dirty little secret in economics today: the United States has benefited – and continues to benefit – from the global slump.
The US economy is humming along, even while protesters in the United Kingdom hurl milkshakes at Brexiteers, French President Emmanuel Macron confronts nihilist yellow-vested marchers, and Chinese tech firms such as Huawei fear being frozen out of foreign markets.
Last year, the US economy grew by 2.9%, while the eurozone expanded by just 1.8%, giving President Donald Trump even more confidence in his confrontational style.
But relatively strong US growth amid sluggishness elsewhere is not what economics textbooks would predict.
Whatever happened to the tightly integrated world economy that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been advocating – and more recently extolling – since World War II?
The US economy is in a temporary but potent phase in which weakness abroad lifts spirits at home.
But this economic euphoria has nothing to do with Trump-era spite and malice, and much to do with interest rates.
Borrowing costs are currently lower than at any time since the founding of the US Federal Reserve in 1913, or in the UK’s case since the Bank of England was established in 1694.
The ten-year US Treasury bond is yielding about 2.123%, and in April, the streaming service Netflix issued junk bonds at a rate of just 5.4%.
If a Rip Van Winkle economist were to wake up today after a decades-long sleep and see only those numbers, he or she would assume that one-fifth of Americans were unemployed and standing in lines outside soup kitchens.
Instead, the US jobless rate is at its lowest level since Neil Armstrong took his famous first step onto the Moon’s surface 50 years ago.
The idea that the US wins in a global slump might sound like the sardonic musing of some unreconstructed Marxist in the dingy corner of a faculty lounge.
But such a view is not ideological.
Rather, global interest rates are scraping the floor because GDP growth outside the US is so sluggish.
Persistently low interest rates and weak inflation bring multiple benefits to the US economy.
For starters, American consumers, whose real (inflation-adjusted) wages are finally increasing after decades of stagnation, are seeing all sorts of bargains.
When I visited an Apple store a few days ago, an employee at the repair counter told me that I could finance a new iPhone at 0% interest.
Car dealers are offering zero-interest financing, too.
Moreover, the US stock market has soared because yields on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) look so puny.
When I was a kid in the 1970s, my mother placed our family savings in a bank and received not only a 6% return, but also a blender.
Today, a six-month bank CD might pay only one-third of a percentage point.
And my mother can no longer expect a blender or even a lollipop from the bank in return for parking her money there.
Finally, low interest rates mean that US businesses can obtain nearly free financing when they purchase equipment.
As a result of low borrowing costs and new tax write-offs, the US economy added 215,000 new machine manufacturing jobs in 2018.
And foreign investors realize that new equipment will make US companies more competitive.
But surely, the textbooks insist, a hobbled global economy will squeeze US exports.
That is true – especially when combined with China’s new tariffs on American goods and a strong dollar, which makes US exports more expensive internationally.
Still, exports make up only 12% of the US economy, and nearly one-third of them go to Canada and Mexico, whose economies have been doing okay.
Moreover, many of the most valuable US exports are “must-have” items (or oligopolistic goods made by only a few companies), such as Boeing jets, Qualcomm chips, or Apple iPhones.
It is hard even for dejected Frenchmen or angst-ridden Germans to do without these.
The buoyancy of the US economy worries policymakers in other countries.
They would prefer if the US stumbled along beside them and was forced to concoct cooperative ways of boosting global growth.
Instead, Trump needles rather than wheedles for trade deals, and happily pockets the benefits to the US economy that result from doldrums abroad.
No one knows when Trump’s trade needling will stop, of course.
But as long as inflation remains a distant specter, America’s economy will continue to enjoy this unusual type of growth.

Economics Needs a Climate Revolution
BRUSSELS/NEW YORK – Nowhere are the limitations of neoclassical economic thinking – the DNA of economics as it is currently taught and practiced – more apparent than in the face of the climate crisis.
While there are fresh ideas and models emerging, the old orthodoxy remains deeply entrenched. Change cannot come fast enough.
The economics discipline has failed to understand the climate crisis – let alone provide effective policy solutions for it – because most economists tend to divide problems into small, manageable pieces.
Rational people, they are wont to say, think at the margin. What matters is not the average or totality of one’s actions but rather the very next step, weighed against the immediate alternatives.
Such thinking is indeed rational for small discrete problems.
Compartmentalization is necessary for managing competing demands on one’s time and attention.
But marginal thinking is inadequate for an all-consuming problem touching every aspect of society.
Economists also tend to equate rationality with precision.
The discipline’s power over public discourse and policymaking lies in its implicit claim that those who cannot compute precise benefits and costs are somehow irrational.
This allows economists – and their models – to ignore pervasive climate risks and uncertainties, including the possibility of climatic tipping points and societal responses to them.
And when one considers economists’ fixation with equilibrium models, the mismatch between the climate challenge and the discipline’s current tools becomes too glaring to ignore.
Yes, a return to equilibrium – getting “back to normal” – is an all-too-human preference.
But it is precisely the opposite of what is needed – rapidly phasing out fossil fuels – to stabilize the world’s climate.
These limitations are reflected in benefit-cost analyses of cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The traditional thinking suggests a go-slow path for cutting CO2.
The logic seems compelling: the cost of damage caused by climate change, after all, is incurred in the future, while the costs of climate action occur today.
The Nobel prize-winning verdict is that we should delay necessary investment in a low-carbon economy to avoid hurting the current high-carbon economy.
To be clear, a lot of new thinking has gone into showing that even this conventional logic would call for significantly more climate action now, because the costs are often overestimated while the potential (even if uncertain) benefits are underestimated.
The young researchers advancing this work must walk a near-impossible tightrope, because they cannot publish what they believe to be their best work (based on the most defensible assumptions) without invoking the outmoded neoclassical model to demonstrate the validity of new ideas.
The very structure of academic economics all but guarantees that marginal thinking continues to dominate.
The most effective way to introduce new ideas into the peer-reviewed academic literature is to follow something akin to an 80/20-rule: stick to the established script for the most part; but try to push the envelope by probing one dubious assumption at a time.
Needless to say, this makes it extremely difficult to change the overall frame of reference, even when those who helped establish the standard view are looking well beyond it themselves.
Consider the case of Kenneth J. Arrow, who shared a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1972 for showing how marginal actions taken by self-interested individuals can improve societal welfare.
That pioneering work cemented economists’ equilibrium thinking.
But Arrow lived for another 45 years, and he spent that time moving past his earlier work.
In the 1980s, for example, he was instrumental in founding the Santa Fe Institute, which is dedicated to what has since become known as complexity science – an attempt to move beyond the equilibrium mindset he had helped establish.
Because equilibrium thinking underpins the traditional climate-economic models that were developed in the 1990s, these models assume that there are tradeoffs between climate action and economic growth.
They imagine a world where the economy simply glides along a Panglossian path of progress. Climate policy might still be worthwhile, but only if we are willing to accept costs that will throw the economy off its chosen path.
Against the backdrop of this traditional view, recent pronouncements by the International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency are nothing short of revolutionary.
Both institutions have now concluded that ambitious climate action leads to higher growth and more jobs even in the near term.
The logic is straightforward: climate policies create many more jobs in clean-energy sectors than are lost in fossil-fuel sectors, reminding us that investment is the flipside of cost.
That is why the proposal for a $2 trillion infrastructure package in the United States could be expected to spur higher net economic activity and employment.
Perhaps more surprising is the finding that carbon pricing alone appears to reduce emissions without hurting jobs or overall economic growth.
The problem with carbon taxes or emissions trading is that real-world policies are not reducing emissions fast enough and therefore will need to be buttressed by regulation.
There is no excuse for continuing to adhere to an intellectual paradigm that has served us so badly for so long.
The standard models have been used to reject policies that would have helped turn the tide many years ago, back when the climate crisis still could have been addressed with marginal changes to the existing economic system.
Now, we no longer have the luxury of being able to settle for incremental change.
The good news is that rapid change is happening on the political front, owing not least to the shrinking cost of climate action.
The bad news is that the framework of neoclassical economics is still blocking progress.
The discipline is long overdue for its own tipping point toward new modes of thinking commensurate with the climate challenge.

Are We Five Years Wiser?
As the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda approaches, we should take the opportunity to assess the results of the response by the US and the international community.
The attacks and the response to them have obviously brought about a sea change in international relations, but it would be difficult to argue that further atrocities have become less likely as a result.
Why are we no more secure than we were five years ago?
Within a week of the attacks, President George W. Bush declared a “war on terrorism.”
The metaphor of war has the singular advantage that it clearly and strongly evokes the intensity of the counterattack that was called for.
Moreover, the metaphor of war constitutes an implicit appeal to intense mobilization, not only by a country that comes under attack, but also by its friends and allies.
Naturally, no one questions America’s right to defend itself.
The legitimacy of a violent counterattack has never been in doubt. But the war metaphor also carries inevitable connotations that, when applied to terrorism, are misleading and counterproductive.
Whenever war is invoked, it implies a fight against nations, peoples, or states.
It implies that whole territories and the populations living there are to be considered hostile.
War implies armies and command structures that can be recognized, if not clearly known; in any case, war entails a military confrontation with an identifiable adversary .
On all of these points, the concept of war, to paraphrase US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, is not helpful.
Even if the scale of the September 11 attack was of such a dimension that only the American army seemed able to face the challenge, in technical terms dealing with a threat that is extra-national rather than international is a matter of police techniques, not military tactics.
The negative consequences of this mistaken vision very quickly became apparent.
It is now widely known that the US government, perhaps partly unconsciously, embraced a deeply distorted image of al-Qaeda that portrayed it as a hierarchical organization with a seamless command structure – the prototype of a foe that the American army could attack and destroy.
But al-Qaeda – the word means “the base” or “the camp,” that is, nothing more or less than a point of gathering and training – is more like a blurred sphere of influence, comprising individuals and small local cells that act on their own initiative and cooperate very rarely, and only for large-scale operations.
It has not been proved that the attacks in London, Madrid, or Bali in the years since the September 11 plot, or the attack on America’s warship the USS Cole in 2000, reflected the existence of a “center” that coordinated the operations or gave orders to carry them out.
It is also wrong to conflate Islamic terrorism with that of the Basque ETA, Sri Lanka’s Tamil Tigers, or the Irish Republican Army.
Whereas these groups have a territorial base and are preoccupied with national aims, Islamic terrorism appears to be the work of a very small number of individuals who seek to avenge the centuries-long “humiliation” of the Muslim world, brought about by colonization, absence of economic development, and political weakness.
The goal of Islamic terrorists is nothing less than the destruction of the “hegemonic” Western world, despite most Muslim nations’ desire to live in peace within the international community and to cooperate in crafting effective development strategies.
The only viable strategy for confronting the threat of Islamic terrorism was, and continues to be, a search for agreement among Muslims, and among the leaders of Muslim nations, on the forms of mutual cooperation, including police cooperation, that are needed to isolate, weaken, or destroy the militants in their midst.
This is a long and difficult enterprise, but there remains no alternative.
Instead, the war metaphor continues to define the US response and that of several of America’s allies.
The attraction of this metaphor may be attributable to the excessive trust that Americans place not only in their army, which is understandable, but in force in general, which is much less understandable in the case of an intelligent people.
Whatever the case, casting the fight against terrorism as a war has led American policymakers to multiply violent military operations that have absolutely no chance of winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world. Quite the contrary.
Afghanistan was the only case where a military response was understandable: its government had, after all, given al-Qaeda a temporary territorial home. But to implicate Iraq, which had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or the September 11 attacks, was a huge mistake, one that has strengthened Islamic extremists and has probably helped them recruit terrorists.
Moreover, the US response has strengthened Israel’s belief in the effectiveness of military methods, leading to the recent war in Lebanon and the ongoing invasion of Gaza.
Powerless, the international community does nothing.
The rigidity and brutality of America’s behavior – resulting in many times more civilian deaths than occurred on September 11 – have blocked any useful intervention by countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates.
Likewise, the appeal of war has ruled out the prospect of serious negotiations between Israel, Syria, and Lebanon.
By attacking one Muslim country after another, the US and its allies have created the impression that Islam itself is the enemy, leading inexorably to the “clash of civilizations” that America says it wants to avoid.
But America’s strategy has failed.
Force cannot accomplish everything.
The international community must say clearly that Islam is not our enemy and that terrorism must be fought in other ways.
Muslim political leaders, for their part, should declare just as openly that terrorism is not their choice.
If both sides can stifle their murderous deviances, the hope of cultural and political reconciliation will be reborn.

Ukraine and the Fundamentals of European Security
MADRID – Europe has a security framework like no other, embodied in an intricate web of treaties, rules, and institutions.
Despite its sophistication, the European security order is not a finished product, but one that is constantly under revision.
Europe’s security arrangements have been built up gradually, over the course of several decades.
The foundations were laid at the 1945 Yalta Conference, where US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin reorganized Europe by dividing the region into spheres of influence, placing Europe’s security posture on a more stable and predictable footing.
Three decades later, in 1975, the Helsinki Summit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe helped to ease Cold War tensions.
In the 1990s, the Conference was institutionalized as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
Despite these vital agreements, the fall of the Soviet Union shook Europe to its core.
The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was aware of the changes that Russia would confront in the coming decades. “We live in a new world,” he declared in the speech that officially dissolved the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991.
Between 1989 and 1991, the Kremlin lost control over an expanse of territory larger than the European Union.
In the “new world” that Gorbachev referred to, one part of this lost territory has occupied a singular position in Russian leaders’ hearts and minds: Ukraine.
Yevgeny Primakov – who was Russia’s foreign minister when I, as NATO Secretary General, negotiated the agreement that enabled the Alliance’s first expansion after the Cold War’s end – often repeated to me, “Ukraine is in my heart.”
The founding act on mutual relations between the Alliance and Russia was signed in May 1997.
At the NATO summit in Madrid about six weeks later, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic were invited to join. As for Ukraine, it signed the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership with NATO.
It would not join the Alliance, but would become a privileged interlocutor with the West.
After all, Ukraine is also vital to European security.
At the time of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, I was in Crimea at a European Union summit with then-Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
With the tragic news, the world turned in solidarity to America, but Ukraine remained high on the European security agenda.
New threats emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first century, and over time, Russia became increasingly uncomfortable with the post-Cold War order, led by a hegemonic US.
As Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, “the unipolar model is not only unacceptable, but also impossible in today’s world.”
The rearrangement of the post-Soviet space was particularly disruptive for Russian foreign policy, which has a territorial conception of power. The progressive reduction of Russia’s territorial buffer – formed by countries over which it exerted powerful influence or outright control – left the Kremlin feeling cornered.
Against this backdrop, the prospect of losing Ukraine is even more unacceptable than a unipolar world order – which explains Russia’s massive deployment of troops along the countries’ long border.
Russia does not seem poised to attempt to annex all of Ukraine. Nonetheless, the Kremlin is clearly committed to keeping Ukraine within its sphere of influence.
A fundamental part of the European security order is its founding principles, and Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 clearly violated these – particularly, respect for states’ territorial integrity.
Unfortunately, the current tense situation along the Ukrainian border puts stability in Ukraine, and thus security in Europe, at risk.
Efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis are clearly urgent, and many have been undertaken over the past few weeks.
But while Russia is engaging in security talks with both the US and NATO, and participating in meetings within the OSCE framework, negotiations seem to be deadlocked.
The EU should support other efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the current crisis, such as the so-called Normandy format, an informal contact group comprising France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine that was created in 2014 to resolve the crisis in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.
But even as this process moves forward, the EU must ensure that its voice is heard, and that it is represented adequately in these negotiations.
As the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, has rightly pointed out, the Union “cannot be a neutral spectator” in talks concerning issues that directly affect European security.
Given US President Joe Biden’s stated commitment to the principle of “nothing about you without you,” it seems that Borrell’s sentiment is shared across the Atlantic.
Beyond principles are practical considerations. The EU has changed profoundly since the post-Cold War European security architecture was built.
It has expanded from 12 members to 27, becoming the world’s largest commercial bloc.
And, with the European Common Foreign and Security Policy, it has accumulated all the tools of an efficient foreign policy.
Now, it just needs to apply them.
Gorbachev said at the end of the Cold War that the world had changed.
Europe also has changed, and to uphold its commitment to peace, the European security architecture will have to reflect this new reality.

Designing Vaccines for People, Not Profits
LONDON – Recent announcements of demonstrated efficacy in COVID-19 vaccine trials have brought hope that a return to normality is in sight.
The preliminary data for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s novel mRNA vaccines are highly encouraging, suggesting that their approval for emergency use is forthcoming.
And more recent news of effectiveness (albeit at a slightly lower rate) in a vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has fueled optimism that even more breakthroughs are on their way.
In theory, the arrival of a safe and effective vaccine would represent the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In reality, we are not even at the end of the beginning of delivering what is needed: a “people’s vaccine” that is equitably distributed and made freely available to all who need it.
To be sure, the work to create vaccines in a matter of months deserves praise.
Humanity has made a monumental technological leap forward.
But the springboard was decades of massive public investment in research and development.
Most of the leading vaccine candidates prime the immune system’s defenses against the viral “spike protein,” an approach made possible through years of research at the US National Institutes of Health.
More immediately, BioNTech has received $445 million from the German government, and Moderna has received $1 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and more than $1 billion from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has received more than £1 billion ($1.3 billion) of public funding.
But for technological advances to translate into Health for All, innovations that are created collectively should be governed in the public interest, not for private profit.
This is especially true when it comes to developing, manufacturing, and distributing a vaccine in the context of a pandemic.
No country acting alone can resolve this crisis.
That is why we need vaccines that are universally and freely available.
And yet, the current innovation system prioritizes the interests of high-income countries over those of everyone else, and profits over public health.
The first step toward a people’s vaccine is to ensure full transparency of the clinical-trial results, which would enable independent and timely assessments of safety and efficacy.
The publication of scanty, preliminary data through corporate press releases is meant for financial markets, not the public-health community. This practice sets a bad precedent.
While pharmaceutical share prices surge, health professionals and the public are left second-guessing the reported results.
As more details about the flaws in clinical trial design and implementation for the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine emerge, so do the calls for open science and immediate sharing of protocols and results.
In addition, critical questions about the leading vaccine candidates remain unanswered.
Responding to political and economic pressure in high-income countries, pharmaceutical companies are rushing their vaccine candidates across the finish line.
Accordingly, they have designed their phase-three clinical trials to deliver the quickest possible positive read-out, rather than addressing more relevant questions such as whether the vaccine prevents infection or just protects against the disease.
It also is unclear how long the protection will last; whether a given vaccine works equally well in young and old people, or in people with co-morbidities; and how the top candidates compare to one another (critical for designing effective vaccination strategies).
Moreover, national interests – especially those of developed countries – remain the dominant factor in vaccine rollout.
While the international purchase and distribution platform COVAX represents a momentous step forward, its impact is being offset by massive bilateral advance-purchase agreements by rich countries that can afford to bet on multiple vaccines.
For example, high-income countries have already bought close to 80% of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine doses that will be available within the first year.
All told, rich countries have laid claim to 3.8 billion doses from different vaccine makers, compared to 3.2 billion (which includes around 700 million doses for COVAX) for the rest of the world combined.
In other words, high-income countries have pre-ordered enough doses to cover their populations several times over, leaving the rest of the world with potentially too few to cover even their most at-risk communities.
At the same time, because the vaccine race is focused primarily on Western markets, some candidates are scarcely viable outside of a developed-country context.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be kept at -70ºC, which is colder than an Antarctic winter.
Distributing this vaccine will create costly and complex logistical challenges, especially for low- and middle-income countries.
Although other candidates – such as the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine – are stable at higher temperatures, it is notable that such glaring features of market discrimination are built into the first product to reach the approval stage.
Beyond national interest lurks the problem of even narrower private interests, which stem from an over-financialized biopharmaceutical innovation model.
The business model for future vaccine development is already being sized up now that the pandemic has revealed the potential windfall for investors.
But while they benefit from sky-rocketing stock prices, soaring capital gains, and dumping a company’s shares the same day it announces promising preliminary results in a clinical trial, delivering a people’s vaccine has become an afterthought.
The COVID-19 crisis is a perfect test of whether a more public-health-oriented approach to innovation and production will prevail in the years ahead.
While Pfizer is sticking with the model of maximizing shareholder value, AstraZeneca has at least pledged not to profit from its vaccine “during the pandemic.”
Yet, despite all the public investment that underwrote these innovations, the process will remain opaque, leaving one to wonder if AstraZeneca is actually ready to prioritize public health over profit and offer its vaccine at cost.
While the recent vaccine news has brought hope, it also has exposed the pharmaceutical industry’s broken business model, casting doubt on the prospects of delivering a people’s vaccine and achieving Health for All.
Business as usual may allow us to scrape by in this crisis. But there is a better way to do things.
Before the next pandemic arrives, we must recognize vaccines as global health commons, and start to reorient the innovation system toward symbiotic public-private partnerships governed in the public interest.

Decoding Currency Crises
SANTIAGO – Imagine two countries. Country A has a fiscal deficit of slightly over 5% of GDP, while country B shows a gaping hole of nearly 9%.
Moreover, until recently A’s public debt barely exceeded 50% of GDP, while B’s public debt has been shooting up and will soon reach 90% of domestic output.
Of the two, B is more likely to suffer a currency crisis, right?
Not quite.
A is Argentina, and B is Brazil.
Since the beginning of 2018, the Argentine peso has lost half of its value.
Nearly out of foreign exchange, Argentina had to adopt austerity measures to secure a $50 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund – and not even that has calmed investors.
Meanwhile, the Brazilian real has weakened, mostly in response to the uncertain outcome of the October presidential election, but no obvious financial crunch looms.
The conventional wisdom is that Argentina is in trouble, and Brazil is not, because of their different current-account positions: at the end of 2017, Argentina showed a deficit of nearly 5% of GDP, in contrast to Brazil’s near-balance.
Because Brazil does not have to rely on foreign lenders, the logic goes, financial markets barely shrug even when politicians make wild campaign promises.
This must be right, one is tempted to conclude.
The sudden stop on international capital flows requires Argentina to slash imports and boost exports overnight, which means the currency must drop sharply.
But that is not the end of the story.
Recall that the current account is the difference between what a country invests and what it saves.
Argentina’s deficit reveals that it invests in productive capacity more than its government and private sector save – 19% versus 14% of GDP.
In contrast, Brazil’s balanced current account, coupled with its nearly 9%-of-GDP fiscal deficit, means that Brazilian firms and households must have a surplus of exactly the same 9% of GDP.
Put differently, the Brazilian private sector prefers investing in government bonds to investing in fixed capital.
Because Brazil’s government invests little, overall Brazilian investment, at barely 15% of GDP, is puny.
(Neighboring Chile invests 23% of GDP, while India and China invest 33% and 44%, respectively.)
So which country should lenders consider safer, the one that devotes nearly one-fifth of its annual resources to increasing production (and hence future repayment capacity), or the one that invests considerably less?
Brazilians can debate endlessly whether the generous government pensions that explain a good chunk of the fiscal deficit are just or unjust, but one thing is clear: having better-off retirees today does nothing to ensure that Brazil will have the wherewithal to pay its debts tomorrow.
So why don’t markets take this into account?
Shouldn’t they be fretting over Brazil and leave poor Argentina alone for once?
Here the conventional wisdom mounts its next line of defense: Brazil is sitting on $360 billion of reserves, while Argentina barely has $50 billion or so, plus the undisbursed portion of the IMF loan.
But so what?
Both countries have floating exchange rates, meaning their central banks are not supposed to intervene in the currency market by buying and selling reserves.
More fundamentally, why do we think of reserves differently than we think about other assets on national balance sheets?
Suppose Ilan Goldfajn, Brazil’s star central banker, issues a bond in New York and uses the dollar proceeds to enlarge the country’s international reserves.
At best, market participants will applaud the decision; at worst, they will be indifferent, because Brazil’s net debt position will not have changed.
Now suppose one of Argentina’s private agricultural exporters also issues an international bond and uses the dollars to enlarge one of its modern, highly competitive dairy plants, in order to sell more powdered milk to Asia.
Equity analysts may cheer the move, but macro wonks will fret if they see many deals like this one, because Argentina’s net debt position would deteriorate.
The difference, of course, is that convention allows analysts to subtract one kind of asset (international reserves) but not another (the new dairy plant) when calculating a country’s net debt.
The standard explanation is that the dairy plant is less liquid than reserves, which can be turned into cash with a single keystroke.
But, given well-functioning financial markets and a strong legal system, the dairy plant could also be quickly mortgaged and turned into cash.
Moreover, the plant will generate a hefty flow of liquid dollars in the future (implying a high rate of return), while the international reserves will likely yield very little (or could even have a negative rate of return when deposited abroad).
And that which makes you more liquid today can also make you less liquid tomorrow.
In response to market pressure, Argentina is now canceling much-needed infrastructure investment.
That will save dollars in the short run but leave the country less able to generate dollars in the medium term.
The upshot is that conventions to measure how indebted or how liquid a country is can be quite arbitrary.
And, crucially, liquidity is endogenous: it can be created at times of optimism and destroyed instantaneously when confidence collapses.
Bonds, stocks, and even dairy plants are highly liquid when everyone wants to buy them; the opposite is true when they are being dumped in the midst of a fire sale.
So liquidity crises can arrive unexpectedly, and for reasons often unrelated to underlying economic conditions.
Argentina chose a path of gradual fiscal adjustment and became the darling of the markets – until suddenly it wasn’t.
True, a couple of misguided moves by the central bank helped undermine confidence.
But any other factor (for example, contagion from Turkey) could have triggered the attack on the peso.
The fire-and-brimstone language so often used to describe emerging-market crises (“virtuous” versus “profligate” countries, for example) is not appropriate, because, as we have seen, the improvident yet liquid need not be punished for their supposed sins – while the thrifty but illiquid can be.
A more useful lesson is that countries should not put themselves in a position that allows liquidity concerns to override all other issues.
Argentina’s gradual adjustment path seemed plausible, except that eventually it left the country susceptible to liquidity logic (or illogic).
Last but not least, there is something amiss with international financial arrangements that expose so many countries, so often, to self-fulfilling liquidity crunches.
Do we need more equity and less debt?
More “build, operate, and transfer” schemes for infrastructure and fewer bond-financed projects?
A global lender of last resort in dollars that is bigger and faster than the IMF?
Europe’s financial crisis abated when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi vowed to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro.
Who will play Draghi’s role in Argentina?

Europe’s Energy Myopia
MADRID – As summer turns to autumn in Europe, the stakes of the continent’s energy crisis are rising fast, with no end in sight.
While the proximate cause of the current price spike is the war in Ukraine, its roots run much deeper.
In fact, it was the inevitable result of European inaction and tunnel vision – specifically, its failure to build a true energy union and its single-minded focus on implementing the European Green Deal.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had a unifying effect on the European Union.
It also helped to revive a transatlantic relationship that had been weakened not only by Donald Trump’s presidency, but also by America’s unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan and formation of the AUKUS defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom (a slap in the face to France).
Today, the EU-US relationship is the strongest it has been in six years.
On the energy front, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was set to carry Russian gas directly to Germany, appears to be dead in the water.
Even the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been shut down, at least for now, after more than a decade in operation.
The EU has set its sights on the long-unthinkable – and possibly unfeasible – goal of completely ending its dependence on Russian gas.
The scale of that task was made apparent by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent State of the Union address, which proposed a number of sweeping energy measures but stopped short of imposing a price cap on Russian gas imports.
An accelerated shift toward renewables is supposed to advance this goal.
But the race to find alternatives to Russian gas has also brought less climate-friendly changes, including a resurgence in the use of coal.
None of this has stemmed the rise in energy prices, which is contributing substantially to economic uncertainty in Europe.
Despite these challenges, a unified approach to tackling the energy crisis – let alone creating an energy union – is nowhere to be found.
French President Emmanuel Macron’s stonewalling on the completion of the Midi-Catalonia (MidCat) pipeline, which would transport gas from Algeria through Spain to the rest of the EU, reflects the myopic perspective that continues to hamper progress.
The MidCat project has the support of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
It even made an appearance in REPowerEU – the roadmap for reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels – as one of three “existing projects of common interest” the European Commission pledged to “support and encourage.”
Yet, even as he calls for “European solidarity,” Macron insists that the pipeline will “not solve the European gas problem.”
Addressing the French parliament this week, French Energy Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher echoed Macron’s sentiment, claiming that MidCat did not represent an “element of resilience in the current energy crisis.”
The real reason for this opposition, however, probably lies at home.
Like the rest of Europe, France is facing rising inflation, fueled by soaring energy prices.
But the pressure on France has been compounded by the loss of energy from half of its 56 nuclear reactors, which have gone offline for maintenance and investigations into corrosion issues.
Those reactors previously provided roughly two-thirds of France’s electricity, and enabled France to become Europe’s largest energy exporter over the past decade.
This has left France vulnerable.
According to one recent poll, only 51% of the French believe their president is “up to the task” of the moment.
By rejecting MidCat, Macron may be attempting to protect France’s battered energy system – and his own political position.
Ultimately, however, Macron’s arguments against the pipeline are unconvincing.
For starters, he claims that the two existing gas pipelines between France and Spain are underused, having operated at 53% of their capacity since February.
But, according to sources in the sector, those pipelines have operated at full capacity more than 20% of the time since March.
In any case, energy infrastructure should have sufficient capacity to get us through unusually difficult times. Otherwise, shortages are inevitable.
Macron also argues that completing the MidCat pipeline would take too long to make any difference in addressing the current crisis.
But that is dangerously short-term thinking.
High gas prices are not going away any time soon, even on the most conservative projections.
Finally, Macron argues that MidCat is incompatible with the EU’s environmental goals.
But the pipeline would neither lock Europe into gas nor become obsolete.
Instead, it could be repurposed to transport hydrogen – widely expected to be, in von der Leyen’s words, a “game-changer” for Europe.
REPowerEU promotes investment in “hydrogen-ready infrastructure” to connect the Iberian Peninsula (recognized as a future energy hub) with the European grid and to harness the “long-term potential for renewable hydrogen.”
Current science suggests this goal is more than just a pipe dream: transporting hydrogen by pipeline is not only feasible, but in fact presents a much more efficient option, in terms of both energy conservation and cost, than transport by high-tension wires.
Macron is hardly the first EU leader to maintain an every-country-for-itself mentality, even as he publicly pushes for solidarity to overcome shared challenges.
This tension was evident just last week at the Extraordinary Session of the Energy Council, which resulted in nothing more than kicking the can down the road.
The current crisis should serve as a wake-up call.
The EU must uphold principles of its energy policy – security of supply and affordability – that it long took for granted as it focused exclusively on sustainability.
And it must reinvigorate progress toward energy union.
Each EU member will continue to pursue the energy mix that best serves its national interests.
But nothing would serve European countries’ national energy interests better than unity.

Austerity in Small Places
BRUSSELS – Interest in small countries’ economic policies is usually confined to a small number of specialists.
But there are times when small countries’ experiences are interpreted around the world as proof that a certain policy approach works best.
Nowadays, Greece, the Baltic states, and Iceland are often invoked to argue for or against austerity.
For example, the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman argues that the fact that Latvian GDP is still more than 10% below its pre-crisis peak shows that the “austerity-cum-wage depression” approach does not work, and that Iceland, which was not subject to externally imposed austerity and devalued its currency, seems to be much better off.
Others, however, have noted that Estonia pursued strict austerity in the wake of the crisis, avoided a financial crisis, and is now growing again vigorously, whereas Greece, which delayed its fiscal adjustment for too long, experienced a deep crisis and remains mired in recession.
Both sides in these disputes usually omit to mention the key idiosyncratic characteristics and specific starting conditions that can make direct comparisons meaningless.
For starters, Latvia, like the other Baltic states, was running an enormous current-account deficit when the crisis started.
This implies that the pre-crisis level of GDP simply was not sustainable, as it required capital inflows in excess of 20% of GDP to finance outsize consumption and construction booms.
Thus, when the inflows stopped at the onset of the financial crisis, it became inevitable that GDP would contract by double-digit percentages.
Seen in this light, it is not at all surprising that Latvia’s GDP is now still more than 10% below its pre-crisis peak; after all, no country can run a current-account deficit of 25% of GDP forever.
Any comparison of the Baltics with the Great Depression (or the United States today) is thus meaningless.
The Baltics simply had to adjust to a sudden stop in external financing.
That was not the problem of the US during the 1930’s; nor is it America’s problem today.
A better way to judge post-crisis performance is to look at the output gap – that is, actual GDP relative to potential GDP.
According to a European Commission estimate, Latvian GDP was almost 14% above potential at the peak of the boom, then fell to 10% below potential when the boom went bust.
The recovery, however, was equally rapid, with GDP now back to potential (albeit below the unsustainable peak of the boom).
Latvia’s government increased taxes during the bust to keep revenues roughly constant as a share of GDP, but a sizeable fiscal deficit emerged nonetheless as social-security expenditure, such as unemployment benefits, soared while demand and output collapsed.
With a V-shaped recovery, however, this expenditure fell again, reducing the deficit rapidly.
The recovery could only be partial, because the previous level of output was unsustainable, but it was enough to allow the government to balance its books again.
Thus, Latvia today enjoys a sustainable fiscal position, with output close to its potential and growing.
Austerity might have worsened the slump temporarily, but it did deliver fiscal sustainability without permanent damage to the economy.
By contrast, output in Greece, which was slow to adopt austerity, is still 12% below its estimated potential and continues to fall.
Does Iceland constitute a counter-example to Latvia?
After all, its GDP fell much less, although it ran similarly large current-account deficits before the crisis – and ran much larger fiscal deficits for longer.
In contrast to Latvia, Iceland let its currency, the krona, devalue massively.
But, the devaluation was much less important than is widely assumed.
While exports did indeed perform very well, Iceland’s main exports are natural resources (fish and aluminum), demand for which held up well during the post-2008 global crisis.
That sustained demand provided an important stabilizer for the domestic economy, which the Baltic states did not have.
Indeed, Latvia was particularly hard hit by the slump in global trade in 2008-2009, given its dependence on exports.
Iceland’s superior economic performance should thus not be attributed to the devaluation of the krona, but rather to global warming, which pushed the herring farther North, into Icelandic waters.
Nor is Iceland a poster child for the claim that avoiding austerity works.
In small, open economies, higher deficits are unlikely to sustain domestic output, because most additional expenditure goes toward imports.
So it is not surprising that, despite its large devaluation, Iceland continues to run a high current-account deficit, adding to its already-large foreign debt.
Moreover, Iceland’s public debt/GDP ratio now stands at 100%, compared to only 42% in Latvia.
Part of the difference, of course, reflects different starting conditions and the cost of bank rescues.
But there can be no doubt that, by keeping deficits under control, Latvia’s public finances are in much better shape today, with debt sustainability no longer a problem.
By contrast, Iceland’s debt has become so large that it is likely to constrain future growth.
One must be careful when attempting to draw lessons from the experience of small countries that sometimes have very particular characteristics.
The one conclusion that appears to hold generally is that shunning austerity does not allow one to avoid the problem of achieving both fiscal and external sustainability.

Preventing Toxic Stress in Children
Cambridge – What if political leaders around the world could improve school achievement and job readiness, reduce crime, and extend healthy life expectancy – but the results would not be seen until after they left public office?
Would they have the political courage to act now in the best long-term interest of their people? Or would they become mired in ineffective, poorly-funded attempts to obtain quick results, and then say it couldn’t be done?
Thanks to a remarkable convergence of new scientific knowledge about the developing brain, the human genome, and the effects of early experiences on later learning, behavior, and health, these are not hypothetical questions.
We have the knowledge to secure our future by improving the life prospects of all our young children.
What is needed now is political vision and leadership.
Scientists can now credibly say that the early childhood years – from birth to age 5 – lay the foundation for later economic productivity, responsible citizenship, and a lifetime of sound physical and mental health.
Conversely, deep poverty, abuse, neglect, and exposure to violence in early childhood can all lead to toxic stress.
In contrast to normal or tolerable stress, which can build resilience and properly calibrate a child’s stress-response system, toxic stress is caused by extreme, prolonged adversity in the absence of a supportive network of adults to help the child adapt.
When it occurs, toxic stress can actually damage the architecture of the developing brain, leading to disrupted circuits and a weakened foundation for future learning and health.
The lasting, neurobiological effect on young children who experience toxic stress leads to a far greater likelihood of anti-social behavior, lower achievement in school and at work, and poor physical and mental health – all of which society addresses at great cost.
Deep poverty is but one risk factor for toxic stress and its long-term consequences.
The greatest harm comes from the cumulative burden of multiple risk factors, including neglect, abuse, parental substance abuse or mental illness, and exposure to violence.
With each additional risk factor, the odds of long-term damage to brain architecture increase.
Neuroscience and the biology of stress help us to begin to understand how poverty and other adversities are literally built into our bodies.
Prolonged activation of the body’s stress system during early development can damage the formation of the neural connections that comprise our brain architecture and set our stress-response system at a hair-trigger level.
We can thus comprehend why children born into such circumstances have more problems in school, are more likely to commit crimes, and are more prone to heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other physical and mental illnesses later in life.
By addressing the circumstances that can produce toxic stress – always asking, “How can we best protect our children?” – local, national, and global leaders would improve not only the life prospects of their youngest citizens, but also outcomes for their societies.
A wide range of policies and practices that support positive relationships and quality learning experiences – at home, in early care and education programs, and through targeted interventions – can have a positive impact if based on solid evidence and matched to the specific needs they are expected to address.
Beyond their short-term benefits to individuals, extensive economic analysis also has demonstrated significant financial benefits to society for years to come.
Science points to three things that we can do to level the playing field:
· Make basic medical services and early care and education available to all young children;
· Provide greater financial support and rich learning experiences for young children living in poverty; and
· Offer specialized services for young children experiencing toxic stress from difficult life circumstances.
The scientific principles of early childhood development do not vary by family income, program type, or funding source.
In advanced countries, programs that screen for adversity and respond to the specific health and developmental needs of individual children and families can yield benefits that far exceed their costs.
In developing countries, shifting the focus of international investments from an exclusive focus on child survival to an integrated approach to early childhood health and development offers greater promise than addressing either domain alone.
Children burdened by significant economic insecurity, discrimination, or maltreatment benefit most from effective interventions.
Neuroscience, child development, and the economics of human capital formation all point to the same conclusion: creating the right conditions for early childhood development is far more effective than trying to fix problems later.
Finally, leadership is about more than smart economic decisions.
It is also about moral responsibility, wisdom, judgment and courage – and about leveraging knowledge to promote positive social change.
The negative consequences of poverty and other forms of adversity are not inevitable.
The gap between what we know and what we do is growing and increasingly unconscionable. The time for leadership on behalf of vulnerable children is now.

Why the Plastic Crisis Matters
MANILA – Plastics have become a hot topic.
News stories about plastic on beaches and in the oceans abound, and policymakers have begun to respond with bans or limitations on plastic bags and single-use plastic items.
But the plastics industry is fighting back, arguing that plastics are indispensable, and that the real problem is littering consumers and poor waste-management systems.
According to the industry’s talking points, bedridden hospital patients and the elderly depend on bendy straws, and phasing out shrink-wrap on vegetables will lead to a food-spoilage disaster.
No one doubts that waste management in much of the developing world – and even in many richer countries – needs to be improved.
Governments urgently need to invest in better waste-collection and processing systems.
But the rich world also must stop exporting its worthless plastic waste to poor countries for so-called “recycling.”
All too often, the trash that Europeans and Americans sort and separate into different bins ends up in containers bound for Southeast Asia, to be picked up by underpaid workers in hazardous conditions.
Ultimately, much of it ends up in dumpsites or waterways anyway.
More to the point, the flood of plastic into our natural systems is linked directly to the other forces that are destroying our environment, decimating biodiversity, fueling climate change, and depleting natural resources.
That is the main finding of the Plastic Atlas, recently published by the Heinrich Böll Foundation and the Break Free From Plastic Movement.
As the Atlas – a compendium of facts, figures, and background information on the synthetic polymers that have become an integral part of our lives over the last 70 years – makes clear, the plastics industry has been selling us a false narrative.
The plastics crisis is much more than a waste-management problem.
The real story starts as soon as oil and gas are extracted from the ground, and continues long after plastic waste enters the ocean and other ecosystems.
Not only is plastic production a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions; it also releases a wide range of other chemicals into the environment, many of which end up in our lungs and stomachs.
Thus, while efforts to tackle waste are important, they must not distract attention from the main problem: the world is producing far too much plastic in the first place.
Between 1950 and 2017, around 9.2 billion tons of plastic were produced globally, which is equivalent to more than one ton per living person today.
Worse, over half of that plastic has been churned out since 2000, and the rate of production continues to accelerate, with no slowdown in sight.
According to recent estimates, plastic production and incineration could emit 56 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, accounting for 10-13% of the total carbon budget we can “spend” by mid-century under current emissions-reduction commitments.
By the end of the century, plastic-related emissions could amount to half the total carbon budget.
The climate crisis and the plastics crisis are two sides of the same coin.
To keep global warming within an acceptable range, we absolutely must reduce the amount of plastic we produce, consume, and discard.
And no, this is not a problem that we can recycle our way out of.
Less than 10% of all plastics ever produced have been recycled. In the case of the United States, under 10% of plastic waste is recycled; the rest is incinerated or dumped in landfills.
While better waste-management and more recycling are both imperative, the only real, lasting solution is to produce less plastic in the first place.
We must start by cutting down on the plastic packaging that accounts for 40% of all plastic waste.
The first step is to phase out single-use items such as plastic grocery and garbage bags, cutlery, and, yes, those wonderful bendy straws.
Humankind must find ways to get by without laying waste to the planet.
That means reducing, in absolute terms, the amount of material we use throughout the economy.
It also means halting the development of petrochemical facilities that produce plastics and other highly polluting materials.
More broadly, we must force manufacturers to change their distribution and delivery systems towards refillable and reusable systems, and to take responsibility for the damage their products cause.
Some of these measures are already being adopted.
In Asia, entire cities are moving toward zero-waste solutions through decentralized community-led and centered initiatives, bans on single-use plastics, and lobbying against waste incineration.
Many of the solutions remain to be discovered and developed; but Asia is proving to be the engine of change.
It is naming and shaming the corporations that churn out the most plastic. And it is pushing governments to ban fracking and drilling, mandate reduced production of plastic, and champion reuse and refill solutions.
If there is one thing that can stop the flood of plastic, it is greater accountability.
And accountability, in turn, relies on good data and information.
We must expose and publicize the truth about plastic, and counter the misleading narratives propagated by the plastics industry.
The Plastic Atlas represents an opportunity to turn the page.

Germany in the Age of Trump
BERLIN – Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States, and in his inaugural address he made it clear to the assembled US establishment that his administration does not intend to pursue business as usual.
His motto, “America first,” signals the renunciation, and possible destruction, of the US-led world order that Democratic and Republican presidents, starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt, have built up and maintained – albeit with varying degrees of success – for more than seven decades.
If America abandons its role as the leading economic and military power and moves toward nationalism and isolationism, it will precipitate an international reordering, while also changing the country itself.
Rather than being a hegemon, the US will become one great power among many.
Since the end of World War II, the US has been the engine of global free trade, so a move toward protectionism, or an attempt to either reverse globalization or harness it for narrow national interests, would have immense economic and political consequences worldwide.
The full implications of such a shift are largely unpredictable; but we all know – or should know – what happened the last time the world’s leading powers turned inward, in the 1930s.
The alliances, multilateral institutions, security guarantees, international agreements, and shared values underlying the current global order might soon be called into question, or rejected altogether.
If that happens, the old Pax Americana will have been needlessly destroyed by America itself.
And with no obvious alternative framework to replace it, all indicators point to turbulence and chaos in the near future.
America’s two former enemies, Germany and Japan, will be among the biggest losers if the US abdicates its global role under Trump.
Both countries experienced total defeat in 1945, and ever since they have rejected all forms of the Machtstaat,or “power state.”
With their security guaranteed by the US, they transformed themselves into trading countries, and have remained active participants in the US-led international system.
If Trump takes away the US security umbrella, these two major economic powers will have a serious security problem on their hands.
While Japan’s peripheral geopolitical position might, theoretically, allow it to re-nationalize its defense capacities, pursuing that option could significantly increase the likelihood of a military confrontation in East Asia. This is an alarming prospect, given that multiple countries in the region have nuclear weapons.
Germany, meanwhile, lies in the heart of Europe, and is surrounded by its previous wartime enemies.
It is the continent’s largest country in economic and demographic terms, but it owes much of its strength to the American security guarantee and multilateral, transatlantic, and European institutional frameworks based on shared values and free trade.
The existing international order has rendered the Machtstaat and its accompanying sphere of influence unnecessary.
Unlike Japan, Germany cannot re-nationalize its security policy even in theory, because such a step would undermine the principle of collective defense in Europe and tear apart the continent.
Lest we forget, the post-war global and regional order’s purpose was to integrate the former enemy powers so that they posed no danger to one another.
Owing to its geopolitical weight, Germany’s perspective is now synonymous with that of the European Union.
And the EU’s outlook is not that of a hegemon; rather, it is concerned with the rule of law, integration, and peaceful reconciliation of member states’ interests.
Germany’s location alone makes nationalism a bad idea; and besides, its most fundamental political and economic interests depend on a strong, successful EU – especially in the age of Trump.
Germany is in the same boat as all other Europeans with respect to security.
Just as there can be no French security without Germany, there can be no German security without Poland.
That is why Germany and all other European countries must now do all they can to boost their contributions to collective security within the EU and NATO.
Germany’s strength is based on its financial and economic might, and it will now have to leverage that strength on the EU’s and NATO’s behalf.
Unfortunately, it can no longer count on the so-called “peace dividend” that it enjoyed in the past (and even during the euro crisis).
Thrift is undoubtedly a virtue; but other considerations should take priority when one’s house is on fire and about to collapse.
Apart from security, Germany’s second fundamental interest is global free trade.
Intra-European trade will remain supremely important, because that is how Germany makes a living; but trade with the US will be vital, too.
It will not bode well for Germany if China and the US – its two most important non-EU export markets – enter into a trade war.
Protectionism anywhere can have global repercussions.
And yet, along with all the dangers Trump’s presidency poses for Europeans, it offers opportunities as well.
Trump’s protectionist rhetoric alone has already led to a rapprochement between China and Europe.
More important, the new US administration has furnished Europeans with a chance finally to close ranks, grow up, and reinforce their geopolitical power and position.
But if Europeans finally do come together, they should avoid anti-Americanism.
Trump is America’s president, but he is not America.
North Atlantic countries will still have a common history and shared values – even under Trump, and even though much else will change in the coming years.

Taming “Speculative Capitalism”
Nicolas Sarkozy, the leading contender in the French presidential election, recently lashed out against what he called “speculative capitalism,” and says he wants to “moralize the financial zone” created by the euro.
What does Sarkozy mean by “speculative capitalism?”
Something immoral, apparently, but what?
The term has rarely been used before, and seems to be redundant.
After all, capitalism is practically a synonym for speculation, isn’t it?
Sarkozy is expressing a wave of sentiment that is neither unique to his party nor to France.
At stake with his comments are emerging ideas and attitudes that will inform the twenty-first century economy.
So we should think hard about what “speculative capitalism” means.
Sarkozy has called free trade “a policy of naiveté,” and wants to take a number of steps that would stand in the way of economic globalization.
Although he does want to make the French labor market less rigid, he would block foreign takeover bids of French companies and protect Airbus workers from possible job losses.
Protecting France from speculative capitalism seems to mean interfering with free trade to protect local jobs.
To be sure, Sarkozy is right to note the enormous risks that workers and their communities face in this rapidly globalizing world.
But putting this problem center stage should not mean protecting existing jobs come what may.
Capitalists put their money where they think it can get the highest return; that is what we call speculation.
They buy companies, break them up, recombine them, fire some employees, and hire others.
To do this profitably, they cannot afford to let patriotism or sentiment interfere.
They do business in whatever country is most advantageous.
Rewarding successful ventures is the basic idea of capitalism – a dynamic process that Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.”
Under capitalism, one is immoral if one reneges on a contract or breaks the law, but not if one speculates.
Planned economies were never able to flourish because uncertainty about the future is just too high, something that is best left to the speculators, with the potential of reward if they are right and the disciplining whip of the market if they are wrong.
Concerns about free trade similar to Sarkozy’s are gaining strength around the world.
In an article last year in the US journal Foreign Affairs , Alan Blinder, a former advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice-Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, argued that the process of globalization has the potential to cause massive job loss in the future.
Given that electronic communications technology has a powerful potential to replace employees with others who are thousands of miles away, we may now be seeing only the beginning of this process.
Blinder is absolutely right that the problem could get worse.
Deniers of the problem – such as economist Jagdish Baghwati – cannot prove that the worst will not happen.
We ought to prepare for the possibility of massive turmoil in our economies in coming years, even if we cannot prove that it will happen, just as we should take steps against global warming, even if some scientists doubt that it is a problem.
According to Blinder, governments should encourage education for jobs that are harder to outsource overseas.
He wants the government to subsidize “personally-delivered service” jobs, which cannot be delivered over the Internet, to encourage the expansion of such jobs instead of “impersonally-delivered services.”
Subsidies, of course, interfere with free trade.
But Blinder’s solution appears to be a creative new idea, and one may think of legitimate justifications for the government to interfere with free markets this way.
His idea certainly is more focused and theoretically sound than Sarkozy’s plans to protect existing jobs.
In fact, Blinder’s proposal is only one of many possible government policies aimed at dealing with the Internet-age turmoil in the market for jobs and livelihoods.
Capitalist institutions include risk-management schemes that provide insurance, hedging, and diversification.
Government can promote the democratization of such institutions so that they protect people from the very risks that they are worrying most about.
Such possibilities include livelihood insurance, home equity insurance, income-linked loans, and GDP-linked and home-price-linked securities.
Moreover, government can make our social insurance (a government institution that complements private insurance) more incentive-compatible and better at managing risks – and not just the risks of the extreme losers – by, say, launching inequality-indexation of the tax system.
And governments should improve our information infrastructure, so that financial contracts can better capture the outcomes of economic risks.
So Sarkozy shouldn’t be lashing out against “speculative capitalism.”
On the contrary, he should be asking how capitalism can be developed even further, with new institutions in finance and insurance to deal with the very important problem that his campaign has highlighted.

Should We Talk About Race and Intelligence?
PRINCETON, NJ - The intersection of genetics and intelligence is an intellectual minefield.
Harvard’s former president Larry Summers touched off one explosion in 2005 when he tentatively suggested a genetic explanation for the difficulty his university had in recruiting female professors in math and physics.
(He did not suggest that men are on average more gifted in these fields than women, but that there is some reason for believing that men are more likely than women to be found at both the upper and lower ends of the spectrum of abilities in these fields – and Harvard, of course, only appoints people at the extreme upper end.)
Now one of the most eminent scientists of our time has blundered much more clumsily into the same minefield, with predictable results.
In October, James Watson, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for his description of the structure of DNA, was in London to promote his memoir, Avoid Boring People and Other Lessons From a Life in Science .
In an interview in the London Sunday Times , he was quoted as saying that he was gloomy about Africa’s prospects, because “All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really.”
He added that he hoped everyone was equal, but that “people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.”
Watson tried to clarify his remarks in a subsequent interview in The Independent, saying:
The overwhelming desire of society today is to assume that equal powers of reason are a universal heritage of humanity.
It may well be.
But simply wanting this to be the case is not enough.
This is not science.
To question this is not to give in to racism.
Watson is right that questioning this assumption is not, in itself, racist.
A racist has a negative attitude to people of a particular race.
There is nothing racist about trying to learn what the facts are.
What does raise the suspicion of racism, however, is propagating a negative view of the facts when that view lacks a solid scientific foundation.
That is precisely what Watson has now admitted he did.
Returning to New York, he apologized to those who had drawn from his remarks the implication that Africa is somehow “genetically inferior.”
This was not, he claimed, what he meant, and more importantly, “there is no scientific basis for such a belief.”
The retraction came too late.
The Science Museum cancelled a lecture Watson was to give about his book and his career.
Under pressure from the board, Watson resigned his position as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, an institution that under his leadership has become one of the world’s leading research and educational institutions in the biological sciences.
Rockefeller University also cancelled a lecture that Watson had been scheduled to give.
Putting aside the specific claims that Watson made in his Sunday Times interview, a genuinely difficult question remains: should scientists investigate the possibility of a link between race and intelligence?
Is the question too sensitive for science to explore?
Is the danger of misuse of the results of such research too great?
The dangers are obvious enough.
Racist stereotyping harms the prospects of many non-whites, especially those of African descent.
The concepts of intelligence and of race are less clear-cut than we often assume them to be.
Scientists need to handle them carefully if they are to pose meaningful questions about the point at which these two concepts intersect.
Some say that the tools we use to measure intelligence – IQ tests – are themselves culturally biased.
The late Stephen J. Gould, author of The Mismeasure of Man, dismissed cross-cultural research using IQ tests as an attempt by white men to show their superiority.
But if that was so, the attempt has backfired, because East Asians tend to score better than people of European descent.
On the other hand, it clearly is possible that differences in IQ scores between people living in impoverished countries and people living in affluent countries are affected by factors like education and nutrition in early childhood.
Controlling for these variables is difficult.
Yet to say that we should not carry out research in this area is equivalent to saying that we should reject open-minded investigation of the causes of inequalities in income, education, and health between people of different racial or ethnic groups.
When faced with such major social problems, a preference for ignorance over knowledge is difficult to defend.
In explaining why it was canceling Watson’s lecture, the Science Museum said that his remarks had gone “beyond the point of acceptable debate.”
It then struck a reasonable balance by inviting people who want to learn more about “the science behind genetics and race” to attend other upcoming events at the museum.
The speakers at these events will presumably have better credentials than Watson to discuss topics like race and intelligence.
If so, one can only hope that watching how Watson blew himself up will not discourage them from venturing into the minefield.
Finally, no matter what the facts on race and intelligence turn out to be, they will not justify racial hatred, nor disrespect for people of a different race.
Whether some are of higher or lower intelligence has nothing to do with that.

Ukraine and Beyond
GENEVA – The Ukraine crisis has evolved from acute to chronic.
The main question – Will Russia dare to invade mainland Ukraine? – has been answered: Not now.
So, now what?
Obviously, the Kremlin did not expect the West’s firm and united reaction to its annexation of Crimea.
President Vladimir Putin’s phone call to US President Barack Obama on March 28 clearly demonstrated Russia’s eagerness to discuss “de-escalation.”
Putin’s main objectives now are the removal of Ukraine’s blockade of Moldova’s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria and Ukrainian “federalization” (a euphemism for the Kremlin’s back-door strategy to gain control over the country’s eastern and southern regions).
But there can be no return to business as usual anytime soon.
Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea has triggered unintended tectonic shifts in international politics.
While the long-term implications are still hazy, the immediate consequences are clear.
First, the Russian people will pay dearly in terms of their own freedom for their leaders’ reckless decisions.
After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Russian poet Alexander Galich wrote: “Compatriots, our homeland is in danger!
Our tanks are in a foreign land!”
Confrontation with the West, seemingly unavoidable after the Crimea Anschluss, will give rise to a “mobilization” regime.
Russia’s new draft budget, with its skyrocketing military outlays, along with paranoid talk of “fifth columns” and “national traitors,” attests to this trend.
In such circumstances, sanctions that hit ordinary people will only help the regime consolidate its power.
Second, the crisis has several geopolitical ramifications.
The Kremlin’s actions have undermined European security; delivered a body blow to international law; weakened the nuclear non-proliferation regime by fatally undermining the role of security guarantees for non-nuclear states; and raised doubts about the predictability of Russia under its current leaders.
All of this will have far-reaching effects in the years and decades ahead, ranging from the realignment of formal and informal alliances and the militarization of security arrangements to possible – and long-discussed – adjustments in the international governance system.
Russia’s expulsion from the G-8 and renewed military build-ups are only the first of many such changes.
Third, the Ukraine crisis will completely transform Russia’s relations with the West.
During the first two decades after the Cold War, a combination of suspicion and pragmatism prevailed on both sides, with competition in some respects and cooperation in others playing a crucial role in coping with important international challenges.
The relationship’s transformation into an adversarial one will “contaminate” the international system, undermining potential solutionsto many problems, from nuclear-arms reduction and climate change to stabilizing regional hot spots like Syria.
In response to Western sanctions, the Kremlin will bring pressure to bear on the United States and its allies by creating problems elsewhere.
For example, Russia has already offered to build two new, non-military nuclear reactors in Iran.
Technological support for Iran’s nuclear programs could impede the ongoing international negotiations aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, especially as the Iranians are looking for leverage in the talks.
Russia could escalate the crisis by putting pressure on the US closer to home as well.
Consider Venezuela, where – as with Iran’s nuclear program – Russia has demonstrated its willingness to take risks that it would not have taken before.
On February 26, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu formally announced his government’s plan to expand its overseas military presence.
Venezuela is high on its list, having already purchased more than three-quarters of the $14.5 billion in arms sold by Russia in the region from 2001 to 2013.
Fourth, having annexed Crimea, Russia has lost Ukraine, turning it from friend to foe.
Ukraine’s industrial and manufacturing infrastructure evolved under the Soviet Union as a compliment to Russia’s resource base.
After the Soviet Union’s dissolution, the Russian resource economy’s traditional links with Ukraine, including extensive pipeline infrastructure, ensured access to European markets.
Now, having lost Ukraine’s industrial and manufacturing base, and with Europe more determined than ever to reduce its dependence on Russian energy supplies, the Kremlin will need to turn eastward toward China, which will be happy to see Russia remain a resource economy in thrall to it.
Given all of these potential dire consequences, it is vital to prevent Cold War II.
During the coming transition period, the world will need new mechanisms for international dialogue.
Isolation of Russia would be counterproductive, merely aggravating its highly developed sense of victimization and possibly turning it into a “rogue” state – truly a nightmare scenario, given that Russia has the world’s largest nuclear arsenal.
Instead, targeted economic sanctions and calibrated military measures should be coupled with intensive and open political dialogue.
A personal meeting between US, Russian, and German leaders could be helpful in channeling relations toward a non-destructive course.
To be truly productive, such contact should not be limited to resolving the Ukraine crisis – or to senior officials.
The Ukraine crisis should not be allowed to obscure the full range of challenges that the world faces.
In fact, the standoff is more likely to be resolved constructively within a framework that seeks consensus on a broader agenda.
After all, any crisis creates new opportunities (for example, the Syrian civil war has prompted important action on chemical weapons).
The opportunity for Russia and the West is to generate the political will needed to address issues – above all, reform of an outmoded system of international relations – that have been ignored for too long.

Global Health from the Ground Up
PARIS – While the end of the COVID-19 pandemic may be “in sight,” as the World Health Organization recently declared, the world faces numerous emerging health risks.
Some are exacerbated by climate change, others by travel, online misinformation, food scarcity, poverty, or wars.
Fortunately, the pandemic has taught us valuable lessons for managing these risks – and for helping vulnerable developing economies better prepare for future health crises.
The WHO’s Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT-A) Accelerator has been a massive global effort that facilitated testing, treatment, and vaccination worldwide.
But it is clear that ACT-A failed to address the longstanding structural obstacles that impeded vaccination rollouts in low- and middle-income countries.
Doing so requires a new framework that emphasizes local relationships with workers and entrepreneurs on the ground.
Developing countries have fewer health workers per capita than developed countries do.
Africa, Southeast Asia, the eastern Mediterranean, and parts of Latin America face a shortfall of 5.9 million nurses and 18 million health-care workers by 2030.
In 2019, 13.8 million infants worldwide did not benefit from routine immunization services, including 8.8 million from lower-income countries.
It is hardly surprising, then, that only 16% of people in low-income countries have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose as of May, even though global supply now far outstrips demand.
Pharmaceutical companies have a crucial role to play in overcoming the various obstacles to boosting vaccination rates in lower-income countries.
And, as we seek to ensure access for a broader array of treatments, the challenges extend beyond vaccinations.
Current efforts by several manufacturers, Sanofi among them, include providing a portfolio of essential medicines at cost.
For example, Sanofi’s Global Health Unit distributes 30 essential drugs – including insulin and treatments for cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, malaria, and cancer – to 40 developing countries.
But while reducing treatment costs is vitally important, the pandemic demonstrated the need for a more holistic approach that views medicine, health-care systems, and the global supply chain as interconnected challenges.
As COVID-19 showed, assistance that does not empower local capabilities can do more harm than good, which is why companies must go beyond merely providing financial aid.
To help improve access to health care in low- and middle-income countries, companies can tackle logistical and supply issues, use their data and analytics capabilities to assist frontline responders, and train local officials in innovative technologies.
Public-health experts around the world are increasingly focused on identifying and managing emerging diseases and hot spots and reshaping attitudes and behaviors, while technology facilitates the data collection and information-sharing needed to improve outcomes.
But gathering and assessing these data depends on collaboration with traditional and non-traditional partners.
Such efforts must move rapidly, be driven by local communities’ priorities, and build on shared data derived from diagnostics, tracking, and modeling.
During the pandemic, South Africa stood out for its prompt genomic sequencing, which involved cooperation among many actors and enabled the country to detect the Beta and Omicron variants early on.
Similarly, combining large data sets, computing power, and algorithms would allow public-health officials to monitor disease spread, material shortages, logistical challenges, and drug reactions.
Cloud technology facilitates data mining, information-sharing, and research and development, and enables us to identify disease outbreaks, new pathogens, and communities most in need of immediate help.
To this end, the global public-health community should work together to enable innovation and cultivate entrepreneurial ecosystems by focusing on local startups.
An Impact Fund to provide capital to local startups would need to be created, together with mechanisms for sharing skills and operational expertise. Sanofi Global Health’s $25 million Impact Fund, launched in July, is already supporting local innovators that are able to deliver scalable solutions for sustainable health care in underserved regions.
Given lower-income countries’ need for more medical workers, fostering local expertise is crucial.
In emerging markets, local medical professionals and supply-chain experts must train to become “expert generalists” who can address pressing public-health concerns and reduce barriers to care.
Here, technology can provide an alternative to in-person training, which is becoming more challenging to manage as a result of rising costs, ongoing political conflicts, travel restrictions, and labor shortages.
Sanofi, for example, is working together with Reach52, a tech platform from Singapore that offers rural districts health education, screening, and affordable medicines in one accessible subscription service.
Reach52’s platform relies on an “offline-first” approach for low-connectivity markets, enabling local aid workers to enroll residents in community-based screening sessions for diabetes and hypertension, conducted by nurses trained as “health coaches.”
Increasing access to health care in low-income countries in a meaningful way requires more than providing them with low-cost medicines.
We need a new framework of cooperation to address the myriad interconnected challenges we face as we adapt to new technologies and nurture local innovation.
As pharmaceutical companies, our job is to disrupt our own thinking and encourage on-the-ground innovators.
This multi-pronged approach must center on a sustainable, locally-driven care model designed to reach vulnerable populations.
As the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton wrote, aid that gives but does not strengthen is unhelpful – and can even hinder future gains.

The Allure and Limits of Monetized Fiscal Deficits
NEW YORK – A cloud of gloom hovered over the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting this month.
With the global economy experiencing a synchronized slowdown, any number of tail risks could bring on an outright recession. Among other things, investors and economic policymakers must worry about a renewed escalation in the Sino-American trade and technology war.
A military conflict between the United States and Iran would be felt globally. The same could be true of “hard” Brexit by the United Kingdom or a collision between the IMF and Argentina’s incoming Peronist government.
Still, some of these risks could become less likely over time.
The US and China have reached a tentative agreement on a “phase one” partial trade deal, and the US has suspended tariffs that were due to come into effect on October 15.
If the negotiations continue, damaging tariffs on Chinese consumer goods scheduled for December 15 could also be postponed or suspended.
The US has also so far refrained from responding directly to Iran’s alleged downing of a US drone and attack on Saudi oil facilities in recent months.
US President Donald Trump doubtless is aware that a spike in oil prices stemming from a military conflict would seriously damage his re-election prospects next November.
The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a tentative agreement for a “soft” Brexit, and the UK Parliament has taken steps at least to prevent a no-deal departure from the EU.
But the saga will continue, most likely with another extension of the Brexit deadline and a general election at some point.
Finally, in Argentina, assuming that the new government and the IMF already recognize that they need each other, the threat of mutual assured destruction could lead to a compromise.
Meanwhile, financial markets have been reacting positively to the reduction of global tail risks and a further easing of monetary policy by major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the People’s Bank of China.
Yet it is still only a matter of time before some shock triggers a new recession, possibly followed by a financial crisis, owing to the large build-up of public and private debt globally.
What will policymakers do when that happens?
One increasingly popular view is that they will find themselves low on ammunition.
Budget deficits and public debts are already high around the world, and monetary policy is reaching its limits.
Japan, the eurozone, and a few other smaller advanced economies already have negative policy rates, and are still conducting quantitative and credit easing.
Even the Fed is cutting rates and implementing a backdoor QE program, through its backstopping of repo (short-term borrowing) markets.
But it is naive to think that policymakers would simply allow a wave of “creative destruction” that liquidates every zombie firm, bank, and sovereign entity.
They will be under intense political pressure to prevent a full-scale depression and the onset of deflation.
If anything, then, another downturn will invite even more “crazy” and unconventional policies than what we’ve seen thus far.
In fact, views from across the ideological spectrum are converging on the notion that a semi-permanent monetization of larger fiscal deficits will be unavoidable – and even desirable – in the next downturn.
Left-wing proponents of so-called Modern Monetary Theory argue that larger permanent fiscal deficits are sustainable when monetized during periods of economic slack, because there is no risk of runaway inflation.
Following this logic, in the UK, the Labour Party has proposed a “People’s QE,” whereby the central bank would print money to finance direct fiscal transfers to households – rather than to bankers and investors.
Others, including mainstream economists such as Adair Turner, the former chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, have called for “helicopter drops”: direct cash transfers to consumers through central-bank-financed fiscal deficits.
Still others, such as former Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and his colleagues at BlackRock, have proposed a “standing emergency fiscal facility,” which would allow the central bank to finance large fiscal deficits in the event of a deep recession.
Despite differences in terminology, all of these proposals are variants of the same idea: large fiscal deficits monetized by central banks should be used to stimulate aggregate demand in the event of the next slump.
To understand what this future might look like, we need only look to Japan, where the central bank is effectively financing the country’s large fiscal deficits and monetizing its high debt-to-GDP ratio by maintaining a negative policy rate, conducing large-scale QE, and pursuing a ten-year government bond yield target of 0%.
Will such policies actually be effective in stopping and reversing the next slump?
In the case of the 2008 financial crisis, which was triggered by a negative aggregate demand shock and a credit crunch on illiquid but solvent agents, massive monetary and fiscal stimulus and private-sector bailouts made sense.
But what if the next recession is triggered by a permanent negative supply shock that produces stagflation (slower growth and rising inflation)?
That, after all, is the risk posed by a decoupling of US-China trade, Brexit, or persistent upward pressure on oil prices.
Fiscal and monetary loosening is not an appropriate response to a permanent supply shock.
Policy easing in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s resulted in double-digit inflation and a sharp, risky increase in public debt.
Moreover, if a downturn renders some corporations, banks, or sovereign entities insolvent – not just illiquid – it makes no sense to keep them alive.
In these cases, a bail-in of creditors (debt restructuring and write-offs) is more appropriate than a “zombifying” bailout.
In short, a semi-permanent monetization of fiscal deficits in the event of another downturn may or may not be the appropriate policy response.
It all depends on the nature of the shock.
But, because policymakers will be pressured to do something, “crazy” policy responses will become a foregone conclusion.
The question is whether they will do more harm than good over the long term.

Where Are the Global Leaders?
The G-8 Summit in Japan earlier this month was a painful demonstration of the pitiful state of global cooperation.
The world is in deepening crisis.
Food prices are soaring.
Oil prices are at historic highs.
The leading economies are entering a recession.
Climate change negotiations are going around in circles.
Aid to the poorest countries is stagnant, despite years of promised increases.
And yet in this gathering storm it was hard to find a single real accomplishment by the world’s leaders.
The world needs global solutions for global problems, but the G-8 leaders clearly cannot provide them.
Because virtually all of the political leaders that went to the summit are deeply unpopular at home, few offer any global leadership.
They are weak individually, and even weaker when they get together and display to the world their inability to mobilize real action.
There are four deep problems.
The first is the incoherence of American leadership.
While we are well past the time when the United States alone could solve any global problems, it does not even try to find shared global solutions.
The will to global cooperation was weak even in the Clinton administration, but it has disappeared entirely during the Bush administration.
The second problem is the lack of global financing.
The hunger crisis can be overcome in poor countries if they get help to grow more food.
The global energy and climate crises can be overcome if the world invests together to develop new energy technologies.
Diseases such as malaria can be overcome through globally coordinated investments in disease control.
The oceans, rainforests, and air can be kept safe through pooled investments in environmental protection.
Global solutions are not expensive, but they are not free, either.
Global solutions to poverty, food production, and development of new clean energy technology will require annual investments of roughly $350 billion, or 1% of GNP of the rich world.
This is obviously affordable, and is modest compared to military spending, but is far above the pittance that the G-8 actually brings to the table to solve these urgent challenges.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made a valiant effort to get the rest of Europe to honor the modest aid pledges made at the G-8 Summit in 2005, but it has been a tough fight, and one that hasn’t been won.
The third problem is the disconnection between global scientific expertise and politicians.
Scientists and engineers have developed many powerful ways to address today’s challenges, whether growing food, controlling diseases, or protecting the environment.
And these methods have become even more powerful in recent years with advances in information and communications technology, which make global solutions easier to identify and implement than ever before.
The fourth problem is that the G-8 ignores the very international institutions – notably the United Nations and the World Bank – that offer the best hope to implement global solutions.
These institutions are often deprived of political backing, underfinanced, and then blamed by the G-8 when global problems aren’t solved.
Instead, they should be given clear authority and responsibilities, and then held accountable for their performance.
President Bush may be too unaware to recognize that his historically high 70% disapproval rating among US voters is related to the fact that his government turned its back on the international community – and thereby got trapped in war and economic crisis.
The other G-8 leaders presumably can see that their own unpopularity at home is strongly related to high food and energy prices, and an increasingly unstable global climate and global economy, none of which they can address on their own.
Starting in January 2009 with the new US president, politicians should take the best chance for their own political survival, and of course for their countries’ well-being, by reinvigorating global cooperation.
They should agree to address shared global goals, including the fight against poverty, hunger, and disease (the Millennium Development Goals), as well as climate change and environmental destruction.
To achieve these goals, the G-8 should set clear timetables for action, and transparent agreements on how to fund it.
The smartest move would be to agree that each country tax its CO2 emissions in order to reduce climate change, and then devote a fixed amount of the proceeds to global problem solving.
With the funding assured, the G-8 would suddenly move from empty promises to real policies.
Backed by adequate funding, the world’s political leaders should turn to the expert scientific community and international organizations to help implement a truly global effort.
Rather than regarding the UN and its agencies as competitors or threats to national sovereignty, they should recognize that working with the UN agencies is in fact the only way to solve global problems, and therefore is the key to their own political survival.
These basic steps – agreeing on global goals, mobilizing the financing needed to meet them, and identifying the scientific expertise and organizations needed to implement solutions – is basic management logic.
Some may scoff that this approach is impossible at the global level, because all politics are local.
Yet today, all politicians depend on global solutions for their own political survival.
That by itself could make solutions that now seem out of reach commonplace in the future.
Time is short, since global problems are mounting rapidly.
The world is passing through the greatest economic crisis in decades.
It’s time to say to the G-8 leaders, “Get your act together, or don’t even bother to meet next year.”
It’s too embarrassing to watch grown men and women gather for empty photo opportunities.

Currency Chaos
BRUSSELS – Guido Mantega, Brazil’s finance minister, aptly captured the current monetary Zeitgeist when he spoke of a looming “currency war.”
What had seemed a bilateral dispute between the United States and China over the renminbi’s exchange rate has mutated into a general controversy over capital flows and currencies.
Today, every country seems to want to depreciate its currency.
Japan has resumed foreign-exchange intervention, and the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are preparing another large-scale purchase of government bonds – a measure called “quantitative easing,” which lowers long-term interest rates and indirectly weakens the currency.
China is fiercely resisting US and European pressure to accelerate the snail-paced appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar.
Emerging-market countries are turning to an array of techniques to discourage capital inflows or sterilize their effect on the exchange rate.
Only the eurozone seems to be bucking the trend, as the European Central Bank has allowed a rise in the short-term interest rate.
But even the ECB cannot be indifferent to the risks of appreciation, because a strong euro may seriously complicate economic adjustment in countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland.
A world in which every country wants a weaker exchange rate is not without precedent.
It happened in the 1930’s, when one country after another abandoned the gold standard, trying to export its unemployment.
But everyone cannot have a weak currency at the same time, so, in 1944, responsibility for preventing beggar-thy-neighbor depreciation was assigned to the International Monetary Fund, whose Articles of Agreement mandate it to “exercise firm surveillance over the exchange-rate policies” of member countries.
Given this mission, it would seem that the IMF should help extract concessions from China and the rest of the world should declare a truce.
But this would ignore a fundamental asymmetry between advanced and emerging countries.
Both have suffered from the crisis, but not in the same way.
According to the IMF, real output in advanced countries this year will still be below 2007 levels, whereas it will be 16% higher in emerging and developing countries.
Looking ahead, advanced countries will continue to struggle with the fallout of the 2008 crisis, especially with the deleveraging of indebted households and dire public finances.
The IMF also reckons that the advanced countries must cut spending or increase taxes by nine percentage points of GDP on average over the current decade, in order to bring the public-debt ratio to 60% of GDP by 2030.
Emerging countries, however, do not need any consolidation to keep their debt ratio at 40% of GDP.
Asymmetry of this magnitude requires a significant adjustment of relative prices.
The relative price of the goods produced in the advanced countries (their real exchange rate) needs to depreciate vis-à-vis the emerging countries in order to compensate for the expected shortfall in internal demand.
In fact, this will happen whatever the exchange rate between currencies.
The only difference is that, if exchange rates remain fixed, advanced countries will have to go through a protracted period of low inflation (or even deflation), which will make their debt burden even harder to bear, and emerging countries will have to enter an inflationary period as capital flows in, driving up reserves, increasing the money supply, and ultimately boosting the price level.
For both sides, it is more desirable to let the adjustment take place through changes in nominal exchange rates, which would help contain deflation in the north and inflation in the south.
But, compared to July 2007, at the onset of the crisis, exchange rates between advanced and emerging countries have barely changed.
True, some currencies have risen and others have fallen, but on average almost nothing has happened.
The adjustment that needs to take place is blocked.
For each central bank, the question is not what happens to, say, emerging countries as a whole, but what happens to its own currency vis-à-vis competitors.
So Brazil does not want to appreciate vis-à-vis other Latin American countries, Thailand does not want to appreciate vis-à-vis other Asian countries, and no one wants to appreciate vis-à-vis China, which fears that renminbi appreciation would lead labor-intensive industries to migrate to Vietnam or Bangladesh.
Thus, a change that is in everyone’s interest is hampered by lack of coordination.
Quantitative easing in the advanced countries also raises a question of coordination.
QE is a legitimate monetary-policy instrument, but the Fed and the Bank of England would probably not embrace it with such enthusiasm were it not for the anticipated exchange-rate depreciation.
In fact, the ECB’s perceived reluctance to follow suit is likely to add to the expected growth effects of US or British monetary-policy choices, at the expense of the eurozone.
The controversy over China’s exchange-rate policy thus is no mere bilateral US-China trade dispute, but rather a global macroeconomic clash between advanced and emerging countries.
Moreover, the lack of coordination in both advanced and emerging countries suggests that the solution to currency wars is not to declare a truce, but to recognize the nature of the issue and overcome the problems that stand in the way of agreed common solutions.
This is not to say that the renminbi’s exchange rate is a secondary issue.
On the contrary, its importance stems from the fact that China holds the key to global adjustment.
The recent IMF/World Bank annual meetings indicate that this is gradually being recognized, with emerging countries increasingly critical of China’s inflexibility.
So now is the IMF’s moment.
The Fund should propose a conceptual framework for the discussions to be held on exchange-rate problems by providing an objective assessment of the adjustments that are needed, and by facilitating settlement within the multilateral framework.
The IMF cannot substitute for governments’ choices. But it can help the search for a solution.

State Aggression and Judicial Passivity
WASHINGTON, DC – When the member states of the International Criminal Court gather later this month in Kampala, Uganda, for a conference to review the ICC’s work, one issue on the agenda will be whether to amend the Court’s statute to allow it to exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.
That issue was deferred when the ICC Statute was adopted in 1998.
Based on my experience as an international prosecutor, and speaking as a strong supporter of the ICC, I believe that it would be a serious mistake to add the crime of aggression to the Court’s docket now.
The issue should be deferred again.
By any measure, the ICC has gotten off to a strong start in generating global support and demonstrating its potential to address the problem of official impunity for serious international crimes.
But it also has encountered charges of politicization, and it is still learning, as an institution, how to exercise effectively its jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
The experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which also addressed genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, should sound a cautionary note for ICC members as they debate whether to add the crime of aggression to their jurisdiction.
One of the greatest challenges I faced as the ICTY prosecutor was convincing the Serbian public that the court was not a politically motivated conspiracy against Serbia.
This challenge would have been immensely greater – perhaps impossible – if the Tribunal’s jurisdiction had included the crime of aggression.
Indeed, including aggression would have required me to investigate and potentially prosecute the decision to go to war – inherently a profoundly political decision.
Prosecuting that decision would have inflamed suspicions of an anti-Serbian plot; choosing not to prosecute would have incited countervailing charges that the Tribunal was not fulfilling its mandate.
Such a debate would have diverted attention and energy from the imperative of fairly and effectively providing justice and accountability for the grave crimes then being committed against civilians in the former Yugoslavia.
Now is not the time for the ICC to risk embroiling itself in similar controversy.
The issues that would arise from dealing with allegations of aggression would give ammunition to the ICC’s critics who claim that it is a highly politicized institution.
Moreover, as a young institution, the Court still has much work to do in effectively investigating and prosecuting the crimes over which it already exercises jurisdiction.
Cooperation from member states and the relationship between peace and justice are just two vital issues that require sustained attention at Kampala and beyond.
Grappling with the crime of aggression also threatens to open rifts among members of the Court and other Court supporters.
Despite years of complex negotiations, deep disagreements persist over key issues related to amending the statute on aggression, such as state consent and how cases would be initiated.
It is unrealistic to expect consensus to be reached on these issues in the days remaining before the Kampala meeting.
And attempting to force a decision in the absence of consensus would vitiate one of the strongest assets the Court has had – the solidarity of its members in the face of efforts to undermine the project of an effective and independent international mechanism for justice and accountability.
The ICC review conference in Kampala will not be the last opportunity to amend the statute.
The Court’s members can choose to do so at any time in the future.
They should wait at least until the Court is more established institutionally and a broader consensus emerges on the relevant issues.

Unfreezing Europe's Northern Dimension
COPENHAGEN: Slowly, ever so slowly, Europe is establishing its new political geography.
Enlargement of the European Union to include the first batch of applicant countries is now within reach as more and more chapters are closed in the bilateral negotiations.
The biggest remaining hurdle concerns the political will among today's EU members to set the actual dates for enlargement.
Later this year, in Prague, NATO's leaders may also give the green light to the next group of new members.
So 2001 can be a crucial year in the never-ending story of the creation of a new and better Europe.
This is why relations with Russia must also be placed high on Europe's agenda this year.
If you look at the new map of Europe, it is obvious where the focus must be: Northwest Russia already shares borders with both the EU and NATO (a fact often missed by those who argue against "expanding NATO right up to the borders of Russia").
This proximity offers the prospect of friction or, if Europe seizes the moment, the most promising of possibilities for economic growth.
After all, Russia's reforms, many of Russia's leading reformers, and President Putin himself all began their careers in St. Petersburg.
The "Northern Dimension," a concept developed during Finland's EU-presidency of two years ago, has been picked up by the present Swedish presidency.
On April 9th, foreign ministers from the EU, Russia, and other countries from the Baltic Sea Region will meet in Luxembourg to review implementation of the so-called Northern Dimension Action Plan and provide political guidance for developing this initiative.
An injection of renewed purpose from the EU's political leaders is undoubtedly needed.
Such could provide inspiration for the entire region, including its postcommunist countries, where a huge potential for growth exists.
The driving force, however, can only be an understanding that EU enlargement must be regarded as a win-win situation for all countries involved directly or indirectly - including Russia.
For Russia has legitimate and undeniable interests at stake.
Think of the Kaliningrad-oblast.
With Lithuania's independence it was cut off by land from Russia.
Soon, it may appear even more isolated to Russians, as Poland and Lithuania enforce the EU's Schengen border rules.
To secure regional stability, Russia must be convinced that all countries have the right to choose the international organisations in which they wish to be members.
So Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania cannot be regarded as special Russian "spheres of influence" requiring Russian assent for membership in either the EU or NATO.
Yet, to obtain that kind of understanding, Russia must be able to see its own interests - in particular the economic health of Kaliningrad and Northwest Russia - taken into account as the EU enlarges.
So co-operation between Russia and the EU must be extended on many practical issues.
Unleashing the potential for growth in the Baltic Sea Region is one powerful way to achieve this end.
Governments and think-tanks in the region are already pointing the way ahead.
A recent study presented at the Baltic Development Forum suggested that, if Poland and the three Baltic countries become EU members in 2003 and continue their efforts to catch up economically with the rest of the Union, annual growth in their GDP can be 2-4% higher than the EU-average.
In the coming decade, Poland might double its GDP, the Baltic countries increase their GDP by 60%.
The benefits of such growth for present regional EU members will more than outweigh the direct budget costs linked to enlargement.
So: a win-win situation.
But EU-enlargement alone will not do the trick.
A comprehensive strategy is needed to realise the region's full potential.
Here Professor Michael Porter of Harvard University has proposed a "Baltic Rim Regional Agenda" to develop an innovative and co-operative mindset to improve the region's business development.
In it, private business takes the driver's seat in the economic and political transition.
But private business can only meet that challenge if governments are prepared to remove the many barriers that exist to growth and free trade.
In the past, the Baltic Sea Region was one of Europe's most economically dynamic areas.
Trade and cultural exchanges flourished.
Then came years of Cold War division.
Half of the Baltic Sea became an economic dead sea.
When Europe's division ended, an opportunity to recreate the Baltic's traditional free movements of people, ideas and merchandise - all of which once contributed mightily to regional prosperity - suddenly appeared.
The importance of seizing this opportunity cannot be overstated.
Indeed, Immanuel Kant's old imperative - that trade is peace-making - should not be forgotten.
Special resonance is added to this thought by the fact that Kant himself was born in what used to be K”nigsberg, now Russia's Kaliningrad.
Much talk will be heard in coming months: the ministerial meeting in Luxembourg, numerous conferences and seminars around the region, and in September a Baltic summit will be held in St. Petersburg at which political and business leaders will discuss what is needed in order to move ahead.
All this talk is essential and good. But it is vital to move quickly beyond rhetoric if we are to deal effectively with Europe's "Northern Dimension."
EU enlargement - and the process of involving Russia - must not be slowed by a lack of political will and vision among European leaders.

What NATO’s Northern Expansion Means
STOCKHOLM – While the likely outcome of Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine remains unclear, Russia’s aggression has already changed the European security order in important ways. The only modern European historical comparison is Hitler’s invasion of Poland in September 1939.
Both cases involved large-scale unprovoked attacks on a neighboring country with the aim of eliminating it. Hitler refused to accept the existence of an independent Poland; Putin refuses to accept the reality of an independent Ukraine.
Putin’s invasion came as a profound shock to European governments.
Most European leaders had played down US warnings about an imminent attack, reasoning that although Putin can be unpredictable, he was unlikely to do anything so irrational.
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell had received fairly rough treatment on his first visit to Moscow in early 2021; but most European governments still believed that diplomacy could produce a more stable relationship.
That illusion was shattered on February 24, which has become Europe’s 9/11: a global and geopolitical wake-up call with two main consequences.
First, military spending will increase across Europe.
After years of foot-dragging, almost all European NATO members have suddenly aligned with the goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense.
Europe’s largest economy, Germany, will add the equivalent of 0.5% of GDP to its defense spending in just one year.
Second, NATO will be strengthened in several ways.
In addition to increasing its military presence in member states adjacent to Russia, the alliance is poised to add Finland and Sweden to its ranks.
Both have developed their relations with NATO since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine, but now they will take the critical step of applying for formal membership.
February 24 created an entirely new security situation for Finland and Sweden, because it demonstrated overnight that Russia is in the hands of a regime that will use military force to impose its imperial designs on Europe.
Since Finland fought a war with the Soviet Union in 1939-40 and had been a part of the Russian Empire for a century before 1917, the invasion of Ukraine immediately convinced its leaders to seek NATO membership.
Finland’s own fragile arrangement with the Soviet Union, and later with Russia, was one of the main reasons why Sweden, too, stayed out of NATO.
Following the accession of Norway and Denmark to the alliance in the late 1940s, Sweden pursued a Cold War policy of neutrality supported by strong defense forces.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland and Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and gradually deepened their defense cooperation with NATO, and thus with the United States.
Full NATO membership was regarded as a potential option for some later date. But although Finnish and Swedish public opinion had become slightly more receptive to the idea, majorities were still skeptical or opposed.
But February 24 tipped the balance.
While there are still domestic political processes to work through, it is now virtually certain that both countries will submit applications for membership well before the NATO summit in Madrid in late June.
Public opinion has changed dramatically in recent weeks.
In Sweden, all major political parties, except for the former Communist party and the dwindling Green Party, now favor membership; in Finland, all political parties from the right to the left have signaled their support.
We are witnessing a political sea change, all owing to Putin’s imperial delirium.
Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO will alter the European security architecture in two important ways.
First, northern Europe will acquire the capacity to coordinate substantial defense forces regionwide.
Sweden and Finland will furnish NATO with important new capabilities, as already demonstrated by the regular air force training exercises that they hold with Norway.
Moreover, NATO will have a greater capacity to control the Baltic Sea, and thus to support the defense of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
Second, Swedish and Finnish membership will reinforce the European pillar within NATO.
Both countries are proponents of developing the EU’s defense and security dimension, and of strengthening transatlantic ties, including the important security relationship with the United Kingdom.
While NATO will remain the primary guarantor of territorial defense, the EU – with its broader policy arsenal – will become an increasingly important security alliance, and coordination between the two will deepen.
An important development to watch will be Denmark’s June 1 referendum to lift restrictions on the country’s participation in EU security and defense policies.
These constraints are remnants of controversies from the early 1990s, and Denmark – along with Sweden – has already committed to increasing its defense expenditure to 2% of GDP.
Taken together, these steps will substantially strengthen the entire Nordic-Baltic region’s defense potential.
A stronger defense will remain crucial as long as the Kremlin remains on its current course. But northern Europeans also must take care not to provoke Russia, which has important resources and economic hubs close to Sweden and Finland.
St. Petersburg is Russia’s second-largest city and a major industrial zone; and the Kola Peninsula is the site of Russian submarine bases and other facilities, as well as the world’s single-largest concentration of nuclear weapons.
Russian leaders describe their imperial project as a “life or death struggle.”
Taking that characterization seriously, Finland and Sweden no longer view NATO membership as a strategic choice. Since February 24, it has become an existential imperative.

After the War on Terror
NEW YORK – The basic outlines of Barack Obama’s approach to foreign policy became clear in 2009.
His administration believes that the United States should talk with other governments even if it disagrees profoundly with their character.
He prefers acting with other countries to going it alone.
And he has shifted the focus of US foreign policy from what countries do within their borders to how they act beyond them.
All of this differentiates Obama from his immediate predecessor, George W. Bush, whose administration branded selected countries as evil and mostly refused to deal with them; often rejected cooperation with other governments, lest the US find itself constrained; and sought to transform other countries, rather than to influence their actions.
Any parallels between Obama’s foreign policy and that of Bush are more with the father, America’s 41st president, George H.W. Bush.
Diplomacy, of course, should not be viewed as a favor or concession that signals “softness.”
Obama rightly recognizes that it is an important tool of foreign policy, to be employed when it promises results that are more favorable than the alternatives.
Obama is also correct that acting in concert with others is almost always desirable.
The challenges that most define this era – nuclear proliferation, terrorism, global climate change, and pandemic disease – can be managed only collectively.
Moreover, the reality is that the US is now too stretched economically and militarily to succeed by relying solely on its own resources.
Finally, Obama is right to focus more on the behavior of countries than on their nature.
It is not just that the assistance of odious governments is sometimes essential; it is also that there is nothing more difficult than remaking the internal workings of other societies.
Yet, even with these adjustments, and despite Obama’s communication skills and his personal popularity (reflected in his Nobel Peace Prize and in declining anti-Americanism around the world), 2009 was a difficult first year for his administration’s foreign policy.
To begin with, a willingness to talk to governments does not always translate into an ability to work with them.
The US has shown new flexibility with Iran and North Korea, but neither has reciprocated so far.
Reasonableness does not always yield results.
Similarly, countries often choose not to cooperate.
China, for example, resists using its influence with North Korea, fearing that instability on the Korean peninsula could lead to large refugee flows into China or a united Korea allied with the US.
China prefers an imperfect status quo to such alternatives.
For its part, Russia appears reluctant to pressure Iran to reining in its nuclear ambitions.
Obama has worked hard to improve US-Russian ties: bilateral arms control is again a priority, and the president agreed to alter plans for anti-missile deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic.
But Russian leaders resist tough sanctions on Iran, lest they jeopardize financial dealings there and lead to increased Iranian support for Muslim minorities inside Russia.
As a result, it will be difficult in 2010 and beyond to develop an effective package of sanctions and incentives that enjoys broad international backing.
Similarly, when it came to negotiating a new pact to mitigate global climate change, diplomatic efforts had to contend with international discord in 2009, forcing leaders to postpone their efforts yet again.
With developing countries fearing the impact of binding limits on carbon emissions on their economic growth, and with insufficient support in the US Congress, a global treaty appears unlikely in 2010 as well.
In the Middle East, despite Obama’s vow to re-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, progress remained stymied by differences over the scope and content of an agreement and how to bring it about.
The lack of forward movement stems not just from disagreement over goals, but also from the inability of a divided Palestinian leadership to compromise.
Weak protagonists make poor participants in peace negotiations.
Moreover, other countries’ domestic politics do matter for what Obama can accomplish.
Afghanistan’s often corrupt and incompetent government undermines counter-insurgency efforts there.
Pakistan’s government does not share the same threat assessments or priorities as its American benefactor.
No amount of increased American military effort is likely to offset the resulting lack of progress in weakening extremists in both countries.
Domestic politics in the US is also getting in the way of Obama’s foreign-policy goals.
The absence of consensus on climate change, or resistance in Congress to new trade agreements, weakens the president’s hand.
And America’s unwillingness to take meaningful steps to reduce its ballooning fiscal deficit further undermines the effectiveness of its foreign policy.
Finally, some of what the Obama administration chose to do (singling out Israeli settlements, for example) and how it did it (Guantánamo comes to mind) made tough situations tougher.
But the larger truth is that the world has become a more difficult place to manage, much less to lead.
The post-Cold War era of US unipolarity has ended, owing to America’s economic mismanagement, the war in Iraq, the continuing rise of other countries, and globalization.
There are bright spots, of course.
America’s relations with other major powers – China, India, Japan, Russia, Europe, and Brazil – are at least as cooperative as they are competitive; conflict between such major powers, the dominant characteristic of the international order in the twentieth century, is unlikely.
It is also possible that some of today’s most closed countries, including Iran, North Korea, Burma, Cuba, and Venezuela, will become more open and less threatening with time.
On balance, though, early evidence suggests that this will not be an era of smooth multilateralism or American leadership.
Something more complicated, and unwieldy, appears increasingly likely.
Barack Obama’s next three years in office (or seven, if he is re-elected in 2012) will likely be characterized as much by frustration as by accomplishment.

Making Murder Great Again
ATLANTA – The recent film Joker tells the story of Arthur Fleck, a lonely psychopath and party clown who tries to build a career as a stand-up comedian but is rejected and humiliated.
He then takes revenge on society by becoming a murderer and provoking riots “against the rich.”
Although Joker won the prestigious Golden Lion award for best film at this year’s Venice International Film Festival, it has divided opinion.
Many reviewers praised the movie, arguing (predictably) that its violent protagonist is leading a revolt against a cruel, unjust order.
The Joker, they say, is a downtrodden hero whose violence constitutes a courageous act of self-expression.
Others take a dimmer view of the main character, pointing to his madness, cruelty, and vicious intent.
Unlike the conflicted murderer Raskolnikov in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, the Joker is a vengeful maniac who commits his crimes in cold blood, feeling no responsibility, much less remorse.
Todd Phillips, Joker’s director, is perplexed by the “double standards” applied to his movie.
“I just saw John Wick 3.
He’s a white male, he kills 300 people, and everybody’s laughing and hooting and hollering,” Phillips said.
“Why does this movie get held to different standards?
It honestly does not make sense to me.”
The bigger question is whether a murderous psychopath should be the protagonist in a film critiquing the existing social order.
True, the United States, with a highly uneven distribution of wealth mirroring that in Russia under President Vladimir Putin, rather than most other developed countries, certainly needs social change.
But are the Joker and his ilk, and films that indulge in murderous monsters and unrestrained violence, really the best vehicles for promoting social justice?
Both Phillips and the actor Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the title character, have sought to rebuff such criticism by relying on the mainstream trope of viewing monsters as victims of injustice.
Their crimes, Phillips says, stem from “a lack of love, childhood trauma, lack of compassion in the world.”
Moreover, as David Sims pointed out in The Atlantic, “Joker is hardly the first movie in history to focus on a disturbing antihero.”
Numerous films depicting brain-eating zombies, bloodsucking vampires, or serial killers have been praised as critiques of capitalist exploitation, American imperialism, gender oppression, human speciesism, and so on.
In fact, has any monster not yet been considered as a potential conveyor of revolutionary ideas?
The idea that a murderous monster may symbolize a protester or an outcast, and therefore deserve sympathy, originated with the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Pierre-Félix Guattari.
Challenging René Girard’s explanation of the origins of irrational violence and hatred against the Other – ethnic or religious minorities who were demonized and victimized – Deleuze and Guattari extended the concept of Otherness to the vampire.
That set the stage for a paradigmatic shift in the understanding of homicidal monsters as the Other. Increasingly, such protagonists became a focus of academic attention, cultural criticism, and popular culture itself.
This fixation on “empathy” toward perpetrators of extreme violence is rooted in an ideological shift in attitudes toward humans.
This shift reflects the influence of the radical critique of humanism and the rejection of anthropocentrism, voiced especially by the animal-rights movement and advocates of transhumanism and posthumanism in popular culture since the 1990s (which I discuss in my book The Celebration of Death in Contemporary Culture).
By legitimizing what was otherwise perceived as low entertainment, stories aestheticizing violence by idealized monsters against human characters quickly became a much sought-after commodity.
What are the social and political implications of this normalization of mayhem in popular culture?
Writing in Time magazine, Stephanie Zacharek calledJoker an exercise in “glamorized nihilism” in which the lead character “inspires chaos and anarchy.”
And the film has certainly sparked fresh debate about the relationship between fictional and real-life violence.
Prior to Joker’s release, the families of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at a cinema in Aurora, Colorado, issued a letter expressing their concern about the atrocities depicted in the film.
Because the Aurora shooting happened during a screening of another Warner Bros. film (The Dark Knight Rises), the letter forced the studio, Phillips, and Phoenix to address the families’ objections.
Whereas the Warner Bros. statement unabashedly advised the public not to confuse fiction with reality, Phoenix’s response summed up the changes in popular culture in recent decades: “I don’t think it’s the responsibility of a filmmaker to teach the audience morality or the difference between right [and] wrong.”
Yet, if Joker is a call for social change, then the film is ultimately about knowing right from wrong – in moral terms and from the point of view of social justice.
Time’s Zacharek spotted the seminal contradiction in the image of the Joker.
“Is he a villain or a spokesperson for the downtrodden?” she asked.
“The movie wants it both ways.
Its doublespeak feels dishonest.”
In The Atlantic, Simsagreed, saying that Phillips “positions Joker as an antihero, an evil figure who nonetheless becomes an avatar of vigilante justice within the film.”
Neither critic, however, explained the nature of this dishonesty.
The Joker is a madman whose gratuitously violent acts are understood and performed as entertainment, not as a call for revolution or social change.
Rather than inspiring its audience to protest against social injustice, the movie sells a commodified antihumanism that radically refutes the exceptional value of human life and democratic freedom.
Although Zacharek is certainly right that “movies don’t cause violence,” they may shape our ideas about what is permissible.
After all, how could on-screen violence against humans not influence the perceived value of human life and human dignity?
Furthermore, if culture is inseparable from politics, as Phoenix believes, then the normalization of mayhem in popular culture could fuel widespread indifference to distinguishing between right and wrong in public life.
We certainly should ask to what extent this indifference, advocated as a professional credo in the entertainment industry, has influenced the behavior of the showman currently occupying the White House.

Bringing It Back Home
CAMBRIDGE – An increasing number of American companies are making plans to shift their headquarters to Europe.
These so-called “inversions” would reduce these companies’ total tax bill by allowing them to escape from the United States’ uniquely unfavorable corporate tax rules.
So what should US policymakers do?
President Barack Obama’s administration is seeking to block corporate inversion through administrative measures that may not hold up in US courts.
It would be far better to develop a bipartisan legislative plan aimed at removing the temptation to shift corporate headquarters in the first place.
Such a plan, if attractive to US multinational corporations, could result in a shift in employment and production to the US and higher tax revenue.
Under current law, US corporate profits are taxed at a rate of 35% – the highest rate among OECD countries, where the average is 25%.
That tax is paid on profits earned in the US and on repatriated profits earned by US companies’ foreign subsidiaries.
For example, the subsidiary of a US firm that operates in Ireland pays the Irish corporate tax of 12.5% on the profits earned in that country.
If it repatriates the after-tax profits, it pays a 22.5% tax (the difference between the 35% US rate and the 12.5% tax that it already paid to the Irish government).
But if it reinvests the profits in Ireland – or in any other country – no further tax must be paid.
Not surprisingly, American firms prefer to leave those profits abroad, either in financial instruments or by investing in new or existing subsidiaries.
As a result, American companies now hold abroad roughly $2 trillion in profits that have never been subject to US tax.
All other OECD countries treat the profits of their companies’ foreign subsidiaries very differently, relying on the so-called “territorial” method of taxing foreign earnings.
For example, a French firm that invests in Ireland pays the 12.5% Irish corporate tax but is then free to repatriate the after-tax profits with a tax of less than 5%.
America’s current tax system adversely affects the US economy in several ways.
The extra tax that US firms pay if they repatriate profits raises their cost of capital, thus reducing their ability to compete in international markets.
Foreign firms can also outbid their US counterparts in acquiring new high-tech firms in other countries.
And when a foreign firm acquires a US company, it pays US tax on the profits earned in the US but not on the profits earned by that firm’s other foreign subsidiaries, thus lowering its total tax bill.
A shift to a territorial system of taxation would remove the disadvantages faced by American multinational corporations and encourage them to reinvest their overseas profits at home, increasing US employment and profits.
Because only a small share of overseas profits is now repatriated, the US government would lose very little tax revenue by shifting to a territorial system.
A few years ago, the US Treasury Department estimated that shifting to a territorial system would reduce corporate tax revenue by only $130 billion over ten years.
It would also be desirable to reduce the US corporate tax rate gradually, bringing it closer to the 25% OECD average.
That, too, would encourage more repatriation of overseas earnings.
Given that American companies have large amounts of profits abroad that have never been subject to US tax, the transition could even be carried out in a way that raises net revenue.
In exchange for shifting to a territorial system and reducing the tax rate, the federal government could tax all of these untaxed past earnings at a low rate to be paid over a ten-year period.
Companies would then be free to repatriate their pre-existing earnings without paying any additional tax, while future foreign earnings could, as in other countries, be repatriated by paying a low 5% tax.
A 10% tax on those existing accumulated foreign earnings would raise about $200 billion over the ten years.
A 15% tax would raise $300 billion.
The choice of tax rate would be part of the negotiation over how far to reduce the overall US corporate tax rate.
For example, with a 10% tax, a company with $500 million of accumulated overseas earnings would incur a tax liability of $50 million, to be paid over ten years.
It could repatriate $500 million at any time with no additional tax liability.
Repatriation of any earnings in excess of $500 million would be subject to a 5% tax.
The shift to a territorial system and a lower corporate tax rate would appeal to American multinational corporations even if they had to pay a 10-15% tax on accumulated past earnings.
If Obama is looking for an opportunity to negotiate a bipartisan deal that would strengthen the US economy and increase employment, he should seriously consider such a package of reforms.

Europe’s Migration Paralysis
BERLIN – For many centuries, Europe was a continent plagued by wars, famines, and poverty.
Millions of Europeans were driven to emigrate by economic and social deprivation.
They sailed across the Atlantic to North and South America, and to places as far away as Australia, to escape misery and seek a better life for themselves and their children.
All of them were, in the parlance of the current immigration and refugee debate, “economic migrants.”
During the twentieth century, racial persecution, political oppression, and the ravages of two world wars became the predominant causes of flight.
Today, the European Union is one of the world’s richest economic regions.
For decades, an overwhelming majority of Europeans have lived in peaceful democratic states that uphold their fundamental rights.
Europe’s own misery and migration has become a distant (if not entirely forgotten) memory.
And yet many Europeans feel threatened once again, not by Russia, which is aggressively pushing outward against its neighbors, but by refugees and immigrants – the poorest of the poor.
While hundreds of boat people have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea this summer, voices have emerged in almost every corner of Europe, 26 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, calling for isolation, mass deportations, and the construction of new walls and fences.
Throughout Europe, xenophobia and open racism are running rampant, and nationalist, even far-right parties are gaining ground.
At the same time, this is only the beginning of the crisis, because the conditions inciting people to flee their homelands will only worsen.
And the EU, many of whose members have the world’s largest and best-equipped welfare systems, appears to be overwhelmed by it – politically, morally, and administratively.
This paralysis creates a significant risk for the EU.
No one seriously believes that individual member states – particularly Italy and Greece, the two countries most affected – can overcome the long-term challenges posed by large-scale migration on their own.
But many member states reject a common European effort, a stance that threatens to accelerate the erosion of solidarity within the EU and reinforce the current trend toward disintegration.
There are three distinct causes of the current migration to Europe: the Western Balkans’ continuing economic malaise; the turmoil in the greater Middle East; and Africa’s civil wars and conflicts.
Intensification or expansion of the war in eastern Ukraine would quickly add a fourth cause of flight.
In other words, all of the migration that Europe currently faces is rooted in grave crises in its own neighborhood.
And yet the EU can do little to address any of them.
Clearly, the EU must substantially strengthen its Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the European Neighborhood Policy, in order to address more effectively the causes of migration at the source.
Perhaps the only failure more glaring than the member states’ refusal to back such reforms is their own failure to act, not least because it has created a legitimacy vacuum that xenophobic populists are now filling.
Given its foreign-policy weakness, Europe can have only a minor impact on the wars and conflicts ravaging Africa and the Middle East (though its influence, however small, should be used and developed).
The Western Balkans, however, is a different story.
Croatia is already an EU member; Montenegro and Serbia have begun membership negotiations; Albania and Macedonia are accession candidates; and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are potential candidates.
Here, the EU has considerable influence.
Why the EU has not become more engaged in the Western Balkans – a region where it can make all the difference by supporting economic and administrative modernization and infrastructure projects to link the region to the Union’s industrial centers – remains the secret of the European Commission and the member states.
The absurd result, however, is that citizens from EU candidate countries are subject to asylum procedures, because no possibility for legal immigration to the EU exists for them.
One special case is that of the Roma, a large minority in the Western Balkans whose members often confront vicious discrimination.
This is a pan-European problem.
The Roma suffered disproportionately after the collapse of communism in 1989, as they worked largely in unskilled industrial jobs that were the first to be cut.
Indeed, many of them – current or future European citizens – have fallen back into deep poverty.
Continuing discrimination against them constitutes a Europe-wide scandal, and the EU, its member states, and candidate countries need to address it.
This summer’s refugee crisis highlights another – and much larger – structural problem in Europe: demography.
As European populations age and shrink, the continent urgently needs immigration.
Yet many in Europe strongly oppose immigration, because it also means social change.
In the long run, policymakers will have to explain to their people that they cannot have economic prosperity, a high level of social security, and a population in which pensioners place a growing burden on the economically active.
Europe’s labor force must grow, which is just one reason why Europeans should stop treating migrants as a threat and start viewing them as an opportunity.

Ban the Bomb Tests
WASHINGTON, DC – The Nuclear Security Summit process, which concluded earlier this month in Washington, DC, shows what can be achieved when political leaders come together to concentrate on a global problem.
The six-year initiative, focused on preventing nuclear terrorism, produced important outcomes on eliminating, minimizing, and securing dangerous nuclear and radiological materials.
Unfortunately, however, the nuclear threat is still far from being neutralized.
The dangers posed by terrorist groups are growing, as are the risks from competition and conflict between nuclear-armed states.
Strong leadership and global cooperation must also be deployed to address other urgent nuclear dangers, particularly the threat of further testing and proliferation of weapons.
There are few bright signs on the horizon.
On the contrary, almost every nuclear-armed state is either expanding or upgrading its nuclear arsenal.
There are no active negotiations to regulate, cap, or further reduce nuclear stockpiles.
Russia and the United States have each deployed more than 1,800 strategic warheads on several hundred submarines, bombers, and missiles – far more than is necessary to deter a nuclear attack.
Many of these weapons can be launched within minutes, increasing the risk of miscalculation.
Meanwhile, North Korea could soon be able to arm ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, a development that would pose a significant threat to all of Asia.
Given the grave dangers, it is in every country’s interest to halt further nuclear competition and eliminate the risks associated with the world’s remaining stockpiles of some 15,000 nuclear weapons.
As US President Barack Obama and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev noted in separate statements during the Nuclear Security Summit, a key element of an effective global risk-reduction strategy must be to bring the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force.
If existing nuclear powers cannot conduct tests, they will not be able to try out new, more sophisticated warhead designs.
Similarly, without test explosions, newer nuclear-armed states will have a far more difficult time developing and fielding smaller, more easily deliverable warheads.
The CTBT has near-universal support.
With 183 state signatories and a de facto test ban in place, the treaty is now a key component of the international nuclear nonproliferation system.
It has established a taboo against testing (violated since 1998 only by North Korea) and slowed the global arms race.
And yet, nearly 20 years after its adoption by the United Nations General Assembly, the CTBT is not valid international law – largely because the US has not ratified it.
The US Senate’s rushed and highly partisan 1999 vote against ratification – and its failure to reconsider the treaty since then – has given the seven other states that must ratify the CTBT a reason for delay.
As a result, the door to further nuclear testing remains open.
Last fall, US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and US Secretary of State John Kerry suggested that the Senate revisit the issue.
Unfortunately, President Barack Obama does not have enough time left in office to launch the time-consuming education and outreach campaign needed before bringing the CTBT to the Senate for another vote.
But his administration could intensify the necessary preparatory work – for presenting new information, answering detailed questions, and dispelling old myths and misconceptions – before he leaves office.
Even if the next US president and Senate do reconsider ratification of the CTBT, a vote may not happen for several years.
In the meantime, it is essential that world leaders seek ways to encourage ratification by other CTBT holdout states and to reinforce the de facto global moratorium on testing.
The G-7 foreign ministers’ declaration on April 11 in Hiroshima – “No state should conduct a nuclear test explosion and all states should sign and ratify the CTBT without delay” – is a good start.
No one knows that better than Japan and Kazakhstan, which have suffered from the terrible effects of nuclear detonations.
As their respective foreign ministers, Fumio Kishida and Erlan Idrissov, warned in September, business as usual will not suffice.
Kishida and Idrissov have invited their counterparts to a ministerial-level meeting in Vienna on June 13 to explore options for bringing the CTBT into force.
They will encourage key holdout states to reaffirm their support for the global testing taboo and to pledge that they will consider ratification “at the earliest possible time.”
As we approach the 20th anniversary of the CTBT, members of the UN Security Council and the General Assembly can take further steps to ensure that nuclear testing remains off-limits.
For example, they could pursue the adoption of a new Security Council resolution and a parallel General Assembly measure calling on all states to refrain from testing and urging quick action on ratification.
Such an initiative would reinforce the global norm against testing and stimulate movement by holdout states.
Just as leaders have cooperated at the Nuclear Security Summit to prevent nuclear terrorism, we need renewed cooperation and leadership to end nuclear testing once and for all.

Emerging Europe’s Deleveraging Dilemma
LONDON – Serbia’s Tigar Corporation, a privatized automobile tire and tube maker, was a poster child for corporate makeovers in transition economies.
Then eurozone deleveraging kicked in, and now the child in the poster is in serious trouble.
When Tigar sold its tire division to France’s Michelin, it invested the entire proceeds in new businesses.
Perhaps capital expenditures were overly ambitious, but they triggered rapid export growth, and more than 2,000 jobs were created in the small town of Pirot to manufacture boots for European fishermen and New York City firemen, as well as technical rubber products.
Expansion was, for lack of other options, financed largely through short-term loans.
Many banks in Serbia and other transition countries in Europe rely heavily on funding from their eurozone parent institutions.
But, since the onset of the global financial crisis, eurozone-based banks’ subsidiaries in emerging Europe have been reducing their exposure to the region.
In 2009-2010, the European Bank Coordination Initiative – known informally as the “Vienna Initiative” – helped to avert a systemic crisis in developing Europe by stopping foreign-owned parent banks from staging a catastrophic stampede to the exits.
But, in the second half of 2011, the eurozone-based parent banks that dominate emerging Europe’s banking sector came under renewed pressure to deleverage.
Many are now radically changing their business models to reduce risk.
Over the last year, funding corresponding to 4% of the region’s GDP – and, in some countries, as much as 15% of GDP – has been withdrawn.
Bank subsidiaries will increasingly have to finance local lending with local deposits and other local funding.
Without disputing the need for some deleveraging, a new incarnation of the Vienna Initiative – Vienna 2.0 – seeks to make the process orderly.
After all, excessive and chaotic deleveraging by lenders to emerging Europe – and the ensuing credit crunch – would destabilize this economically and institutionally fragile region.
For Tigar, deleveraging has meant that banks that had pursued its business only a couple of years ago have suddenly cut lending – even though the company never missed a debt payment.
Previous loans came due, while cash-flow needs grew.
Despite its good operating margins, growing markets, and prime international clients, the company experienced a drop in liquidity, requiring serious balance-sheet restructuring.
Tigar will make it; but many promising companies that lack its solid financial footing will not.
Of course, after several years of unfettered credit expansion, some retrenchment was necessary and desirable, and Tigar probably overextended itself.
But several factors – most of them unrelated to the region – are pressuring banks to pursue faster-than-optimal deleveraging.
For starters, the Basel III package of global banking reforms and the European Union’s corresponding Capital Requirements Directive IV rule create disincentives for cross-border financing.
To be sure, they will help to prevent banks from using instruments resembling collateralized debt obligations (which banks use to repackage individual loans for placement on secondary markets) to reduce their exposure.
But the new regulation also seriously penalizes subsidiary financing in new EU member and accession countries.
Indeed, in many countries, bank guarantees can be issued only on the basis of local subsidiary equity, without support from the parent’s balance sheet.
Furthermore, collateral – especially real-estate assets – will continue to be downgraded.
Poor 2012 corporate financial results will further undermine credit ratings.
Fewer and fewer companies will meet basic risk criteria.
While governments might offer attractive liquidity facilities, banks will be unable to on-lend the funds.
And spillover effects from Greece will continue to affect Balkan and other emerging European banking markets.
Indeed, several Western financial groups are considering partial or complete exits from the region – without any clear strategic replacement in sight.
The potential systemic crisis threatens to accelerate deleveraging further, with serious consequences for emerging Europe.
That is why the Vienna Initiative must become an effective “voice” for the host countries in the Europe-wide debate on debt resolution and banking union.
Every effort must be made to prevent the creation of new barriers within Europe’s financial system.
Some progress has been made toward safeguarding emerging Europe’s banking system.
The European Investment Bank, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have agreed on a new Joint Action Plan, including investment totaling €30 billion ($39 billion) over the next two years, as well as policy advice, to support economic recovery and sustained growth in the region.
They must now deliver.
The European Commission and multilateral lenders should help to facilitate ongoing structural change in the banking sector, including bank acquisitions and balance-sheet restructuring for viable export-driven companies.
In exchange, private banks must live up to their collective responsibility to smooth the deleveraging process and limit the systemic impact of their actions.
Under these conditions, deleveraging could put emerging Europe on a more sustainable growth path.

A Crisis of Ethical Leadership
MOSCOW – “The wise man builds bridges; the fool builds walls.”
That was the sentiment splashed all over Chinese editorial pages last week, when the United States imposed 25% tariffs on some $50 billion of Chinese goods.
Unfortunately, that isolationist approach extends beyond US trade policy in ways that are not just foolish, but also unethical – and they are depleting what is left of the West’s moral authority.
When it comes to trade, China of course immediately retaliated with its own tariffs on $50 billion of US imports, just as Canada, the European Union, and Mexico are retaliating for US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Such disputes, if they continue to escalate, will hurt people all over the world – not least US consumers, businesses, and workers.
Worse, in recent months, US President Donald Trump has ordered a zero-tolerance immigration policy that treats all adults crossing the border illegally – a misdemeanor – as if they were violent criminals.
That has meant referring even asylum seekers for prosecution, and, most controversially, taking away their children to be detained separately.
More than 2,300 minors have been placed in shelters.
Succumbing to political pressure, Trump signed an executive order stating that parents and children would be detained together.
But that order itself may be illegal; while a federal court considers the issue, prosecutions will continue, and there is no plan in place for reuniting families that have already been divided.
The Trump administration’s policy of separating families has faced heavy criticism, including from unexpected places.
Laura Bush – the wife of George W. Bush, the president responsible for the inhumane wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – condemned the policy. The images of separated children were, she argued, “eerily reminiscent of the internment camps for US citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history.”
Trump’s own wife Melania said, via a spokesperson, that she “hates to see” children separated from their families.
Even China – which reportedly has as many as 1,500 political prisoners – chimed in.
And no sooner had America made itself vulnerable to lecturing by such countries than Trump withdrew the US from the United Nations Human Rights Council.
But the US is not alone in pursuing policies that betray values that it long espoused.
In Italy, the new right-wing populist government has begun targeting the Roma population, and Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and deputy prime minister, has been turning away ships carrying rescued migrants.
Hungary, for its part, has just adopted the so-called Stop Soros Law, which criminalizes any effort by an individual or NGO to help an illegal immigrant claim asylum.
It is named after George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier and founder of the Open Society Foundations, whom Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán irrationally accuses of encouraging mass immigration to weaken European nations.
All of this highlights a deepening crisis of ethical leadership that could do as much damage as uncontrolled migration or even a trade war.
Beyond the cruel policies that it enables, it risks emboldening governments like those in China and Russia, as it makes them seem reasonable, even reliable.
This is already happening.
The St. Petersburg Economic Forum, which had lost substantial clout after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, was back in business this year, with President Vladimir Putin presiding over discussions involving the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and International Monetary Fund President Christine Lagarde.
To secure these figures’ participation, Putin did not need to admit any mistakes or re-commit to democracy or the rule of law.
On the contrary, since the event, Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker detained during the annexation of Crimea, launched a hunger strike in the name of the 64 Ukrainian political prisoners currently held in Russia.
But while Western governments issue statements critical of Russia – for its detention of Sentsov and of another 150 religious and political prisoners – their commitment to isolating Putin’s Russia for its behavior is clearly waning.
Add to that unethical domestic policies, and Western claims to “moral leadership” ring increasingly hollow.
Now, Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, can feel freer than ever to ignore Western criticism, but even to hold forth on the benefits of building bridges.
Nor is that a mere metaphor: under Putin’s leadership, Russia has built at least a half-dozen bridges, including one connecting Crimea to Russia’s mainland.
Such projects, like those undertaken prior to the World Cup, look good.
A hunger strike does not.
Fortunately for Putin, in a world where nationalism has been undermining the authority of international law and multilateral institutions, morality is more relative than ever.
And, relative to the likes of Trump, Putin does not look so bad at all.
Yet the erosion of democratic ideals can hardly be blamed solely on Trump; after all, America’s human-rights record is far from unblemished.
Under President Bill Clinton, the US was one of only seven countries that voted against the establishment of the International Criminal Court, which every subsequent US president has refused to join.
Then there was Bush’s capricious War on Terror, followed by Barack Obama’s military intervention in Libya, Somalia, and Yemen, in defiance of international law.
Clearly, Trump is far from the first US president to flout global agreements or structures.
Europe is not above reproach, either.
As Putin has pointed out, the West’s response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea reflects something of a double standard, given that the EU, together with the US, supported Kosovo’s declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008.
After World War II, the world – led by the US and Europe – reassessed international norms and institutions, and created the pillars of today’s rules-based global order.
A similar reassessment is needed today, perhaps shaped by two major crises of our times: migration and international terror.
But Trump’s self-serving “America First” approach is no way forward.
Nor can Russia or China be trusted to defend human rights.
At a time when the EU lacks the confidence and coherence to reclaim its values and champion them globally, who will?

Defending a Divided Iraq
OXFORD – The United States and its allies are facing another major policy challenge in Iraq.
Airstrikes against the Islamic State might unseat the group’s fighters in critical areas; but, as things stand, troops will be needed to hold and govern liberated territory.
Securing Iraq therefore requires a formidable force to be in place, which is why US President Barack Obama’s strategy includes rebuilding the Iraqi army.
But doing so will require overcoming three related obstacles: Iraqi leaders’ military inexperience; corruption and cronyism; and ambiguity regarding the extent of external support.
When states collapse, their constituent parts sometimes inherit armed forces that are competent enough to maintain minimal levels of governance.
This is more often the case when a state breaks up as a result of armed conflict, in which case stability depends on whether the best military leaders are allowed to remain in place.
But states often collapse as an unintended consequence of the presence of a supporting external force.
For example, following Vietnam’s partition in the wake of France’s defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Ngo Dinh Diem, Vietnam’s last non-Communist president, was able to turn to the US military for support. However, staggering levels of corruption under Diem and his US-backed successors, and the replacement of the military’s most competent commanders with Diem’s cronies, ultimately led to the rout of the South Vietnamese Army.
A similar situation is evident in Iraq today.
Divided by sectarianism, Iraq’s armed forces have become unable and unwilling to fight.
In the two years following the withdrawal of US troops, then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, like Diem four decades earlier, set about consolidating political power through patronage.
Al-Maliki sought to protect the interests of Iraq’s Shia at the expense of its Sunni citizens, appointing military leaders based on their tribal and sectarian affiliations rather than their merit.
One might expect a leader who faces internal armed opposition to avoid doing anything that might weaken the military.
But al-Maliki seems to have assumed that external forces would simply come to his aid should he run into trouble.
With his lack of a military background, he seems not to have understood that external forces need to work closely with the local army, and that a sophisticated support network must be in place to avoid logistical disruptions resulting from enemy action or corruption.
Viewing the situation from the ground – which is essential if security is to be restored and economic recovery is to be achieved – local militias must be able to defend themselves against rivals or criminal gangs.
This means that the central government’s role should be to provide more advanced security assets such as fixed or rotary air support, intelligence, and logistical and communications support.
Yet the top priority for the leader of a fragmented state is to gain and consolidate a monopoly on the legitimate use of lethal force.
And donor countries tend to support the leader, because doing so allows them to standardize and simplify assistance.
Unfortunately, this approach seldom works.
Instead, security experts should consider how best to manage the potential for violence among and within the various factions vying for local control.
Strikingly, the reconfiguration of the security forces is usually ignored in post-war political settlements (though this has been changing since Iraq’s implosion).
Indeed, though ethnic divisions can undermine military cohesion, a full appreciation of them can lead to a more robust and stable security environment.
Kurds in Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region, for example, certainly feel more secure having their own soldiers, the Peshmerga, and have proven to be a better fighting force as a result.
By contrast, the weak national Iraqi defense forces are believed to be doing the bidding of the Shia majority.
Contested state breakups create tough policy problems, and there are no ideal outcomes.
But if foreign powers wish to engage constructively, they must understand a country’s internal politics and demographics, and address all affected groups’ security concerns equally and fairly.
Failure to do so leaves everyone weak and vulnerable.

Xi Jinping’s Radioactive Friend
LONDON – Vladimir Putin’s ongoing failure in Ukraine has put his strategic alliance with Chinese President Xi Jinping to the test.
With Putin growing ever more desperate, Xi must finally realize the scale of the threat that his “friendship without limits” with the Russian president poses to China’s economic health, to global stability, and to his own geopolitical ambitions.
While Putin may or may not have been bluffing when he threatened to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine last month, Xi must assume the worst if he wants to be viewed as a responsible leader.
After all, Russia’s military doctrine allows for a nuclear strike to defend Russian territory against an existential threat.
Russia’s illegal annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia provides the pretext for such an attack.
Xi, who is expected to secure an unprecedented third consecutive term as China’s leader at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China later this month, must now turn his attention to preventing World War III.
A Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine – the first use of such weapons since the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 – would ignite a catastrophic global crisis, spoiling Xi’s coronation.
When Xi and Putin met at the Beijing Winter Olympics in February to sign the Sino-Russian cooperation agreement, the plan to invade Ukraine must have seemed like a safe bet: the Russians would quickly topple Ukraine’s leadership, which would make the US and NATO appear weak.
A proxy war would also divert US attention from its rivalry with China – or so Xi thought.
Then Ukraine fought back, exposing Russia’s myriad military weaknesses.
Russian forces have now retreated from the Kharkiv region in the northeast, following Ukraine’s impressive counteroffensive, and are suffering heavy losses near Kherson in the south.
Xi almost certainly conveyed his displeasure with Russia’s failures when he met with Putin at the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.
Putin publicly acknowledged China’s “questions and concerns” about the war – a rare admission of tensions between the two countries – while Xi himself did not publicly mention Ukraine at all.
Xi’s silence stood in stark contrast to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who – in a remarkable volte-face – openly rebuked Putin.
Still, it is hard to believe that Xi is not wondering whether he made the right decision when he tied his political fate to so reckless an ally.
Putin’s “partial mobilization” of 300,000 Russian men to join the fight in Ukraine has triggered protests across Russia and caused more than 200,000 young men to flee the country.
The quality of Putin’s new recruits – who include convicts – is unlikely to help the war effort or assuage Xi’s concerns.
With morale among Russian troops already at rock bottom, an infusion of dispirited and ill-trained draftees may hasten the dissolution of Putin’s military and the fall of his regime, akin to how Czar Nicholas II’s poor leadership during World War I fueled the collapse of the Czar’s armies and the Russian Revolution of 1917.
With his direct appeals to Russian soldiers to surrender or die, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to understand the perilous state of the Russian military better than Putin does.
The point of a proxy war is to weaken one’s adversary, but Putin’s incompetence has achieved the exact opposite for Xi.
NATO is now stronger than it has been at any point since the Cold War’s end, with previously neutral countries like Sweden and Finland applying to join and Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, and increasingly India voicing support for America’s Ukraine policy.
Instead of helping China to establish itself as a counterweight to US global hegemony, Russia has been exposed as too weak and corrupt to defeat even a middling country.
With Putin now issuing direct orders to Russian field commanders, China’s military alliance with Russia must seem almost worthless to Xi.
While the chances of Putin using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine appear slim, they cannot be fully discounted.
So, Chinese officials must be trying to assess how the US and NATO would respond if Putin followed through on his threat.
Given US President Joe Biden’s tough-minded – if still ambiguous – statements, it is safe to assume that the international economic and military response would be far more severe than the sanctions already imposed on Russia.
But if Putin does decide to use a tactical nuclear device to “defend” the Ukrainian territory that he has illegally annexed, he may well open a Pandora’s Box of horrors.
For example, his war has brought considerable chaos to Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, and, in addition to other concerns about their operation, it can no longer be assumed that their spent nuclear fuel rods have always been safely secured during the battles for control of the sites.
This opens the terrifying prospect of some mad partisan creating a “dirty” bomb to use in retaliation.
Putin’s annexations may also undermine the “One China” policy regarding Taiwan, which most of the world accepts.
Some Eastern European countries are already voicing doubts about the wisdom of that policy.
If Xi, who has steadfastly defended the principle of territorial integrity, silently accepts Putin’s annexations, some countries may decide that Xi’s hypocrisy has nullified the “One China” policy.
Ever since he became president ten years ago, Xi has signaled his fear that China could suffer the type of political and economic disintegration that led to the implosion of the Soviet Union.
Putin’s current predicament should serve as another cautionary tale.
The prospect of a regime so rotten that it collapses from within must haunt China’s president almost as much as the threat of nuclear war.

The End of Chinese Central Planning
BEIJING – “Isn’t it now time for China to abandon the concept of a growth target?”
That was the question I asked Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei this week at the 15th annual China Development Forum, which brings together top Chinese officials and an international delegation of academics, leaders of multilateral organizations, and business executives.
Having attended the CDF since former Premier Zhu Rongji initiated it in 2000, I can attest to its role as one of China’s most important platforms for debate.
Zhu welcomed the exchange of views at the Forum as a true intellectual test for China’s reformers.
It was in that spirit that I posed my question to Lou, whom I have known since the late 1990’s.
In that period, he has been Deputy Minister of Finance, founding Chairman of China’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, and now Minister of Finance.
I have always found him to be direct, intellectually curious, a first-rate analytical thinker, and a forward-looking advocate of market-based reforms.
He is cut from the same cloth as his mentor, Zhu.
My question was set in the context of the new thrust of Chinese reforms announced at last November’s Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which emphasized the “decisive role” of market forces in shaping the next phase of China’s economic development.
I prefaced my question by underscoring the inherent contradiction between a target and a forecast in framing China’s major economic objectives.
I argued that the former embodied the obsolete straitjacket of central planning, while the latter was far more consistent with market-based outcomes.
A target perpetuates the image of the all-powerful state-directed Chinese growth machine – a government that will essentially stop at nothing to hit a predetermined number.
While it may seem like splitting hairs, continuing to frame the economic goal as a target sends a message of determined and explicit guidance that now seems at odds with the government’s market-oriented intentions.
Wouldn’t dropping the concept send a far more powerful message?
Isn’t it time for China to let go of the last vestiges of its centrally planned past?
Lou’s response: “Good question.”
China, he went on, is in fact moving away from its once single-minded emphasis on growth targeting.
The government now stresses three macroeconomic goals – job creation, price stability, and GDP growth.
And, as evidenced by the annual “work report” that the premier recently submitted to China’s National People’s Congress, the current emphasis is in that order, with GDP growth at the bottom of the list.
This gives China and its policymakers considerable room for maneuver in coping with the current growth slowdown.
Unlike most Western observers, who are fixated on the slightest deviation from the official growth target, Chinese officials are actually far more open-minded.
They care less about GDP growth per se and more about the labor content of the gains in output.
This is particularly relevant in light of the important threshold that has now been reached by the structural transformation of the Chinese economy – the long-awaited shift to a services-led growth dynamic.
Services, which now account for the largest share of the economy, require close to 30% more jobs per unit of output than the manufacturing and construction sectors combined.
In an increasingly services-led, labor-intensive economy, China’s economic managers can afford to be more relaxed about a GDP slowdown.
Last year was a case in point.
At the start of 2013, the government announced that it was targeting ten million new urban jobs.
In fact, the economy added 13.1 million workers – even though GDP expanded by “only” 7.7%.
In other words, if China can hit its employment goal with 7.5% GDP growth, there is no reason for its policymakers to panic and roll out the heavy counter-cyclical artillery.
That, in fact, was pretty much the message conveyed by a broad cross-section of senior officials at this year’s CDF: Slowdown, yes; major policy response, no.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of the People’s Bank of China, was just as emphatic on this point.
The PBOC, he argued, does not pursue a single target. Instead, it frames monetary policy in accordance with what he called a “multi-objective function” comprised of goals for price stability, employment, GDP growth, and the external balance-of-payments – the latter factor added to recognize the PBOC’s authority over currency policy.
The trick, Zhou stressed, is to assign weights to each of the four goals in the multi-objective policy function.
He conceded that the weighting problem has now been seriously complicated by the new need to pay greater attention to financial stability.
All of this paints China with a very different brush than was used during the first 30 years of its growth miracle. Since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms of the early 1980’s, less and less attention has been paid to the numerical targets of central planning.
The State Planning Commission evolved into the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) – though it is still housed in the same building on Yuetan Street in Beijing.
And, over time, economic managers succeeded in drastically curtailing sector-by-sector Soviet-style planning. But there was still a plan and an aggregate growth target – and an all-powerful NDRC hanging on to the levers of control.
Those days are now over.
A new “leading committee” on reforms is marginalizing the NDRC, and China’s most senior fiscal and monetary policymakers – Lou Jiwei and Zhou Xiaochuan – are close to taking the final step in the long journey to a market-based economy.
Their shared interpretation of flexible growth targeting puts them basically in the same camp as policymakers in most of the developed world.
The plan is now a goal-setting exercise.
From now on, fluctuations in the Chinese economy, and the policy responses that those fluctuations imply, need to be considered in that vein.

America’s G-Zero Moment
NEW YORK – The 2008 financial crisis marked the end of the global order as we knew it.
In advance of the upcoming G-8 summit, it is impossible to overlook the fact that, for the first time in seven decades, the United States cannot drive the international agenda or provide global leadership on all of today’s most pressing problems.
Indeed, the US has trimmed its presence abroad by refusing to contribute to a eurozone bailout, intervene in Syria, or use force to contain Iran’s nuclear breakout (despite strong Israeli support).
President Barack Obama officially ended the war in Iraq, and is withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan at a pace constrained only by the need to save face.
America is handing off the leadership baton – even if no other country or group of countries is willing or able to grasp it.
In short, US foreign policy may be as active as ever, but it is downsizing and becoming more exacting about its priorities.
As a result, many global challenges – climate change, trade, resource scarcity, international security, cyber-warfare, and nuclear proliferation, to name a few – are bound to loom larger.
Welcome to the G-Zero world, a more turbulent, uncertain environment in which coordination on global policy issues falls by the wayside.
Paradoxically, this new environment, though daunting, is less troublesome for the US; in fact, it provides fresh opportunities for the US to capitalize on its unique position. The G-Zero world is not all bad for the US – if it plays its cards right.
Many residual strengths take on greater importance in such a world, and America remains the world’s only true superpower and its largest economy – still more than twice the size of China’s.
Its defense expenditures represent nearly half the world total, and exceed those of the next 17 countries combined.
The dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, and investors’ scramble into US government debt at every peak in the crisis since 2008 has underscored America’s safe-haven status (even in crises that America caused).
Likewise, the US continues to lead in entrepreneurship, research and development, higher education, and technological innovation.
Moreover, it is now the world’s largest natural-gas producer and calorie exporter, which has reduced its vulnerability to price shocks or food shortages.
No country rivals America’s promotion of the rule of law, liberal democracy, transparency, and free enterprise.
While other countries certainly support these values, only the US has been willing, healthy, and big enough to ensure that they prevail.
So, as America curtails its global leadership, it will find itself in more demand.
Consider Asia, for example.
As China’s economic importance and regional influence grows, its neighbors are seeking to deepen ties with the US. Japan, Australia, Indonesia, and Taiwan have all recently closed trade and security-related deals with the US.
Even Burma has gotten on board, resuming diplomatic engagement with the US while trying to work its way out of China’s shadow.
In other words, in a G-Zero world, an increasingly aggressive global environment makes the US all the more appealing to countries seeking to hedge their bets.
As a result, the US has an opportunity to act more precisely in its own interests.
Supplying less leadership allows the US to weigh opportunity costs before taking action, and to select the issues and circumstances that suit it the best.
In this environment, military intervention in Libya does not necessitate the same in Syria.
The extent to which the US will capitalize on these opportunities remains to be seen.
In fact, America’s short-term advantages pose the biggest obstacle to its long-term outlook.
Call this the “safe-haven curse”: as long as the US remains the safest port in any storm, it faces no immediate pressure to address its weaknesses.
For example, for all of the hand-wringing about America’s national debt, investors will continue to loan the US money.
Over the long term, however, US policymakers must make steady progress in restoring confidence in the nation’s fiscal health by cutting politically sacred programs like social security, Medicare, and defense.
Officials will have to put aside short-term motives and party orthodoxy to bolster America’s aging infrastructure, reform its education and immigration systems, and pursue long-term fiscal consolidation.
America’s advantages in the G-Zero world afford it the chance to invest in the future.
But, by cushioning against sufficiently calamitous risks, the same advantages allow the US to procrastinate.
American politicians need to recognize the new G-Zero reality and rebuild America’s domestic sources of strength, even if only incrementally.
If they do, the US will have the vigor and flexibility to shape the next world order.
America’s political system usually works well in crises.
But, thanks to its residual advantages in a leaderless world, the US need not rely on a crisis to precipitate action.
It need only seize the G-Zero moment.

A Pandemic of Hunger
URBANA, ILLINOIS – Around the world, food insecurity is spiking.
Experts predict that the number of hungry people will double during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout Africa, governments struggle to provide for the neediest.
In Burkina Faso, which at one point had the highest number of deaths from COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 2.1 million people don’t have enough to eat.
In Nairobi, people are fighting over their next meal.
In Cape Town, police recently clashed with residents who didn’t receive parcels of rice, beans, oil, and other supplies.
But it is not just Africa.
The tragedy is unfolding on screens across the globe.
In Phoenix, cars begin lining up two hours before boxes with non-perishables were distributed.
In Ohio, more than 4,000 people recently waited for hours to pick up packages of cereal, oatmeal, and pasta.
It is urgent that leaders find ways to ensure sufficient food supplies during the COVID-19 crisis.
Because of lockdowns, sickness, and lost incomes, hunger will rise.
And, because developed and developing countries are equally affected, we must find solutions together.
Data analytics is a key way to track food insecurity.
What is needed is a real-time mapping tool like the data dashboard developed at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering to track confirmed coronavirus cases.
And governments, NGOs, and others on the front lines of the fight against hunger should support the effort.
After all, timely information is vital to diagnosing and eliminating the problem.
Real-time data inform local and national leaders, food banks, and NGOs how to prepare for and respond to emerging needs.
For example, farmers who have excess perishables can report them on the map, and pick-ups and shipments can then be arranged to redistribute the food to communities and households in need.
Likewise, targeted policies are essential.
Leaders must establish initiatives to ensure that people know where they can get their next meal.
In the United States, the $2 trillion stimulus adopted in March will help, to the extent that it supports household incomes.
And in April, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $170 million initiative to curb hunger.
Other US states are launching similar efforts.
In Africa, policymakers must make food security a top priority while stay-at-home orders are in effect.
Citizens should not have to fight each other for their next meal.
Governments need to pass stimulus packages that help all citizens, or seek aid that provides the necessary funds.
While pay cuts like those taken by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, cabinet ministers, and business leaders are symbolically important, governments must provide cash or sustenance for their citizens.
Many lived from hand to mouth before the crisis and now face a choice between starvation and sickness.
Asking people to stay at home without providing resources is both immoral and unlikely to work.
Finding creative ways to distribute aid during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial.
For example, Vietnam now has rice-dispensing ATMs.
More innovations like that are needed.
Most important, however, world leaders must remove trade barriers, so that supply continues to flow across borders – a point that the CEOs of Unilever, Nestlé, PepsiCo, and other multinationals recently emphasized.
The reality is that the pandemic affects all of us, and we must all do our part to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable.
Some among the wealthiest have begun to combat the problem.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Laurene Powell Jobs organized a GoFundMe page via America’s Food Fund.
So far, it has raised more than $26 million.
Several celebrities, including Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, and Oprah Winfrey, have donated to charities such as No Kid Hungry and Feeding America.
Business executives are contributing, too.
Apollo Global Management CEO Leon Black and his wife, Debra, have given $20 million to a program that is providing supplies to health workers.
Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper has donated $22 million to relief efforts.
Celebrities in Africa are pitching in, too.
But let’s not fool ourselves: charity will never be enough.
Stepping up efforts to ensure food security for all is essential to preventing the COVID-19 crisis from becoming a humanitarian calamity, and that objective is above all an imperative for policymakers.

The Pandemic Within the Pandemic
NAIROBI – Fear of COVID-19 is driving increased over-the-counter (OTC) sales and in-hospital prescriptions of antibiotics – and fueling a silent pandemic in its wake.
Globally, antibiotic use in hospitals has surged since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even though studies show that only 8% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 also have an infection requiring antibiotics, more than 70% receive them.
In addition, many people worried about possible or actual COVID-19 symptoms, and alarmed by global reports about the pandemic, have turned to buying antibiotics without seeing a health-care worker.
This is further fueling the global crisis of antibiotic resistance, as bacteria evolve and become immune to these drugs.
We must move quickly – with international policy, national laws, and local action – to control what the World Health Organization has identified as one of the ten leading health threats to humanity.
Antibiotics treat infections caused by bacteria, and have no impact on a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.
Overusing them merely accelerates the emergence of antibiotic resistance, which will undercut our ability to treat common diseases.
Simple infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, which currently can be quickly cleared by common antibiotics, may prove impossible to treat and become deadly.
This is particularly true in many African, South American, and Asian countries, where access to health-care workers is limited and there are no restrictions on antibiotic sales.
In India, antibiotic sales have risen astronomically in recent years, largely driven by unregulated OTC purchases, including of unapproved drugs.
Likewise, in Kenya, all antibiotics can be purchased without a prescription.
Bacteria that develop resistance to multiple antibiotics are responsible for causing difficult-to-treat infections, which are up to three times more likely to kill people than infections caused by non-resistant bacteria.
And data from several countries – including China and Egypt – indicate that up to 50% of bacteria-causing infections in critical-care units are resistant to several antibiotics.
In the United States, it is estimated that close to three million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection each year, leading to more than 35,000 deaths annually.
Drug-resistant bacteria are also more likely to spread from person to person, and have been known to cause large disease outbreaks in hospitals.
Many COVID-19 treatment wards around the world are currently grappling with this problem.
As an infectious-disease specialist working on the COVID-19 management front line and also leading the treatment of drug-resistant infections in Kenya, I have often struggled to treat patients with severe bacterial infections that had developed resistance to all available antibiotics.
Many of the recently developed drugs that could potentially treat resistant bacteria are often extremely expensive and not available in many countries.
A ten-day course of one such antibiotic in Kenya, for example, costs almost $10,000, putting it beyond the reach of most patients.
In fact, many patients entering the hospital for COVID-19 treatment say that they have already taken one or more antibiotics at home in an attempt to address some of their symptoms.
Often, using these drugs had made them feel that they were being treated, so they delayed going to the hospital.
Some may argue that allowing unrestricted use of antibiotics can enable access to treatment for those unlikely to be able to see a doctor, and may be cheaper for the poor.
But the resulting antibiotic resistance is expensive to treat and potentially costs lives.
What must we do to forestall this next pandemic?
For starters, the WHO and other global agencies must speak out much more strongly and explicitly against the use of antibiotics in cases of COVID-19, unless these drugs are specifically indicated for another bacterial infection.
In addition, national governments must tighten restrictions on OTC antibiotic purchases.
Evidence suggests that introducing and enforcing laws to limit such sales can be effective if these efforts are sustained over time.
Requiring pharmacies to display a notice stating that it is illegal to sell antibiotics to customers without a doctor’s prescription also has been associated with reduced antibiotic sales.
Hospitals should adopt so-called antibiotic stewardship strategies to reduce unnecessary prescriptions.
These measures can lead to reduced antibiotic use and cost, and decrease the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitals.
Effective strategies could include developing guidelines for managing common infections, restricting antibiotic use in viral infections, strengthening laboratory capacity – especially in low- and middle-income countries – to help clinicians identify the correct bacteria to treat, and providing continuing education for all clinicians.
Finally, individuals – despite their understandable fears of COVID-19 – should not risk harming themselves by using antibiotics unnecessarily.
The message is clear: if we do not act now to curb antibiotic use, we will invite a new pandemic.
And, unlike COVID-19, no vaccine will save us.

Squashing the Superbugs
LONDON – Current antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective, not only at fighting common illnesses like pneumonia and urinary tract infections, but also at treating a range of infections, such as tuberculosis and malaria, which now risk again becoming incurable.
With the G-7 leaders having committed, in a recent joint declaration, to tackle “antimicrobial resistance” (AMR), it is time for the more inclusive G-20 – and China, as it chairs the group for the first time – to take the fight to the next level.
Failure to address AMR will affect everyone, regardless of their nationality or their country’s level of development.
Indeed, by 2050, ten million people could be dying as a result of AMR, up from around 700,000 today, with China and India each housing about one million sufferers.
At that point, an estimated $100 trillion in global GDP will already have been lost.
No G-7 strategy, however well crafted, can succeed without the involvement of the rest of the international community.
After all, if infections travel with the people who carry them, so does resistance, meaning that the only solution to AMR is a shared one.
That is why members of the World Health Organization have agreed to implement a “global action plan on AMR,” and have called upon the United Nations to convene a high-level meeting of political leaders in 2016.
In this effort, the emerging economies – with their large populations, rising wealth, and growing international clout – have a particularly important role to play, with China leading the way.
We at the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (which I chair) have already recommended such a role for China, including in discussions with some Chinese policymakers.
Between now and 2016, the stage must be set for China to act.
The G-7 countries should drive this effort forward by taking concrete steps to fulfill the commitments they made in their joint declaration.
One such commitment is to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry.
Some European governments have already made significant progress in regulating this practice.
The United States has been slower to act, but has lately made some important policy moves.
But perhaps the best way to change the way livestock are raised is by putting pressure on major food companies – a feat that consumers could achieve most effectively.
Indeed, rising demand for healthier foods, including antibiotic-free meat, has already compelled major food-industry players like McDonald’s, Costco, and KFC to declare their intention to phase out antibiotic-laden meat.
Governments should capitalize on this trend by implementing a major social-media campaign highlighting the smarter, healthier habits that all people should adopt – habits that would indirectly reduce demand for antimicrobials.
The low cost and potentially high payoff of such a campaign makes it all the more appealing.
A second commitment included in the joint declaration – to help ensure that medicines are used only when they are needed – may seem obvious, but in fact represents a major problem driving AMR.
The key to addressing this problem is, as the declaration recognizes, to develop and improve access to rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools.
Improved diagnostic technologies are undoubtedly within the reach of the world’s top technology firms.
But they will invest only if they are confident that health systems will use their innovations.
If governments, say, mandated that particular diagnostic tests must be conducted before antibiotics could be prescribed, companies would have the necessary incentive.
Such a requirement would face criticism, with some claiming that testing takes too long, and thus is not always possible before starting treatment.
While this may be true in rare cases, there are many areas where fast and effective tests exist, but are not yet used widely – either in developing or developed countries.
Consider one of the most common infections: sore throats.
Though they are often viral, rather than bacterial, they are frequently treated with antibiotics – an approach that not only is ineffective, but also fuels AMR.
A quick and easy swab test could solve this problem – and, indeed, one already exists.
In a trial by a British pharmacy chain (which, admittedly, used a small sample), the test reduced the number of antibiotics consumed by nearly 60%.
Investment in the development and deployment of this technology could lead to a substantial decline in unnecessary antibiotic treatments for sore throats, not to mention ease pressure on health systems and save doctors’ time.
A third imperative, recommended by the Review and recognized by the G-7, is improved surveillance of the spread of drug-resistant infections, particularly in developing countries, where such data is most sparse.
On this front, our own government is leading the way, with Chancellor George Osborne pledging in March to allocate £195 million ($307 million) to help emerging countries finance the fight against AMR.
Foundations are likely to pledge their own funds to this initiative.
Meanwhile, the US government is focusing on supporting the development of new drugs via the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
The world faces many challenges and crises, virtually all of which will demand strong political commitment and significant investment to resolve.
But the fact is that, when it comes to AMR, governments have a rare opportunity to preempt a major crisis, at a fraction of the cost of responding to the crisis once it has escalated.
In the scramble to address the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, the US alone had to contribute $5.4 billion in public funds.
Add to that the savings to health systems and even employers, and concerted action to combat AMR becomes even more cost-effective.
That is why the G-7 governments should intensify their efforts to address AMR.
And it is why China and the other emerging economies should join the fight.
Together, we can safeguard the curative powers of our medicines.

Anti-Semitism on Trial
When Brazil's Supreme Court ruled in the case of Sigfried Ellwanger ­- an editor, author, and notorious Nazi sympathizer - it entered the perilous field where free speech and efforts to contain racism meet.
For years, Ellwanger published anti-Semitic books, such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, as well as books of Holocaust denial, such as his own Jewish or German Holocaust: Behind the Lie of the Century.
By a vote of eight to three, the Court upheld his conviction on charges of racism.
Of course, the enormity of the Holocaust ought to have eradicated anti-Semitism for all time.
Shamefully, it did not.
In many places, hatred of Jews thrives.
Elsewhere - including Europe and the United States - anti-Semitism survives among a fringe of neo-Nazis and renegades like Ellwanger, but also, more widely, in milder forms of prejudice.
But punishing someone criminally for being an anti-Semite and a racist propagandist raises troublesome issues that different countries approach in different ways.
To be sure, every country places some limits on speech.
As Oliver Wendell Holmes famously put it in a 1919 US Supreme Court decision, "Even the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater and causing a panic."
Banning someone from shouting "Fire!" in a crowded theater is not the same, however, as convicting him for holding and propagating an opinion, even a despicable one, such as anti-Semitism.
In a democracy, standard restrictions regulate the time, place, and manner of speech in order to prevent imminent violence and civil disorder.
They bar threats against, and harassment of, individuals. They forbid libel and fraud.
Some countries, such as the US, refuse to go further and regulate speech because of its content.
The reason, as US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis put it, is that "If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence."
Why, then, do many countries prosecute the hate speech of racists?
Why do International Human Rights Conventions stipulate that the law should prohibit speech that supports national, racial, or religious hatred?
Is any form of race-related speech that anybody finds offensive to be prosecuted?
Will such prosecutions actually deter hard-core racists?
No court should convict someone lightly because of the views he espouses in the public sphere.
But Ellwanger's appeal, which took almost a year for Brazil's Supreme Court to hear and decide, put Brazil squarely on the side of those who believe that inciting hatred against even a small minority - such as Jews in Brazil - cannot be allowed in the name of freedom of speech.
The Ellwanger case arose because many believe that anti-racism laws can be effective in reassuring minorities of their safety and place in the community.
Brazil is a large, pluralist, multi-ethnic country.
Its social fabric, like that of many other countries around the world, depends on mutual trust among citizens.
Constitutional and legal provisions that make practicing racism a crime punishable by imprisonment have great symbolic significance and help insure - indeed, create and secure - social peace.
Defining the offensive racist views proscribed by the Constitution was the first challenge in the Ellwanger case, because the defense denied that anti-Semitism constitutes racism at all.
The Jews, the defense claimed, do not constitute a race.
In fact, the Jews are, of course, not a race, but then neither are whites, blacks, mulattos, Indians, gypsies, Arabs, or any other subgroup of human beings.
The recently completed sequencing of the human genome proved the existence of but a single race: the human race.
The Court made short shrift of Ellwanger's claim, because all human beings can be the victims of racism.
The practices of racism are historical, political, and cultural phenomena.
Their systematic dissemination endangers minorities, threatening them with invidious discrimination.
The truth of a racist belief is not the issue.
The second issue the Court considered was the conflict between constitutional principles: the clash between freedom to express one's thoughts and condemnation of Ellwanger for the crime of racism.
The court ruled that, ultimately, freedom to express one's thoughts, however generously conceived in a democracy, must be balanced against other values, such as reputation, honor, privacy, dignity, and equality.
Ellwanger crossed the line separating free expression from hate speech.
As in the Ellwanger case, restrictions on free expression should be defined narrowly.
But by opting for a balanced concept of free speech, Brazil's Supreme Court followed precedents in a number of European countries condemning Holocaust deniers, as well the opinion of the committee charged with monitoring compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and the European Court of Human Rights.
In a world where anti-Semitism and racism fester, where prejudice on national, religious, colored-based, or ethnic grounds foster discrimination, that is the view that best nurtures the rights of all.

Rift and Mastery
PARIS – Like brothers in arms united in combat but divided in peace, Europe and the United States, which had fought depression jointly in 2009, started voicing disagreements in 2010 and begin 2011 with divergent positions on macroeconomic policy.
The price of divergence could be steep: though the worst is over, effective coordination of policy is still needed at a time when rebalancing the global economy, as the G-20 has called for, is far from being accomplished.
The transatlantic divide is evident with respect to monetary policy.
In November of last year, the US Federal Reserve’s decision to launch a new cycle of “quantitative easing” (buying up government bonds through monetary creation) triggered fierce criticism in Europe.
While the European Central Bank has also been buying government bonds since last spring, the amount is relatively small (€70 billion, compared to the Fed’s $600 billion program), and is meant only to support troubled eurozone members, with particular care taken to avoid any impact on money supply.
A similar divergence, though less acute, has appeared with respect to fiscal policy.
In December, as Europeans shifted towards fiscal rigor, the US Congress extended for two years the tax cuts initiated by George W. Bush – which almost everyone interpreted as yet another effort to boost the US economy.
True, fiscal retrenchment in Germany is more cautious than official rhetoric suggests.
But, overall, the eurozone and Great Britain have clearly shifted towards austerity, which the US is still very reluctant to consider.
In Europe, this divergence is often attributed to what French President Charles de Gaulle used to refer to as America’s “exorbitant privilege”: the power to print the principal international reserve currency.
But this explanation is only partly satisfying.
Yes, China does pile up reserves in dollars.
But no one forces it to do so, and the US would much prefer a stronger renminbi.
Emerging-market countries could also invest in euros, if only they were offered such liquid assets as US Treasury bonds – therein lies the current debate over the proposed creation of “eurobonds.”
And, while countries like Greece and Spain suffer from market constraints, such is not the case for Northern Europe.
A second interpretation of the transatlantic divide is that the two sides’ policies reflect the differences in their situations.
This is clearly the case with labor markets and unemployment: American companies have reacted to recession with massive layoffs, whereas European companies – with the exception of Spanish firms, but not of British companies – have been doing their best to hoard labor.
As a result, productivity has stagnated in Europe since 2007, whereas it has improved by more than six percentage points in the US.
Of course, another consequence is that the US unemployment rate is close to post-war peaks and will remain high much longer.
And unemployed workers in the US lose their benefits after 99 weeks, making the political imperative for macroeconomic action much stronger than in Europe, where unemployment rose more slowly and benefits are more generous.
As the economist Joseph Stiglitz puts it, America’s welfare state is, first and foremost, the Fed’s monetary policy.
But there is also a third, subtler reading of the EU-US split, which has to do with beliefs.
In the view of most Europeans, none of the ground that has been lost – or only very little of it – can be recovered.
So, because supply has shrunk, it would be dangerous for the central bank or the budget to over-stimulate demand.
And, because tax revenues, too, will not recover, the gap will have to be bridged by fiscal austerity.
Americans, on the other hand, are convinced that whatever was lost during the recent recession will eventually be regained.
The Obama administration says so, as does the Fed (albeit more prudently), and both act accordingly.
In other words, Europeans are pessimistic about the future and thus are reluctant to stimulate growth, whereas Americans remain optimistic and prepared to give any policy instrument a chance.
Thus, divergence over macroeconomic policy will continue – at least as long as investors remain willing to buy US public debt.
Several consequences follow from this divergence: difficulties in policy coordination, given no agreement on the diagnosis; a very probable return to large US external deficits while Europe remains in balance; and a weaker dollar, which will become evident if the crisis in the eurozone subsides.
All this could greatly complicate managing the G-20, and risks obscuring the question that all should be addressing: how to manage a global economy in which the balance between advanced and emerging countries is shifting at great speed.

Economic Rebalancing Acts
LONDON – We all know how the global economic crisis began.
The banks over-lent to the housing market.
The subsequent burst of the housing bubble in the United States caused banks to fail, because banking had gone global and the big banks held one another’s bad loans.
Banking failure caused a credit crunch.
Lending dried up and economies started shrinking.
So governments bailed out banks and economies, producing a sovereign debt crisis.
With everyone busy deleveraging, economies failed to recover.
Much of the world, especially Europe, but also the slightly less sickly US, remains stuck in a semi-slump.
So how do we escape from this hole?
The familiar debate is between austerity and stimulus.
“Austerians” believe that only balancing government budgets and shrinking national debts will restore investor confidence.
The Keynesians believe that without a large fiscal stimulus – a deliberate temporary increase of the deficit – the European and US economies will remain stuck in recession for years to come.
I am one of those who believe that recovery from the crisis requires fiscal stimulus.
I don’t think monetary policy, even unorthodox monetary policy, can do the job.
Confidence is too low for commercial banks to create credit on the scale needed to return to full employment and the pre-crisis growth trend, however many hundreds of billions of whatever cash central banks pour into them.
We are learning all over again that the central bank cannot create whatever level of credit it wants!
So, like Paul Krugman, Martin Wolf, and others, I would expand fiscal deficits, not try to shrink them.
I advocate this for the old-fashioned Keynesian reason that we are suffering from a deficiency of aggregate demand, that the multiplier is positive, and that the most effective way to reduce the private and public debts a year or two down the line is by taking steps to boost growth in national income now.
But the argument between austerians and Keynesians over how to encourage sustained recovery intersects with another debate.
Simply put, what kind of post-recovery economy do we want?
This is where economics becomes political economy.
Those who believe that all was fine with the pre-crisis economy except for banks making crazy loans are convinced that preventing such crises in the future requires only banking reform.
The new reform orthodoxy is “macro-prudential regulation” of commercial banks by the central bank.
Some would go further and either nationalize the banks or break them up.
But their horizon of reform is similarly confined to the banking sector, and they rarely ask what caused the banks to behave so badly.
In fact, it is possible to regard excessive bank lending as a symptom of deeper economic flaws.
The economist Thomas Palley sees it as a means of offsetting growth in income inequality, with access to cheap credit replacing the broken welfare guarantee of social democracy.
So reform requires redistribution of wealth and incomes.
Redistributive measures go quite well with stimulus policies, because they may be expected to increase aggregate demand in the short term (owing to lower-income households’ higher propensity to consume) and minimize the economy’s dependence on debt financing in the long term.
Initial damage to the confidence of the business class caused by higher taxes on the wealthy would be balanced by the prospect of higher overall consumption.
Others argue that we should try to rebalance the economy not just from rich to poor, but also from energy-wasting to energy-saving.
The premise of the green economic agenda is that we have reached the ecological limits of our current growth model, and that we will need to find ways of living that reduce demands on non-renewable sources of energy.
So stimulus policies should aim to stimulate not just demand per se; they must focus, instead, on stimulating ecologically-friendly demand.
For example, greens advocate free municipal transport in major cities.
In general, they argue, we need more care, not more cars, so stimulus money should go to health, education, and the protection of the environment.
The truth is that any fiscally-driven recovery policy is bound to have reformist implications.
That is why the austerians are so against it, and why even those who accept the theoretical case for a stimulus insist on implementing it through monetary policy alone.
Re-balancing the economy from gas-guzzling to energy-saving – and from private to public consumption – is bound to alter the goal of economic policy.
Maximizing GDP growth will no longer be the top priority; rather, it should be something we might want to call “happiness,” or “well-being,” or the “good life.”
The radical case is that the pre-crisis economy crashed not because of preventable mistakes in banking, but because money had become the sole arbiter of value.
So we should be energetic in seeking recovery, but not in a way that simply reproduces the structural flaws of the past.
As Dani Rodrik has well put it: “If economics were only about profit maximization, it would be just another name for business administration.
It is a social discipline, and society has other means of cost accounting beside market prices.”

Genetics' Information Revolution
Unlocking the secrets of the human genome would be impossible without the computerized manipulation of massive amounts of data, including the majority of the three billion chemical units that comprise our own species' genetic blueprint. But what this "bioinformatics" revolution has provided, above all, is stark confirmation of the evolutionary basis of all life on Earth.
Sequence data, whether from proteins or nucleic acids, are well suited to computer processing because they are easily digitized and broken down into their constituent units.
Simple computer programs can compare two or more strings of these units and evaluate degrees of similarity, search huge databases to match new sequences against known ones, and cluster groups of sequences in the form of a family tree.
The implications of research on the first proteins to be studied almost half a century ago were profound.
These sequences were all rather small--insulin has only about 50 amino acids, depending on the species--but the variation between species was clear.
My own interest began with one of these simple molecules 40 years ago, when I was a postdoctoral student in Sweden.
Fibrinopeptides are short sequences that are relatively easy to purify and have the virtue of changing significantly from species to species.
As a result, we were able to show a strong correspondence between the fossil record and most of the changes that were observed in the fibrinopeptide sequences.
So it was obviously possible to interpret the evolutionary past in terms of existing genetic sequences.
But advances in computing were indispensable to further progress.
In 1965, Robert Ledley began the first real sequence database, the Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure.
In 1967, researchers produced a genetic tree of a score of animals and fungi that had virtually the same branching order as would have been drawn by a classical biologist, even though their computer was utterly ignorant of the comparative anatomy, paleontology, embryology, and other non-molecular attributes of these creatures.
Finally, in 1970 a splendid computer innovation enabled the proper alignment of amino acid sequences (which is vital to all subsequent data management).
The interpretation of sequencing data then developed along two dimensions.
First, there was a natural interest in the relationships between organisms.
The assumption was that random changes occur along all limbs of a genetic tree, but depending on the protein, only some small fraction survives.
If these survival rates were constant, then distances separating existing sequences could be calculated.
A second kind of comparison focused on so-called paralogous proteins, which are descended from a common ancestor within the same creature as a result of gene duplications.
Both types of comparison showed that new proteins come from old ones, just as evolutionary theory would predict.
Duplications of parts of a DNA genome occur constantly in all organisms, mainly as a result of random breakage and reunion events.
Most of these duplicated segments are doomed to oblivion, because any proteins their genes produce are redundant.
Occasionally, however, a slightly modified gene product proves adaptively advantageous, and a new protein is born.
Often its function is very similar to the old one, but occasionally a drastic change occurs.
Then, in 1978, DNA sequencing came into wide use.
Almost immediately, a flood of fresh genetic information overwhelmed the existing protein sequence database.
A second storehouse, GenBank, was established, but initially it concentrated exclusively on DNA sequences.
And yet the interesting information resided in the translated DNA sequences, that is, their protein equivalents.
It was one of those rare moments of opportunity when an amateur could compete with professionals.
So I began my own database, mostly using translated DNA sequences; I called it NEWAT (New Atlas).
Armed with a very primitive computer and some very simple programs written by an undergraduate student, we began matching every new sequence against all previously reported sequences and found many wholly unexpected relationships.
By the time the Human Genome Initiative was launched at the end of the 1980's, the amount of data was no longer the limiting factor in the development of new knowledge; suddenly, managing it was.
Many scientists were skeptical about the human genome project.
The human genome, they pointed out, contained a hundred times more amino acid sequences than the existing databases.
So how would the genes be identified?
How can you match up something that's never been found?
But every gene in a genome is not an entirely new construct, and not all protein sequences are possible--otherwise, the number of different sequences would be vastly greater than the number of atoms in the Universe.
Only a miniscule fraction of possible sequences has ever occurred, through duplication, multiplication, and modification of a small starter set of genes.
As a result, most genes are related to other genes.
I was confident that bioinformatics would enable us to identify all genes merely by sequence inspection. But after the completion of the first dozen microbial genomes, about half the genes remained unidentified--a level that has persisted through the first hundred genomes to be completed, including the human genome.
Even one of the most studied organisms, E. coli , has an abundance of genes whose function has never been found.
Still, the benefits of deciphering genomes have been tremendous.
The promises of quick medical applications may have been over-stated. But the inherent value is immeasurable: the ability to grasp who we are, where we came from, and what genes we humans have in common with the rest of the living world.

Down and Out in Athens and Brussels
NEW YORK – The Greek catastrophe commands the world’s attention for two reasons.
First, we are deeply distressed to watch an economy collapse before our eyes, with bread lines and bank queues not seen since the Great Depression.
Second, we are appalled by the failure of countless leaders and institutions – national politicians, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank – to avert a slow-motion train wreck that has played out over many years.
If this mismanagement continues, not only Greece but also European unity will be fatally undermined.
To save both Greece and Europe, the new bailout package must include two big things not yet agreed.
First, Greece’s banks must be reopened without delay.
The ECB’s decision last week to withhold credit to the country’s banking system, and thereby to shutter the banks, was both inept and catastrophic.
That decision, forced by the ECB’s highly politicized Executive Board, will be studied – and scorned – by historians for years to come.
By closing the Greek banks, the ECB effectively shut down the entire economy (no economy above subsistence level, after all, can survive without a payments system).
The ECB must reverse its decision immediately, because otherwise the banks themselves would very soon become unsalvageable.
Second, deep debt relief must be part of the deal.
The refusal of the rest of Europe, and especially Germany, to acknowledge Greece’s massive debt overhang has been the big lie of this crisis.
Everyone has known the truth – that Greece can never service its current debt obligations in full – but nobody involved in the negotiations would say it.
Greek officials have repeatedly tried to discuss the need to restructure the debt by slashing interest rates, extending maturities, and perhaps cutting the face value of the debt as well.
Yet every attempt by Greece even to raise the issue was brutally rebuffed by its counterparties.
Of course, as soon as the negotiations collapsed two weeks ago, the truth about the Greek debt began to be stated.
The IMF was the first to break the silence, acknowledging that it had been urging debt relief but to no avail.
The United States then let it be known that President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had been trying to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble to offer debt relief to Greece, also without success.
Then even Schäuble himself, by far the staunchest opponent of debt relief, admitted that Greece needed it; but he also claimed that such relief would violate European Union treaty provisions barring bailouts of governments.
Following Schauble’s remarkable acknowledgment (made publicly only after utter catastrophe had struck), Merkel herself opined that perhaps certain kinds of relief (such as cuts in interest rates, rather than in the debt’s face value) could do the job in a way that would be consistent with EU rules.
The fact that the Greek debt overhang was acknowledged only after negotiations had collapsed exposes the deep systemic failures that have brought Greece and Europe to this point.
We see a European system of crisis management that is fraught with ineptitude, extreme politicization, gamesmanship, and unprofessionalism.
I certainly do not mean to excuse Greek clientelism, corruption, and mismanagement as ultimate causes of the country’s predicament.
Yet the failure of the European institutions is more alarming.
Unless the EU can now save Greece, it will not be able to save itself.
The EU today operates something like the US under the Articles of Confederation, which defined the US’s ineffectual governing structure after independence from Britain in 1781 but prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1787.
Like the newly independent US, the EU today lacks an empowered and effective executive branch capable of confronting the current economic crisis.
Instead of robust executive leadership tempered by a strong democratic parliament, committees of national politicians run the show in Europe, in practice sidelining (often brazenly) the European Commission.
It is precisely because national politicians attend to national politics, rather than Europe’s broader interests, that the truth about Greece’s debt went unspoken for so long.
The Eurogroup, which comprises the 19 eurozone finance ministers, embodies this destructive dynamic, meeting every few weeks (or even more frequently) to manage Europe’s crisis on the basis of national political prejudices rather than a rational approach to problem-solving.
Germany tends to call the shots, of course, but the discordant national politics of many member states has contributed to one debacle after the next.
It is the Eurogroup, after all, that “solved” Cyprus’s financial crisis by partial confiscation of bank deposits, thereby undermining confidence in Europe’s banks and setting the stage for Greece’s bank panic two years later.
Amid all this dysfunction, one international institution has remained somewhat above the political fray: the IMF.
Its analysis has been by far the most professional and least politicized.
Yet even the IMF allowed itself to be played by the Europeans, especially by the Germans, to the detriment of resolving the Greek crisis many years ago.
Once upon a time, the US might have pushed through policy changes based on the IMF’s technical analysis.
Now, however, the US, the IMF, and the European Commission have all watched from the sidelines as Germany and other national governments have run Greece into the ground.
Europe’s bizarre decision-making structure has allowed domestic German politics to prevail over all other considerations. And that has meant less interest in an honest resolution of the crisis than in avoiding the appearance of being lenient toward Greece.
Germany’s leaders might rightly fear that their country will be left holding the bill for European bailouts, but the result has been to sacrifice Greece on the altar of an abstract and unworkable idea: “no bailouts.”
Unless some rational compromise is agreed, insistence on that approach will lead only to massive and even more costly defaults.
We are now truly at the endgame.
Greece’s banks have closed, its debt has been acknowledged as unsustainable, and yet the future of both the banks and the debt remains uncertain.
The decisions taken by Europe in the next several days will determine Greece’s fate; wittingly or not, they will determine the EU’s fate as well.

The Wall Blocking the Roadmap
The roadmap to peace between Israelis and Palestinians faces countless bloody detours.
Few Israelis expect Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas to deliver security to Israel, or to implement far reaching political and financial reforms.
Few Palestinians expect Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to deliver what they want: a freeze on the construction and expansion of settlements, and the eventual creation of a truly sovereign Palestinian state on contiguous territory.
In a survey of Israeli and Palestinian opinion of the roadmap, Yaakov Shamir of Hebrew University and I found that only 15% of Palestinians agreed that Sharon would stand by Israel's commitments, while only 30% of Israelis believed that Abu Mazen would hold up the Palestinian end of the agreement.
Security remains the critical component in the first phase of the roadmap for both parties.
The roadmap calls upon the Palestinians to take steps that would bring violence to an end.
One early Palestinian achievement has been a ceasefire agreement among all factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad (although both groups claim the right to retaliate for Israel's ``targeted killings'' of their leaders).
But the roadmap stipulates that additional measures are to be taken by Palestinian authorities, including arresting individuals planning or carrying out violent attacks and the ``dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure,'' including confiscating illegal weapons from armed groups.
The Palestinian security services are discovering that they lack the capacity to do so without risking civil war.
But even if they could disarm the extremists, Palestinians are divided about how far they are willing to go to attain security for Israel.
While the ceasefire remains popular--albeit increasingly tenuous in light of recent events--few Palestinians wish to see the Palestinian Authority permanently break the back of the armed resistance forces.
Many Palestinians view violence as a useful tool in the struggle for independence and do not want to destroy the capability to resort to arms in the future if Israel reneges on its roadmap commitment to end the occupation.
Palestinian opinion offers a different option for restraining Hamas and dismantling the ``infrastructure of violence'': incorporating Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and other factions, into the political process.
For the younger generation of Palestinian political activists, the best hope for independence lies in the emergence of an empowered young guard, incorporating both nationalists and Islamists.
These younger leaders guided the Intifada, gaining stature within Palestinian society, as well as a feeling that they might soon supplant the traditional old guard of the PLO.
Youthful nationalists believe that they will gain outright leadership among Palestinians when they convince moderate young Islamists to abandon Hamas and Islamic Jihad to join with them in ousting the old guard.
But Israelis do not accept this political logic.
For them, such developments look like a trap that would consolidate the ``infrastructure of terror.''
This is where Israel's wall of separation comes in.
They do not want to deal with the Palestinians, and so are erecting a physical barrier through areas that are now nominally under Palestinian control.
While the roadmap speaks volumes about security, it makes no mention whatsoever of the Israeli wall.
Yet the wall and the second phase of the roadmap, which calls for a Palestinian state with provisional borders, cannot co-exist.
Work on the wall started around a year ago.
Initially aimed at creating a security fence along the green line, the 1967 borders of Israel, it has gradually stretched across that would-be boundary, confiscating Palestinian land and amounting to a de facto annexation of a large part of the West Bank.
For example, the planned portion of the wall that reaches the settlement of Ariel, deep inside the West Bank, extends 15 kilometers inside Palestinian territories.
By encircling large parts of the West Bank from the east, covering as much as 50% of Palestinian territory, the wall deprives Palestinians of access to Jordan, their eastern neighbor.
In Palestinian eyes, the wall is a unilateral measure that creates facts on the ground and short-circuits the timing and effectiveness of so-called ``permanent status'' negotiations, which are envisaged in the third phase of the roadmap.
This is because the second phase, which still has to be achieved, calls for a Palestinian state with contiguous but provisional borders.
The projected path of the wall eliminates Palestinian contiguity altogether.
So continuing its construction will kill any Palestinian enthusiasm for the second phase of the roadmap.
Instead, Israelis will have a strong incentive to demand an immediate implementation of the third phase, in other words, to go directly to ``permanent status'' talks.
Permanent status negotiations, dealing with all the major issues of the conflict--including refugees, Jerusalem, settlement, security, water, and, of course, the permanent borders of the Palestinian state--are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2005, while Ariel Sharon is still slated to be Prime Minister.
Immediate resumption of these talks will lead to profound Palestinian despair, much deeper than the disillusion that followed the collapse of the Camp David summit in July 2000.
The roadmap, with its promise of fast achievements in the form of an Israeli settlement freeze and early Palestinian statehood, provides incentives for the Palestinian Authority to deliver security for Israelis on a sustained basis.
If Israel must have its wall, it must also restrict it to the 1967 Green Line.
If not, no wall will be able to contain Palestinian rage.

The Inevitable Re-Birth of European Integration
ATHENS – European integration implies successive transfers of national sovereignty to the Union. But, while member states readily comply with decisions that abolish protective measures – say, import duties – they hesitate to formulate or advance policies that would grant the European Union discretionary powers to take initiatives.
Typical examples of this are the stalled Lisbon Strategy, the incomplete Economic and Monetary Union, and now, following the Irish public’s blocking maneuver, the uncertain fate of the new EU Constitutional Treaty (the “Lisbon Treaty”).
A similar weakness is evident in the EU’s attempt to define itself in the global system.
Energy security, climate change, the rise of China, and the revival of Russia are among the many issues that require effective responses.
Often, however, the EU cannot respond or can do so only slowly, because its structure obstructs quick decisions and fast action.
This structure was appropriate in an era when the free market was practically the only issue that the EU had to confront at the global level. But that era is over.
Change is rendered more difficult by the insufficient democratic legitimacy of EU bodies.
The lack of a direct relationship with Europe’s people deprives these bodies of the pressure required to bring about rapid action and responsive policies.
There is no easy solution to these problems.
Democracy in the EU cannot be guaranteed by the models and rules that apply in the member states.
The scale of the problems makes more elaborate solutions necessary.
When dealing with the EU, member states usually aim for arrangements and regulations that ensure cooperation within agreed-upon frameworks. And, as the Irish referendum showed, they do not readily accept unifying initiatives that would make the EU an autonomous center of power.
But, assuming that the obstacle thrown up by Ireland’s voters can be overcome, experience has shown that the EU’s future evolution will be marked by increasingly centralized power in Brussels and the retreat of individual states.
The lever for this process will continue to be the EU’s central bureaucracy, the mechanism that formulates the member states’ common interests and whose field of action is determined by loose, and periodic, inter-governmental collaboration.
The more responsibilities the Brussels bureaucracy acquires, the more independent it will become.
The prime concern for the EU bureaucracy is to find compromises that meet the wishes of member states, and to accommodate often divergent and contradictory national preferences.
A common will usually emerges without any emphasis on conflicting political tendencies and ambitions.
In fact, de-politicization is seen to be advisable because it allows for the easy achievement of balances.
Bolstering democracy, however, requires emphasizing the political dimension and public debate that is free and open to all.
National forums must make it their concern to discuss common European issues, thereby ensuring information for all, transparency, control, and accountability.
Instituting public debate on European policy throughout the Union will help clarify the aims of the unification project, make common interests apparent, and determine Europe’s institutional shape.
This is why the Lisbon Treaty is so important.
The provisions in the chapter on democratic principles, which concern the EU’s institutions and procedural functions, lay the groundwork for a system that is more open to public debate on EU policies.
The Lisbon Treaty also succeeds in tackling another major weakness of the EU ­– its ineffectiveness.
By means of extensive reforms to the structure, operation, and decision-making processes of EU institutions, the treaty enhances their effectiveness and enables greater dynamism.
True, many ordinary Europeans do not think that Europe should play an important part in global developments.
They believe that foreign policy should be handled by their national governments.
This view is outdated.
Even in bilateral or regional crises, viable solutions are possible only at the supranational level.
The Lisbon Treaty envisages the EU as a highly outward-looking entity on the international stage. But there are limits to what the EU can do, limits determined by the Union’s inter-governmental nature.
Indeed, on crucial issues, it is the 27 members, not the Union, that will decide.
Internally, the treaty takes a big step toward creating a Europe of freedom, security, and justice.
It both sets the normative framework for EU policy and establishes institutions and procedures for policies on border controls, asylum, reception of migrants, and cooperation between judicial and police authorities.
Thus, it creates greater security for people in their everyday lives.
The treaty is less detailed in other areas, particularly in achieving an economic union equivalent to the currency union, because it was simply not possible to reach agreement.
Nonetheless, the Lisbon Treaty paves the way for planning and implementing policies needed to tackle crucial contemporary challenges, such as climate change, energy, research, technology, and tourism.
Whatever Irish voters intended by rejecting the treaty, socio-economic change will continue to force the EU to seek new forms of organization, combining inter-governmental and federal approaches.
For example, the need to adapt the operation of the European Central Bank to a policy of development for Europe, as laid out by the Ecofin Council, is already apparent.
The EMU is evidence of that.
More generally, however the problem of the Irish referendum result is addressed, the EU will gradually acquire its definitive shape on the basis of the ongoing problems that it must address, because as the dimensions of these problems grow, their management will require solid and durable forms of cooperation.

America’s Dangerous Debt Ceiling Debate
NEWPORT BEACH – It has been raised more than 70 times in the last 50 years, mostly without commotion. It must be raised again this summer if the United States government is to continue paying its bills on time.
But now America’s debt ceiling has become the subject of intense political posturing and touch-and-go negotiations behind closed doors. And, obviously, the outcome has implications that go well beyond the US.
As part of America’s system of checks and balances, Congress gets to do more than just approve the annual federal budget. It also sets a limit on how much debt the US Treasury is allowed to issue.
Beyond this ceiling, the government can spend only from current revenues.
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently informed members of Congress that the government will be in this situation on or around August 2.
Having already officially hit the ceiling, the Treasury is moving money around and tapping various pots of unused funds to pay its bills.
In a few weeks, this “flexibility” will be used up.
With the US government now borrowing around 40% of every dollar it spends, a truly binding debt ceiling would immediately force the government to reduce spending radically and in a disorderly fashion.
Politicians across the political spectrum know that such a situation would unsettle an already fragile US economy, severely weaken the dollar, and raise serious concerns about the country's ability to meet its debt-service obligations, including to the many foreign creditors that the US will need in the future.
Yet, in today’s polarized environment in Washington, Republicans and Democrats are unwilling to compromise – or at least to compromise “too early.”
By holding out, Republicans wish to force President Barack Obama’s administration into massive spending cuts.
Democrats respond that such a one-sided approach would be economically harmful and socially unjust.
In the meantime, both sides risk disrupting transfer payments (including to the elderly) and the provision of public services, as well as eroding further America’s global credit standing.
The overwhelming – and sensible – expectation is that the two parties will compromise and raise the debt ceiling before inflicting serious economic and financial dislocations.
The most recent precedent was the bipartisan agreement reached earlier this year on another fiscal issue that threatened to disrupt the normal functioning of government: the absence of a formally approved budget for this year.
A compromise would allow both parties to declare partial victory, for it would likely entail commitments to cut spending and some steps to make taxation more socially just. But, like many last-minute agreements, it would have little durable impact.
In effect, the political system would again be kicking the can down the road, with real progress on necessary fiscal reforms expected only after the November 2012 presidential election.
Two scenarios for the timing of an interim compromise are possible, depending on whether it is a one- or two-step process.
Most observers expect a one-step process for bipartisan agreement before August 2. But politicians may need two steps: an initial failure to agree, and then a quick deal in response to the resulting financial-market convulsions.
In the meantime, the Treasury would temporarily re-prioritize and slow outgoing payments.
This two-step process would be similar to what happened in 2008, when Congress was confronted with another cliffhanger: the Bush administration’s request for $700 billion to prevent a financial-market collapse and an economic depression.
Congress initially rejected the measure, but a dramatic 770-point drop in the stock market focused politicians’ minds, bringing them back to the table – and to agreement.
But the two-step scenario involves incremental risks to the US economy, and to its standing in the global system. And the longer America’s politicians take to resolve the debt-ceiling issue, the greater the risk of an inadvertent accident.
This brings us to a third, and even more unsettling possibility: a longer and more protracted negotiation, resulting in greater disruptions to government entitlement payments, other contractual obligations, and public services.
Creditors would then ask many more questions before adding to their already-considerable holdings of US government debt, generating still more headwinds in a US economy that already faces an unemployment crisis and uneven growth.
The next few weeks will provide plenty of political drama.
The baseline expectation, albeit subject to risk, is that Democrats and Republicans will find a way to avoid disruptions that would damage the fragile US economy, but that the compromise will not meaningfully address the need for sensible medium-term fiscal reforms.
Such political paralysis on key economic issues is increasingly unsettling for the US private sector, and for other countries that rely on a strong US at the core of the global economy.
This helps to explain why so many companies continue to hoard cash, rather than investing domestically, and why a growing number of countries want to diversify gradually away from dependence on the dollar as the reserve currency and on US financial markets for intermediation of their hard-earned savings.
The world economy is hard-wired to the assumption of a strong America, and Americans benefit from this. But the more their politicians argue over the debt ceiling, the greater the risk that the wiring will become irreparably frayed.

Ukraine Will Build Back Better
TORONTO – After 100 days of intense fighting, it is difficult to begin thinking about rebuilding Ukraine when Russian bombs are still raining down on innocent civilians.
But it is precisely during times of crisis and disaster that we must consider what comes next.
Above all, leading Western powers need to play a central role in supporting the country’s reconstruction.
To that end, the European Commission recently proposed establishing a “Rebuild Ukraine” facility to channel grants and loans to the country.
But Ukraine’s large financial needs will require the European Union to identify new funding sources, which should include the Russian central bank’s frozen foreign-exchange reserves, as well as funds previously confiscated from Russian state enterprises and assets seized from sanctioned Russian oligarchs.
Reconstruction experts recommend looking at the rebuilding task through the lens of a natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood.
In the initial triage phase of the response, the government needs to stop the bleeding – as Ukraine is doing.
That means fighting back and ejecting the Russian invaders from the entire country, including the occupied Donbas region and Crimea.
It is becoming clearer by the day that Ukraine’s defenders – whether from the volunteer territorial defense forces or the military itself – have the bravery, resolve, and moral fortitude to win this war.
Unfortunately, Ukraine has so far not received enough military assistance or humanitarian aid to tip the balance decisively in its favor.
The EU announced its reconstruction plan on the same day as some 1,000 Ukrainian fighters were evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol – an economically vital center of Ukraine’s metals production after defending it for over 80 days.
Since Russia launched its brutal invasion on February 24, Ukraine has been fighting this war on Europe’s front line with one hand tied behind its back.
Many of Ukraine’s allies have made grand pronouncements of support, and condemned Russia, but either have not sent or have been inexcusably slow in delivering the weapons Ukraine needs.
Ukrainians are fighting Europe’s war by defending the continent’s values and holding back an imperialist Russia.
Unfortunately, many European states act as if their own security is not also threatened.
Even as Ukrainians fight the invaders, those in liberated areas, such as the towns and villages north of Kyiv, have begun rebuilding their homes and their lives.
But they cannot do it alone.
We are grateful for the estimated €4.1 billion ($4.4 billion) of EU assistance to date, and we welcome the additional €9 billion in macro-financial support recently proposed by the Commission. But this war is costing Ukraine hundreds of millions of dollars a day.
The EU estimates that, by the time the conflict is over, the repair bill for physical infrastructure alone could run to at least €100 billion.
When Ukraine is free again, its industrial hubs, ports, and cities will need to be rebuilt.
The country will need a Marshall Plan-style postwar stimulus package that provides an immediate cash injection to jump-start its economy, as well as jobs for Ukrainians and contracts for European, US, and Canadian firms.
But Ukrainians will not just rebuild what the Russians have destroyed. They will build back better.
Our eventual victory in this war will be an opportunity to turn a disastrous moment in the country’s history into an epic vision of a free, modern, European Ukraine.
By fighting this war, Ukraine has shown that it will be a strong and reliable member of the EU and NATO.
When Ukrainians rebuild their country, they will do so in a way that aligns with the European project. Ukraine will be a lasting demonstration of a tolerant and open society, a country committed to defending its people and values.
Moreover, Ukraine’s reconstruction will adhere to a vision of environmental sustainability.
Part of the country’s European future will include ending its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Ukraine has already begun to integrate its power grid with Europe’s.
As rebuilding gathers pace, policymakers intend to integrate the country’s energy infrastructure fully with European networks, diversify imports, and boost renewables.
In fact, Ukraine will become a clean-energy powerhouse fully in the spirit of the EU’s European Green Deal.
It is encouraging to see that the EU is considering how to help Ukraine rebuild.
Committing to a Marshall Plan for the country will be the best way to show Russian President Vladimir Putin that his brutal aggression will not be rewarded.
I hope that our European and NATO friends realize that supporting Ukraine’s freedom and recovery will benefit global peace, security, and prosperity.
Thwarting Russia’s imperial ambitions and rebuilding Ukraine is a challenge the Ukrainian people must not face alone.

The Perils of Public Media Funding
BUDAPEST – Hungary’s state media corporation, MTVA, operated last year with a budget of roughly $309 million, most of it coming from the government’s coffers.
That means that MTVA – which runs television stations, a radio network, and a news agency – had a daily budget of $846,000.
For a country of just ten million people, that is the definition of a spendthrift quango.
One might assume that MTVA’s financial strength is an exception in an industry plagued by dwindling revenue and broken business models.
But among the world’s state-supported media companies, MTVA’s bloated budget is the norm.
In newsrooms from Serbia to South Africa, taxpayer-generated funding is growing. Unfortunately, while this windfall might be putting more programming on the air, it is only deepening the industry’s woes.
Governments have played a major role in domestic media for decades, using regulation of broadcast frequencies and licensing requirements to shape the market.
Yet, in recent years, governments have also stepped up their budgetary influence. Today, government budget allocations are among the leading sources of media revenue.
Public support is typically delivered in one of three ways.
One method is to levy licensing fees on households, a de facto tax on content.
While public media budgets have not grown everywhere – between 2011 and 2015, for example, funding for public media dropped in 40% of the European Broadcasting Union’s 56 member countries – government cash remains influential.
In January 2017, the Romanian government approved a $360 million budget for state broadcaster SRTV, a massive amount in a country of just 20 million people.
Similar infusions of public money are common elsewhere.
Purchases of advertising are a second method of providing government support.
State spending in this category can be significant.
During the first half of 2013, for example, Malaysia’s government spent $118.5 million more on ads than the next four advertisers combined.
Finally, states often provide cash contributions to struggling media outlets, especially those offering favorable coverage.
In 2014, the government of Montenegro, a country with just 622,000 people, spent $33.6 million on state aid for media outlets.
According to the Center for International Media Assistance, the donations included “generous” support to the “reliably pro-government” newspaper Pobjeda.
Financial contributions will always be welcomed by the media, and especially by cash-strapped independent outlets.
But when funding comes with strings, as government money often does, journalistic integrity can suffer.
In many cases, public media organizations are often little more than government mouthpieces, and authorities regularly meddle in editorial affairs.
Hungary is a case in point.
In 2010, not long after the right-wing populist Fidesz party came to power, government officials fired a number of MTVA journalists who had been critical of Fidesz during the election campaign.
Since then, the authorities have dramatically reshaped media legislation, a move that some fear will “restrict media pluralism in the long term.”
Similar overreach has been reported in Macedonia, where, in 2014, the European Commission criticized the government for using advertising money to cement state control over news content.
There are countless other examples of similar interference in media markets around the world.
Generally, governments tend to finance friendly media outlets, or news organizations that are ready to toe the line.
According to a 2014 report on the future of digital journalism, which I co-edited for the Open Society Foundations, governments used financial pressure to manipulate news organizations in more than half of the markets we examined. No doubt that proportion has only increased in the years since.
More broadly, by favoring docile journalism, or by cutting subsidies to critical media voices, governments are distorting media markets to their advantage.
In 2012, a cash injection from Serbian authorities into the state-controlled news agency, Tanjug, gave it a massive competitive edge over the independent news service Beta.
In Hungary, too, independent journalism is struggling to keep pace with state-funded behemoths.
One example is Atlatszo, an intrepid investigative startup. Funded almost entirely by donations, Atlatszo’s annual budget is less than half of MTVA’s daily allocation.
While public money is reshaping the media business, taxpayers are not the biggest beneficiaries in many countries.
If even a fraction of the budgetary windfall received by state media was redirected to independent news organizations, journalism would thrive and the public would be better informed.
At the moment, however, the biggest winners in the public media marketplace are the governments manipulating a struggling industry.

The Global Economy’s Inevitable Hard Landing
In recent weeks, the global liquidity and credit crunch that started last August has become more severe.
This is easy to show: in the United States, the euro zone, and the United Kingdom, spreads between Libor interest rates (at which banks lend to each other) and central bank interest rates – as well as government bonds – are extremely high, and have grown since the crisis began.
This signals risk aversion and mistrust of counterparties.
To be sure, major central banks have injected dozens of billions of dollars of liquidity into the commercial banking sector, and the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada have lowered their interest rates.
But worsening financial conditions prove that this policy response has failed miserably.
So it is no surprise that central banks have become increasingly desperate in the face of the most severe crisis since the advent of financial globalization.
The recent announcement of coordinated liquidity injections by the Fed and four other major central banks is, to be blunt, too little too late.
These measures will fail to reduce interbank spreads significantly, because monetary policy cannot address the core problems underlying the crisis.
The issue is not just illiquidity – financial institutions with short-term liabilities and longer-term illiquid assets.
Many more economic agents face serious credit and solvency problems, including millions of households in the US, UK, and the Eurozone with excessive mortgages, hundreds of bankrupt sub-prime mortgage lenders, a growing number of distressed homebuilders, many highly leveraged and distressed financial institutions, and, increasingly, corporate-sector firms.
At the same time, monetary injections cannot resolve the generalized uncertainty of a financial system in which globalization and securitization have led to a lack of transparency that has undermined trust and confidence.
When you mistrust your financial counterparties, you won’t want to lend to them, no matter how much money you have.
The US is now headed towards recession, regardless of what the Fed does.
The build-up of real and financial problems – the worst US housing recession ever, oil at $90 a barrel or above, a severe credit crunch, falling investment by the corporate sector, and savings-less and debt-burdened consumers buffeted by multiple negative shocks – make a recession unavoidable.
Other economies will also be pulled down as the US contagion spreads.
To mitigate the effects of a US recession and global economic slump, the Fed and other central banks should be cutting rates much more aggressively, rather than relying on modest liquidity injections that are bound to fail.
The Fed’s 25-basis-point cut in December was puny relative to what is needed; similar cuts by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada do not even begin to address the increase in nominal and real borrowing rates that the sharp rise in Libor rates has induced.
Central banks should have announced a coordinated 50 basis-point reduction to signal their seriousness about avoiding a global hard landing.
Likewise, the European Central Bank’s decision not to cut rates – deluding itself that it may be able to raise them once the allegedly “temporary” credit crunch is gone – is mistaken.
With deflating housing bubbles, high oil prices, and a strong euro already impeding growth, the ECB is virtually ensuring a sharp euro-zone slowdown.
In any case, the actions recently announced by the Fed and other central banks are misdirected.
Today’s financial markets are dominated by non-bank institutions – investment banks, money market funds, hedge funds, mortgage lenders that do not accept deposits, so-called “structured investment vehicles,” and even states and local government investment funds – that have no direct or indirect access to the liquidity support of central banks.
All these non-bank institutions are now potentially at risk of a liquidity run.
Indeed, US legislation strictly forbids the Fed from lending to non-depository institutions, except in emergencies.
But this implies a complex and cumbersome approval process and the provision of high-quality collateral.
And never in its history has the Fed lent to non-depository institutions.
So the risk of something equivalent to a bank run for non-bank financial institutions, owing to their short-term liabilities and longer-term and illiquid assets, is rising – as recent runs on some banks (Northern Rock), money market funds, state investment funds, distressed hedge funds suggests.
There is little chance that banks will re-lend to these non-banks the funds they borrowed from central banks, given these banks’ own severe liquidity problems and mistrust of non-bank counterparties.
Major policy, regulatory, and supervisory reforms will be required to clean up the current mess and create a sounder global financial system.
Monetary policy alone cannot resolve the consequences of inaction by regulators and supervisors amid the credit excesses of the last few years.
So a US hard landing and global slowdown is unavoidable.
Much greater and more rapid reduction of official interest rates may at best affect how long and protracted the downturn will be.

Automation and Human Agency
DUBAI – Nobel laureate Amartya Sen defined human agency as “what a person is free to do and achieve in pursuit of whatever goals or values he or she regards as important.”
At a time of mounting fears over artificial intelligence and job-destroying robotics, the COVID-19 crisis is a powerful reminder that, when it comes to driving an economy, there is no substitute for human agency.
Many view the COVID-19 pandemic as a likely catalyst for further automation.
By highlighting the vulnerability of human workers and amplifying calls for stronger worker protections and benefits like paid sick leave, the crisis could spur businesses in many industries to invest in robots.
But there is no reason to believe that more robots would have saved the economy from a lockdown-induced COVID-19 recession.
Many supply chains were already highly automated, and yet suffered disruptions.
Robot-run and human-staffed production plants alike have been shut down.
The most robot-intensive industries in some of the countries with the highest robot densities (China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United States) are laying off thousands of workers.
The real lesson of the COVID-19 crisis is not that robots are the key to economic dynamism, but that they mean little without human agency.
After all, at the most fundamental level, that is what lockdowns and other social-distancing protocols have eliminated: people’s ability to “do and achieve” what they want.
No matter how fast, cheap, or efficient robots are, they cannot compensate for the human ambition, desire, need, and greed that ultimately drive supply and demand.
That is why, when the crisis erupted, governments did not rush to finance automation, in order to reopen factories without human workers.
Instead, they focused on getting money into people’s pockets and enabling them to continue exercising their agency.
It is time to take this approach further.
The first step is to abandon the prevailing man-versus-machine narrative, with its narrow focus on supply-side efficiency, in favor of a machine-for-man framework, focused on leveraging technological progress to enhance human agency – and, thus, the demand that fuels an economy.
For example, fully automating a factory may boost productivity or reduce labor costs, but it does nothing to strengthen human agency.
On the contrary, by eliminating jobs for human workers – essential to enable them to invest and consume – it could have the opposite effect.
But there are ways to offset that impact – and not only oft-discussed supply-side interventions (such as training to enable displaced workers to fill better jobs), but also demand-focused measures.
For example, advanced last-mile delivery solutions, using unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, would support humans’ agency as consumers.
By improving mobility, technologies like self-driving cars would similarly enhance human agency.
The power of such a machine-for-man model has been evident during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Whereas not even the highest-performing machines have been able to keep factories open, agency-enhancing technologies have generated growth in many sectors toward which demand has been channeled.
Video-conferencing apps, online learning and entertainment, and e-commerce platforms could be just the start of a broader machine-for-man economic transformation.
The same phenomenon can be seen on the supply side.
Companies whose workers can do their jobs remotely have not suffered the same shock as companies that had to suspend operations.
Moreover, workers are often more productive at home than in an office.
In this sense, the more jobs can be performed remotely, the more dynamic – and less vulnerable to shocks – the economy becomes.
Yet, as it stands, only 37% of US jobs can be performed remotely.
In Switzerland, that figure is 45%.
The current crisis is far from the first demonstration of technology’s agency-enhancing power: development studies have highlighted technology’s ability to enable more people to participate in the economy.
But the lockdowns – a third of the world’s population is sitting idle at home – show that agency gained can be suddenly and drastically reduced.
Technology is vital to ensure that, even if freedoms must temporarily be curtailed, humans have opportunities to exercise agency.
As the COVID-19 crisis spurs increased public investment in related research and development, governments have a valuable opportunity to advance that imperative by funding agency-enhancing projects in a range of areas, such as augmented reality and haptic technologies, assisted living, the Internet of Things, and collaborative robots.
Despite all the talk about supply chains, policymakers should look beyond relieving such constraints and consider what it will take to sustain demand amid serious shocks – from disease outbreaks to natural disasters – that impede economic and social activity.
But investment alone is not enough.
To maximize innovation and minimize disruptions, governments should come together to enact the appropriate legal, regulatory, and institutional support systems to guide the development and implementation of new technologies.
While breakthroughs often represent a stroke of genius, ensuring that they serve the public good – including by enhancing human agency – is a matter for us all.

Europe’s Meat Habit and the Global Food Crisis
DENVER/BRUSSELS – European countries are experiencing their worst cost-of-living crisis in decades, owing to surging energy and food costs.
COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and climate change have compounded the increase in commodity prices, leading to food shortages and rapidly rising food insecurity in the developing world.
But there is good news: with a simple (but critical) change in food production, the European Union can ease food-price inflation and bolster global food supplies.
An analysis by consulting firm SYSTEMIQ shows that by cutting meat production by just 13% – the equivalent of European consumers going meat-free for one day a week – the EU could reallocate enough grain and land currently used to feed livestock to offset the 23 million tons of wheat Ukraine produced in 2020.
This should come as no surprise.
After all, meat is a notoriously inefficient source of nutrition.
For every 100 feed calories consumed by cattle, we produce just one beef calorie.
As it stands, we are using vast amounts of land and fertilizers to grow food that only livestock can eat.
Meanwhile, fertilizer prices have soared by 60% in the past year, owing to reduced exports from Russia and Ukraine (which together account for over one-quarter of all fertilizer production) and manufacturing disruptions across Europe caused by soaring gas prices.
“To avert a future crisis, we need to bring fertilizer prices down,” Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), recently warned.
Simply put, the meat industry’s inefficient use of fertilizers drives up food prices, exacerbates world hunger, and pushes farmers into poverty.
Reallocating land from meat production to grains, vegetables, legumes, and alternative proteins would be a far more effective way to feed a growing population on a warming planet.
For example, it takes an average of 48 square meters to produce one gram of beef protein for every square meter needed to produce one gram of protein from peas.
Reducing EU meat production would also provide significant climate benefits.
After all, animal farming generates as many greenhouse-gas emissions as all the world’s cars, trucks, planes, and ships.
According to our calculations, cutting livestock-related emissions by five million tons of carbon dioxide would be the same as removing more than four million new gasoline-fueled cars from Europe’s roads.
Even a relatively modest cut in Europe’s meat production would have a meaningful global impact.
According to the UNCTAD, lower-income countries suffering from acute food insecurity, such as Benin, Somalia, and Laos, are almost entirely dependent on wheat imports from Ukraine and Russia.
Against this backdrop, OECD countries continue to allocate a disproportionate amount of land to feed livestock.
This partly reflects massive overconsumption: the average EU citizen consumes twice as much meat as the global average.
As a result, two-thirds of all cereals in the EU are used for animal feed.
But while diverting grain from livestock to human consumption could prevent major food shortages across the developing world, it would also reduce food insecurity in wealthier countries, which are facing severe food-access issues of their own.
In France, for example, roughly 10% of the population relies on food banks.
European policymakers grappling with rising food and energy prices must combat the global food crisis and climate change by reducing incentives for industrial meat production and creating incentives for plant-based proteins and sustainable meat substitutes.
By spurring a market shift toward more sustainable proteins through initiatives like the EU’s sustainable food-systems framework, policymakers can encourage supermarkets and fast-food restaurants to offer more low-emissions proteins like plant-based meat and other emerging meat substitutes.
Such policies would stimulate investment in European businesses while providing significant environmental and health benefits.
But policymakers must also ensure that farmers are not sidelined. They must take measures to support livestock farmers and encourage them to move away from industrial meat production.
For instance, ranchers and farmers should receive financial incentives to reduce their herds and switch to regenerative agricultural practices. In this way, we can ensure that consumers can access affordable proteins without European farmers losing their livelihoods.
Given the greater frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding and droughts, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, it is hard to imagine that food prices will fall any time soon.
But just as they have learned to turn down the thermostats to reduce their dependence on Russian gas, Europeans can eat less meat.
Saving millions of vulnerable people from famine is surely worth such a modest effort.

The New Delhi Consensus
NEW DELHI – One of the more remarkable (though largely unremarked) developments in recent Indian politics has been the startling shift in the country’s discourse about capitalism.
As in many developing countries, “self-reliance” and economic self-sufficiency were India’s national mantras after independence – and, in India’s case, remained so for more than four decades.
Whereas most Westerners axiomatically associate capitalism with freedom, India’s nationalists associated it with slavery.
After all, the British East India Company, that harbinger of capitalism, had come to trade and stayed to rule.
One of the lessons that history teaches us is that history often teaches us the wrong lessons.
For India’s nationalist leaders, this meant that every foreigner with a briefcase should be viewed as the thin edge of a neo-imperial wedge.
This had serious implications for India’s role in the world economy.
Instead of integrating India into the global capitalist system, as only a handful of post-colonial countries – for example, Singapore – chose to do, India’s leaders (and those of most former colonies) were convinced that the political independence that they had fought for could be guaranteed only through economic independence.
As a result, self-reliance became the official credo, protectionist barriers went up, and India spent 45 years largely divorced from global trade and investment flows.
Bureaucrats, not businessmen, controlled the “commanding heights” of the economy, and India shackled itself to statist controls that emphasized distributive justice over economic growth, stifled free enterprise, and discouraged foreign investment.
While the “Asian tigers” roared ahead, the Indian economy sputtered along, growing at a 2-3% annual rate.
Economists spoke derisively of a “Hindu rate of growth.”
“Self-reliance” guaranteed both political freedom and freedom from economic exploitation.
The result was that for most of the first five decades after independence, India, despite the best of intentions, pursued an economic policy of subsidizing unproductivity, regulating stagnation, and redistributing poverty.
We called this socialism.
Indian-style socialism was a compound of nationalism and idealism.
It embodied the conviction that goods and services vital to Indians’ economic well-being must remain in Indian hands – and not in the hands of Indians seeking to profit from producing and selling such goods and services, but rather in the disinterested hands of the state, the father and mother to all Indians.
Given this mindset, performance was not a relevant criterion for judging the utility of the public sector.
Inefficiencies were masked by generous subsidies from the national treasury, and a combination of vested interests – socialist ideologues, bureaucratic managers, trade unions, and monopolies – kept it beyond political criticism.
The “permit-license-quota” culture of statist socialism allowed politicians and bureaucrats to use public service as a vehicle for private gratification, giving birth to a culture of corruption that still persists.
India’s misfortune, in the economist Jagdish Bhagwati’s famous aphorism, was to be afflicted with brilliant economists.
Add to that clamorous politicians and growing demands on a national economic pie that decades of protectionism prevented from growing.
It is impossible to quantify the economic losses inflicted on India during four decades in which entrepreneurs frittered away their time and energy applying for licenses rather than manufacturing products; paying bribes instead of hiring workers; wooing politicians instead of understanding consumers; and “getting things done” through bureaucrats rather than doing things for themselves.
It was only after a massive balance-of-payments crisis in 1991, when India’s government literally had to ship its gold reserves to London to serve as collateral for an International Monetary Fund loan, that India liberalized its economy under then-Finance Minister (now Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh.
In Indian culture, the gold possessed by a household’s women has often been seen as a guarantee of the family’s honor; surrendering the nation’s gold to foreigners was a national humiliation that the old protectionism could not survive.
Since then, India has become a poster child for globalization.
A country whose share of global trade had fallen from 2% in 1947 to 0.2% by 1987 decided to open up to the world economy.
Foreign investment, once viewed as a threat, was now seen as a lifeline.
The revolution in information technology connected India’s bright young white-collar workers to Western employers and clients; IT and IT-enabled services, call centers, and business process outsourcing operations became the hallmarks of the new Indian economy.
The rate of GDP growth more than tripled, averaging more than 9% per year from 2005 to 2007.
It is now widely accepted across the political spectrum that India’s growth and prosperity would be impossible without the rest of the world.
The young generation has grown up with liberalization, and will not accept its rollback.
Young Indians today are likely to spend a lot of their adult lives interacting with people who don’t look, sound, dress, or eat like them.
Unlike their parents, they may well work for an internationally oriented company with clients, colleagues, or investors around the globe; and they are increasingly likely to take their holidays in far-flung destinations.
The change has now been deeply internalized.
Three different coalitions have led India’s government since 1991, including one (from 1996 to 1998) that included Communists, and none has departed from the new “New Delhi” consensus.
In his historic budget speech to Parliament in 1991, Singh, quoting Victor Hugo, declared that “no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come.”
His words were prophetic.
The liberalization of the Indian economy, and of the Indian political mind, has proved irreversible.
Its time has come, and will not pass.

The Nigerian Crucible
LAGOS – Nigeria’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, who was elected only eight months ago, is already swimming in a sea of troubles.
On January 1, New Year celebrations were abruptly cut short when Nigerians woke up to learn that the government gasoline subsidy had been withdrawn.
The country’s poor immediately hit the streets, already angry because their corrupt and incompetent government has been unable to repair state-owned refineries, thereby forcing Africa’s largest oil producer to import petroleum products.
To ordinary Nigerians, the fuel subsidy was the only advantage that they derived from the petrodollars that pour into the national treasury.
Suddenly, politicians, civil servants, and their cronies were embezzling even that benefit.
What began as sporadic protests quickly ballooned into a show of people power in Abuja (the national capital), Lagos (the commercial capital), and Kano (the most populous city in the north), led by the civil-society organizations Joint Action Front and Save Nigeria Group.
Other towns and cities also joined in the protests, and Abdulwaheed Omar, President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, called on workers around the country to strike until the government rescinded its decision to remove the subsidy.
Millions complied, paralyzing the economy.
The Jonathan government had calculated that eliminating the subsidy in the midst of the New Year festivities, a time when most Nigerians travel to their home villages, would impede coordinated resistance, so the speed, ferocity, and scope of the demonstrations caught the authorities completely by surprise.
When the protest leaders’ grievances expanded to include the 2012 budget’s lavish provisions for the president and top civil servants, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation’s shady deals, and government corruption, Jonathan realized that he had to back down.
First, he announced a 25% salary cut for all political appointees. This did not impress the protest leaders.
Next, the government promised to eliminate social-services waste.
Finally, in a humiliating retreat, Jonathan retracted his decision on the gasoline subsidy.
Even as Jonathan was struggling to defuse the rage in the streets, Boko Haram – the violent Islamic sect that has been terrorizing the northern part of the country since 2009 – escalated its attacks.
The sect had bombed a church in Madalla, a town on the outskirts of Abuja, on Christmas Day, killing 45 worshippers, and its spokesmen then demanded that all Christian southerners residing in the north leave.
The government responded by declaring a state of emergency in several of Nigeria’s northern states.
In apparent retaliation, on January 21, Boko Haram launched a daylight attack on government facilities in Kano, including several police posts, killing an estimated 160 people.
A key Boko Haram member, suspected of masterminding the Madalla bombing, then escaped from police custody, suggesting collaboration between security officials and sect members.
Indeed, an increasingly embattled Jonathan recently declared that his own cabinet, in addition to the security agencies, is riddled with “Boko Haram sympathizers.”
In desperation, his national security adviser, Owoeye Andrew Azazi, has called on the United States to declare the sect a terrorist organization and to provide the Nigerian government with counter-terrorism assistance.
Government officials have also held meetings with officials at the Israeli embassy, who have expressed willingness to help the country in its self-declared “war against terror.”
But critics of the government, including several respected public intellectuals, have pointed out similarities between Boko Haram and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, an armed militant group in the country’s oil-rich region, which has been killing soldiers and kidnapping foreign oil workers since 2006.
Both groups are led by impoverished youths, angry at official indifference to low living standards, with a majority of Nigerians living on less than two dollars per day since the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) took power following the end of military rule in 1999.
Moreover, there is mounting evidence that several of the Boko Haram sympathizers against whom Jonathan railed are members of the PDP’s northern faction.
The northerners are angry that Jonathan, a southerner, beat them to the presidency last year, and they see the sect as a useful instrument with which to intimidate him into ceding the office in 2015.
Neither Jonathan nor his northern adversaries enjoy much popular support.
Jonathan is now widely viewed as weak and indecisive, while the PDP’s conservative faction in the north is understood to be part of the “cabal” that has misgoverned the country and looted its treasury since independence in 1960.
With a corrupt and rudderless government, Africa’s most populous country has resumed its dance on the edge of the precipice.
Its poor and powerless citizens, angrily demanding transparency and accountability, do not want the country to disintegrate into its many squabbling ethnic parts. But its rich and powerful, who have already plunged the country into a bloody civil war once, appear ready to do it again.

Africa’s Defining Challenge
ADDIS ABABA – Africa has the youngest population in the world, and it’s growing fast.
By 2055, the continent’s youth population (aged 15-24), is expected to be more than double the 2015 total of 226 million.
Yet the continent remains stubbornly inhospitable – politically, economically, and socially – to young people.
The success of African governments’ efforts to address this will be the single most important factor determining whether the continent prospers or suffers in the coming decades.
A business-as-usual approach would risk exposing Africa not only to economic underperformance and a brain drain, but also to criminality, political and social unrest, and even armed conflict.
But Africa can thrive if its governments act now to tap the energy and dynamism of the burgeoning youth population.
What is needed is a comprehensive policy agenda, comprising demographically informed measures that address political, cultural, and economic exclusion in a synchronized manner.
This will be no small feat, not least because of the massive age gap between Africa’s young majority and their leaders: the average age of an African president is 62, while the median age of Africa’s population is 19.5.
That is the world’s largest age gap between governors and the governed, and it raises concerns about how well decision-makers understand the needs and aspirations of young people.
It does not help that a tradition of gerontocracy prevails in many countries, meaning that young people’s political participation and influence is restricted on cultural grounds.
To help overcome this barrier, governments should treat generational inequality with the same sense of urgency as other forms of inequality, accelerating efforts to introduce youth quotas for political parties, parliaments, and other decision-making institutions.
Much work also remains to be done on the economic front.
According to the African Development Bank, 12 million young people entered Africa’s labor force in 2015, but only 3.1 million jobs were created.
That means that millions of young people were left without a stake in the economy.
In the short and medium term, it will be virtually impossible to create enough jobs to meet the needs of the unemployed and vulnerably employed.
Africa does not have a large labor-intensive manufacturing sector to absorb its mushrooming young population.
But there are programs that can help.
For example, YouthConnekt Africa, launched by the United Nations Development Programme and the government of Rwanda, encourages youth-friendly policies, such as access to finance and skills development, that match the needs of the market in particular countries.
Still, given the dearth of opportunities at home, many young Africans view migration as a chance for social mobility.
Yet, as the CEO of a major company based in Sub-Saharan Africa recently lamented to me, acquiring work visas for Africans is extremely difficult.
In fact, it can be easier to get a work visa for a British citizen than for, say, a Ghanaian with the same skills.
Africa’s vision for economic integration, as set out in the African Union’s Agenda 2063, cannot be realized without labor migration that creates African careers paths for young people.
It is telling that so many Africans are willing to risk drowning in the Mediterranean Sea, living in appalling detention centers in North Africa, or sleeping in public parks in European cities, rather than remaining in Africa.
Yet, contrary to popular belief, young people are not migrating from Africa exclusively for economic reasons. Rather, they are motivated by the promise of opportunities for genuine self-improvement and the freedom to decide who to be and how to live.
That is certainly what led me to leave Africa and head to Europe at a young age.
In fact, the desire for self-improvement through migration is a key element of the human story – one that no desert, sea, or artificial barrier has been able to quell.
Political and cultural exclusion intensifies it.
Given this, any strategy that does not address the broader environment of marginalization is a bridge to nowhere.
So far, Africa seems to be sleepwalking into a future of lost opportunity and, potentially, serious instability.
And Africa’s international partners have remained preoccupied with containing migration from the continent, rather than addressing its underlying causes.
But there may be reason for hope.
The fifth European Union-Africa Summit, to be held later this year, will focus squarely on the continent’s young people.
Likewise, the African Union’s theme for 2017 is “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend Through Investments in Youth.”
One hopes that the growing recognition of the need to create opportunities for young people leads to effective, solidarity-based initiatives that address the barriers to youth empowerment on the continent, instead of erecting barriers to prevent young people from leaving.
To paraphrase Martin Luther King, Africa confronts the fierce urgency of now.
There is such a thing as being too late.

How Chinese Competition Helps Western Conglomerates
MUNICH – In November, the US industrial powerhouse General Electric (GE) announced that it would split into three companies.
The Japanese conglomerate Toshiba and health-care giant Johnson & Johnson have since announced similar plans.
And these are just the latest in a string of such breakups, which include the likes of DowDuPont and Siemens.
Is the age of the conglomerate coming to an end?
While tech companies such as Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, and Meta (formerly Facebook) focus on acquisitions, conglomerates increasingly view breaking up and streamlining their businesses as a way to improve performance.
GE stock, for example, has been underperforming for years.
Shareholders are betting that its health-care, aviation, and energy divisions will be able to reap higher profits and compete more effectively over the next century if they can set their own paths, with more focused business models, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility.
This approach seems to have worked for Siemens, which credits deconglomeration with helping it to overtake GE, its historical rival, and post healthy profits for 2021.
But the question remains: Why are conglomerates underperforming?
The answer comes down to the so-called conglomerate discount.
Markets tend to undervalue the stock of companies with a diversified set of businesses.
If each of their divisions was valued at the level of a single-focus firm in their sector, they would be worth more overall.
The conglomerate discount reflects the fact that conglomerates have lower Tobin’s Q – the ratio between a physical asset’s market value and its replacement value – than single-product firms.
This is partly because capital is often misallocated across divisions.
When headquarters over-allocate to some divisions, the firm’s return on assets declines.
The conventional wisdom is that this misallocation of capital is a result of “corporate socialism” – when head offices allocate capital from more profitable to less profitable divisions, in order to give the underperforming division the resources and incentives to improve.
But, as my co-authors and I show in recent research, that is not the whole story.
In fact, head offices are more likely to over-allocate capital to a conglomerate’s best-performing divisions.
That is because, in deciding where to send more capital, they review proposals from division managers.
Those divisions that promise to bring in the most profits get funded, with the specific amount determined by the estimated costs put forward in the proposal.
But managers are empire-builders, with a strong appetite for running larger divisions, so they often inflate the estimated costs of their projects.
If they are already running the conglomerate’s more profitable divisions, the excess costs will not be enough to prevent headquarters from handing over the funds.
Nonetheless, this arrangement obviously does not imply the most efficient use of capital – hence the conglomerate discount.
Yet abandoning the conglomerate model is hardly the only way to escape this trap.
More market competition can go a long way toward curbing division managers’ empire-building behavior, because it intensifies pressure on headquarters to allocate funds toward the most efficient projects.
This is not mere speculation.
In our research, my co-authors and I find that since China joined the World Trade Organization 20 years ago, US conglomerates facing competition from Chinese firms have benefited from significant reductions in over-reporting of costs by managers.
Over-reporting dropped by 15% per standard deviation increase in Chinese imports, based on 7% average annual growth in imports from China between 1999 and 2007.
Costs fell the most in the companies’ most productive business segments, which had previously been over-reporting by the largest margin.
These segments were then able to increase their output, while less productive business segments continued to underperform, or even contracted.
This meant that the most efficient divisions received the most capital.
These changes led to a sharp decline in firms’ conglomerate discount – a 32% reduction, per standard deviation increase in Chinese imports.
After the 2008 global financial crisis, exporting conglomerates – for which competition from China was strongest – even ended up securing a “conglomerate premium.”
Meanwhile, conglomerates that did not face competition from China saw their conglomerate discount grow.
Superstar firms often have so much market power that they can raise prices without losing many customers, meaning that they often end up delivering too little output at too high a price.
By challenging their monopoly power, China countered these market distortions, compelling conglomerates to increase output and reduce prices.
Firms like GE and Siemens may well find that their decision to split their businesses into multiple companies leads to increased profits and higher stock prices.
But other ailing conglomerates might find that all they really need is a healthy dose of competition.

The Rule of Law Needs a Soul
CAMBRIDGE – The Anglo-American world, once a shining beacon of the “rule of law,” is sliding into constitutional disarray.
In the United States, President Donald Trump’s administration is testing the resilience of the system of checks and balances to the breaking point.
In Brexit Britain, meanwhile, the debate on European Union membership is threatening to rip the country apart, or, worse still, splinter it into pieces.
Although the US and the United Kingdom have very different constitutions – starting with the fact that one is written, and the other not – both involve a subtle interplay of formal laws and informal norms and conventions.
That is why there is no clear interpretation of Article 50 of the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon, which sets out the process by which a member state can leave the bloc.
Similarly, there is no definitive answer to Trump’s query, most recently in the drama surrounding the Mueller report, as to whether collusion with Russia is technically illegal.
Those who drafted the relevant laws, working in good faith, never imagined that cases like this would arise.
But although few anticipated the current constitutional mess, many of the problems stem from the prevailing account of the rule of law in Western legal scholarship.
While correct in regarding the existence of the rule of law as a triumph, it is mistaken in taking this state of affairs for granted.
The hubris of much liberal thinking about the law has been to assume that once a rule-of-law regime is in place, it will be almost perpetually self-sustaining.
But a constitution by itself can no more guarantee a cohesive society than a marriage contract can ensure a lifetime of true love and epic romance.
There is no getting away from doing the work to make the arrangement happy, peaceful, prosperous, and secure.
Societies, like couples, benefit from renewing their vows.
The cracks appearing in the constitutional order on both sides of the Atlantic are evidence of fundamental flaws in our theory of institutions.
Liberal legalism prides itself on its value neutrality, and on placing largely self-interested individuals at its center.
But these assumptions are difficult to reconcile with important aspects of human nature as it is now.
Rules are much more likely to gain traction if they appeal to what psychologists call “the moral machinery.”
In the schema proposed by Princeton Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, this means appealing to human beings’ “System 1” thinking, which is based on emotion and instinct, as well as to the more deliberative or logical “System 2.”
Moreover, by stressing “me” almost entirely at the expense of “we,” liberal theory ignores the fact that humans are inherently and fundamentally social – and risks bringing about a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Indeed, the work of biologist Joseph Henrich demonstrates that the capacity for cooperation has been the main force propelling the human evolutionary process forward.
An increasing body of evidence suggests, however, that sustaining human cooperation across large networks is hard.
My own empirical research has highlighted the difficulties of trying to establish rule-of-law regimes in postcolonial countries or transition economies.
And in the cognitive sciences, evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar has argued that the human brain can optimally process a social network of no more than about 150 people.
This does not mean that any attempt to create large-scale governance structures is doomed to fail.
As Ara Norenzayan argues in Big Gods, religion has succeeded in that regard for centuries.
The lesson, rather, is that even in secular contexts, the creation of a shared narrative is essential to help support institutions.
Just like any other emotionally salient relationship or friendship, this narrative must be maintained through acts of togetherness – even including laughing and singing, according to Dunbar.
Widespread pro-social behavior is possible, but it needs to be “evoked,” as Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker argues, by a culture that actively appeals to the “better angels of our nature.”
Political leaders can do much to build a sense of togetherness, as New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has shown following the massacres at two mosques in Christchurch in March.
Sadly, institutions in the US and the UK have ignored the growing decay of civil society, though it was documented nearly two decades ago in Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam’s evocatively titled book Bowling Alone.
As a result, the law has been reduced to a system of amoral constraints that can be gamed.
Contrary to former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s famous proclamation, there is such a thing as society.
But by persisting with a narrow view of institutions that is devoid of social context, we risk making them too rigid to survive.
And without a sense of community, constitutions can become dangerously brittle – especially as populist leaders rush to fill the void in values by stoking tribal sentiment.
The vitriol of politicians such as Trump or the Brexit avatar Nigel Farage poses a grave danger to long-standing institutions.
Both the US and the UK need leaders who emphasize a culture of cooperation rather than race-to-the-bottom competition, and who actively foster a collective credo.
The West needs to fetishize formal institutions less, and promote civic friendship more.
We should place less emphasis on the purely procedural, and more on people.
By giving the rule of law a soul, we can start the long process of restoring our political systems to health.

The World Bank Must Change Course
BRUSSELS – Critics have called new World Bank president David Malpass an arsonist in charge of a fire department, because of past comments he made on Bank salaries and loans to China.
But it’s far more important to focus on improving progress toward the World Bank’s core mission of ending extreme poverty.
In its most recent fiscal year, the Bank dished out nearly $67 billion in financing, investments, and guarantees.
But under the “new course” set by its previous president, Jim Yong Kim, in 2016, the Bank aims to direct more than a quarter of its funding toward climate change.
Moreover, thanks to Kim, the Bank insists that every single dollar it spends must take account of climate change, and it has ended financial support for coal-fired power plants.
The argument for approaching development through the prism of climate change is that rising temperatures exacerbate challenges such as malaria and lack of access to education.
Though this is true, almost all problems impact all others.
An increase in malaria makes children more susceptible to hunger; poor nutrition and a lack of sanitation worsen educational performance; missing school leads to greater poverty; and so on.
The more important consideration is which policy helps the most.Should we help the poor by cutting carbon dioxide emissions now and reducing temperatures a bit in 100 years’ time, or instead focus immediately on malaria and education?
The evidence clearly shows that direct policies are much more effective.
The World Bank’s climate focus is also at odds with what the world’s poorest citizens want.
When the United Nations asked almost ten million people around the world to list their priorities, they emphasized better education and health care, less corruption, more jobs, and affordable food.
Global warming came last out of 16 issues.
Under Kim, the Bank propagated the simplistic idea that fossil fuels are always damaging, coal must be forbidden, and “climate aid” is the solution.
The truth is far more complex.
Fossil fuels do contribute to global warming – but also to prosperity and wellbeing.
One billion people worldwide live in homes that lack the energy to light even a single bulb.
And more than three billion live in countries without reliable, 24-hour energy networks that can power hospitals and factories.
In practice, the World Bank’s policy of ditching fossil fuels and adopting a “climate lens” often means supporting off-grid solar cells that provide only enough power for a single lightbulb or to recharge a mobile phone.
In some places, that can be important. But in most situations, off-grid cells are useless for tackling the main power challenges of the world’s poor.
No country in history has become prosperous and globally competitive through off-grid energy.
Every high-income economy relies on abundant, cheap, and mostly fossil fuel-driven energy.
At the same time, three billion people currently suffer from terrible indoor air pollution, because poverty forces them to burn dirty fuels such as wood and dung to cook and keep warm.
But solar panels cannot power clean stoves or heaters, or refrigerators that would stop vaccines and food from spoiling.
Nor can they power the agricultural and industrial machinery that supports jobs and pathways out of poverty.
In that respect, distributing solar panels is mostly a way for rich people to feel good about taking action on global warming.
Rich and poor countries alike use coal because it is often still the cheapest, most dependable source of energy.
The International Energy Agency estimates that even by 2040, new solar and wind power will still be more expensive in all major markets than existing coal, after the intermittent production of green energy is taken into account.
Similarly, a Copenhagen Consensus study looked at the effects of building coal-fired power plants in Bangladesh.
The study estimated that these plants would cause global climate damage worth $0.6 billion over the next 15 years.
That’s not trivial.
But by increasing the energy available for industrial development, the project would generate total benefits of $258 billion – about 500 times greater than the damages. As a result, the average Bangladeshi would be 16% richer by 2030.
The project could afford to offset emissions and still be hugely effective.
These are the calculations the World Bank should make.
By denying a loan that would finance such coal-fired power plants, the Bank would avoid 23 cents of costs while foregoing $100 of development benefits.
That’s neither moral nor sensible.
There is a direct connection between power supplies and prosperity.
The World Bank itself recently published a study suggesting that living in a community with power shortages reduces a person’s chances of employment by 35%-41%.
And unsurprisingly, another study showed that distributing solar panels has no measurable impact beyond providing some electricity, and does not increase savings, spending, employment, income, or educational access for children.
The world will reduce its reliance on fossil fuels only when genuine alternatives are cheaper and better.
This will require innovative research and development to bring the price of green energy below that of fossil fuels. The World Bank could even play a role in supporting this.
But Malpass must first refocus the Bank on its core mission.
Despite its poorly considered climate focus, the Bank does a lot of important work.
Malpass should ensure that it concentrates on its most effective initiatives – including freer trade, combating tuberculosis, early childhood nutrition, family planning, and computer-aided education.
The new World Bank president has a chance to make his mark on a still-valuable organization. He should start by making a renewed commitment to eradicating poverty – including the energy poverty that wrecks so many lives.

Russia’s Lawless Legality
MOSCOW – Colonel Yuri Budanov is a convicted rapist and murderer.
After serving half his prison sentence for the rape and murder of an 18-year-old Chechen, Elsa Kungayeva, he was released last December.
Svetlana Bakhmina was a lawyer at Yukos, the oil company formerly run by Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
In 2004, she was arrested and, in 2006, sentenced to six and a half years on embezzlement and tax fraud charges.
Like Budanov, she applied for early release from prison in 2008.
Her request was refused, as was her earlier plea in 2006 to suspend her sentence until her two small sons reached the age of 14 – a request she was entitled to make under Russian law.
Vasily Aleksanyan was Executive Vice President of Yukos, and, as a lawyer, defended Khodorkovsky and his partner, Platon Lebedev, after their arrest in 2003.
He was subsequently disbarred and was himself arrested in April 2006.
By that time, Aleksanyan was critically ill with AIDS, for which treatment was withheld.
In December 2008, the Moscow City Court approved his release on bail of 50 million rubles (around $1,775,000 at the time).
Finally, consider Khodorkovsky and Lebedev themselves.
Arrested in 2003, they were sentenced in 2005 to eight years in prison on charges of tax fraud.
They are serving their sentence in Chita on the Chinese border, although Russian law prescribes that, for the crimes with which they were charged, they were entitled to be imprisoned near their place of domicile, i.e., in Moscow.
When Dmitry Medvedev was elected as Russia’s president a little more than a year ago, he promised to do away with the “legal nihilism” in Russia.
Although he was a close confidante of Vladimir Putin and probably was able to assume presidential office exclusively for that reason, many dared to hope that he would stop the vendetta against Khodorkovsky and all those who had been close to him.
Disillusion fully set in only one year after Medvedev’s election, when a new case against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev was brought, this time for embezzlement of billions and money laundering.
A cynical observer remarked at the preliminary hearing that by the looks of it the Russian authorities couldn’t make up their mind: either the former Yukos bosses didn’t pay taxes or they embezzled money.
But since when does one pay taxes on embezzled funds?
The courtroom where the new trial against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is taking place is slightly larger than a spacious classroom. And it is full of heavily armed guards.
Despite this, the two defendants are forced to sit inside a narrow cage whose glass front has only two small holes through which their lawyers can communicate with them.
Every day, they are brought into the courtroom handcuffed like dangerous felons.
One cannot help but contrast this with Budanov, the rapist and murderer who is now free to move about Russia at will.
The judge refused without comment requests by the defense to remove the cage and to replace one of the prosecutors, who had already been a prosecuting counsel during the first trial.
So the authorities’ aim seems clear: put Khodorkovsky and Lebedev away for a much longer time – more than 20 years if they are convicted.
Few doubt that they will be.
Still, this new trial of course is also a test case for Medvedev’s presidency.
So far, he has done nothing to counteract the legal nihilism against which he himself has spoken.
But maybe he will in the course of this trial, which resembles a personal vendetta even more than the first one did.
To be sure, Khodorkovsky is no saint.
Like many others in Russia who are allowed to enjoy their wealth in peace today (or maybe are lamenting its loss due to the financial crisis), he made his money in thoroughly obscure ways during the early post-Soviet years.
But, instead of buying villas, yachts, or soccer clubs abroad, he invested his fortune in Russia.
Of course, he did mainly fill his own pockets – and his social and political activities certainly were not entirely altruistic, either.
But what made him public enemy number one for Putin was his desire to move Russia in a political direction that he viewed as positive and desirable.
It was his ambition to subject the country to truly far-reaching social and political reforms that sealed his downfall and also brought about this new trial, which appears intended to silence him for good.
Medvedev’s presidency will inevitably be measured by this case.
Will he tolerate and endorse his prime minister’s personal aversions, or is he willing to put an end to the infamous spectacle of a judicial process that has been manipulated and abused from beginning to end?
Little speaks for the latter scenario, but Russia has always been a country where hope dies last.

Free Speech on Trial
Not so long ago, there was jubilation that the free world and its values had prevailed in the Cold War.
When the Communist empire collapsed, some even announced that the victory of liberty and democracy implied the “end of history.”
But history never bowed out; at most, it only took a decade-long intermission, with its next act heralded by the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001.
And here the plot has thickened.
Instead of rejoicing in the liberal order, those of us who have the pleasure of living under it have had to struggle to keep it intact and strong.
Since 9/11, more and more freedoms are being restricted in the name of defending liberty.
New visa requirements and other obstacles to travel, more intimate data collected by governments, and the presence of video cameras everywhere – at once benign and intrusive – remind one more of George Orwell’s Big Brother than of John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty.
Britain is not the only country where ancient rights of habeas corpus, of the inviolability of the person, are to be restricted by new legislation that, for example, extends the permissible length of detention without charge.
Now, even the fundamental right of a liberal order, free speech, is under pressure.
Some restrictions are understandable legacies of the past, but must nevertheless be re-examined.
In Austria, the historian David Irving was arrested recently because he has denied that the Holocaust happened.
In the prison library, however, Irving found two of the books he had written that had led to his arrest!
In Berlin, there is much concern about the possible desecration of the Holocaust Memorial, although its author, the American architect Peter Eisenmann, takes a relaxed view of what is said and done about his creation.
Other restrictions of free speech have more recent triggers.
In the Netherlands, the shock that arose over the killing of the film maker Theo van Gogh runs deep and has led to demands for legislation against hate speech.
In Britain, proposed legislation concerning incitement to religious hatred and terrorism has led to emotional parliamentary debates – and to doubts about the liberal credentials of Tony Blair’s government.
Can such demands for restricting free speech ever be legitimate?
The first and principled answer must surely be no.
All freedoms can be abused by liberty’s enemies, but in the case of speech, the risk posed by restricting freedom is surely greater.
Moreover, the benefits of tolerating free speech outweigh the harm of abusing it.
Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has demonstrated that free speech even helps mitigate seemingly natural catastrophes like famines, because it reveals the ways in which a few haves exploit the many have-nots.
As the watchdog organization Transparency International reminds us, corruption exposed is in many cases corruption prevented.
These practical consequences are above and beyond the liberating effect of allowing the “marketplace of ideas,” rather than state authorities, to judge people’s expressed views.
Are there really no exceptions to this rule?
The classic example comes to mind of the man who shouts “Fire!” in a crowded theatre.
In the resulting panic, people may be hurt or even killed.
Nowadays, we worry about incitement ­– using free speech to provoke violence.
I do not know how many Islamic leaders preach murder and mayhem in mosques and help recruit suicide bombers from among their congregants; but even if it is only a handful, they pose a question that must be answered.
That answer must be given carefully.
For free societies to flourish, the boundaries of free speech should always be widened rather than narrowed.
In my view, Holocaust denial should not be outlawed, in contrast to the demand for all, or any, Jews to be killed.
Similarly, attacks against the West in mosques, however vicious, should not be banned, in contrast to open encouragement to join suicide death squads.
What about the mere praise of “martyrs” who have died while murdering others?
The boundary between implicit and explicit incitement is not easily drawn, but, again, it should be wider rather than narrower.
Free speech is immensely precious, and so is the dignity and integrity of humans.
Both require active and alert citizens who engage what they do not like rather than calling for the state to clamp down on it.
Direct incitement to violence is regarded – as it should be ­– as an unacceptable abuse of free speech; but much that is disagreeable about the David Irving’s and the hate preachers does not fall into this category.
Their rants should be rejected with argument, not with police and prisons.

The Middle East’s Hair Trigger
TEL AVIV – Across the Middle East, a fatalistic conventional wisdom is taking hold: war is unavoidable.
Some see war as a way of resolving an increasingly deadlocked situation, shaking up a dysfunctional regional order whose main actors are not only at loggerheads, but are also incapable of resolving the legitimacy deficits of their respective regimes.
A volley of incendiary remarks between Israel and both Syria and Hezbollah has fueled anxieties about the possibility of war on Israel’s northern border.
The level of sensitivity is such that the latest tension was initiated by the Syrians, who misinterpreted as a threat Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak’s call to start peace negotiations precisely in order to prevent “an all-out regional war.”
Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, for the first time explicitly warned the Israelis that a new round of conflict would no longer be confined to an Israeli-Lebanese showdown, but would involve the entire regional “axis of confrontation” – Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas.
This would also be the case if Israel unleashed its Air Force against Iran’s nuclear installations.
Moreover, Nasrallah made it clear that Israel’s “Dahyia Doctrine” of total devastation of Lebanon in case of war would be answered in kind.
The prospect of a Middle East conflagration has prompted an airlift of senior American officials to Israel to warn of the devastating consequences that an Israeli attack on Iran might have.
Indeed, the Obama administration’s main challenge these days is not peacemaking, but regional conflict management and preemption.
CIA Director Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen have already come and gone, with Vice President Joe Biden and a high-level delegation of the State Department and the National Security Council due in Jerusalem in early March.
But preventing war will not be easy, because Barack Obama’s mystique has worn off in the Arab world.
The expectation that he would allow the Arabs, particularly the Syrians and the Palestinians, to recover their land without resorting to arms has been proved, by his own admission, to be unrealistic.
Nor has he been able to rein in Iran’s relentless drive for regional hegemony, or convince it to abandon its quest for nuclear arms.
Israel will most likely listen to America’s advice and consider a preemptive attack on Iran only after all diplomatic means have been exhausted, and after whatever sanctions are agreed upon fail to cut short Iran’s march toward possessing the bomb.
No matter how unjustified Israel’s traditional military behavior seems in the eyes of its enemies and critics, it has always aspired to base its military actions on grounds that can be justified.
This would seem to be particularly true when it comes to an attack on Iran’s nuclear installations.
Israel would not like to be seen as the spoiler of a diplomatic solution to a dispute that in any case cannot be resolved by military means alone.
Wars in the Middle East, it should be recalled, have started even when the parties did not really want them.
The 1967 war is one example.
Today’s anxieties, too, are fed by perceptions and fears, by real and imagined concerns.
The Iranian challenge to Israel’s strategic hegemony is presented as a Holocaust-style existential threat, and Israel’s other enemies – Hezbollah, which believes that it can bring about “the end of the Zionist entity,” and Syria, which publicly boasts of its ballistic missiles’ capacity to destroy Israel’s main urban centers – are similarly viewed as irrational actors.
A covert war between Israel and Iran has been going on for some time now.
The assassinations – allegedly by Israel – of Imad Mughniyah, Hezbollah’s military chief and Iran’s closest ally in the organization, two years ago, and more recently of Mahmoud al-Mahbouh, Hamas’s liaison officer with the Al-Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, suggest that an unplanned chain of events could trigger a real war.
The Lebanese front may ignite if Hezbollah seeks to avenge Mughniyah’s death, or simply as a result of a knee-jerk reaction to a provocation, as in 2006.
If Iran and Syria then decide to back Hezbollah, a direct Israeli-Iranian showdown could follow.
What Israel planned as a preemptive attack on Iran might then be presented as an act of self-defense .
General James Jones, President Obama's national security adviser, recently put forward a different, albeit equally ominous, prediction.
Iran's response to the mounting international pressure might be, he said, to launch an attack on Israel through its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas.
Such attacks might trigger a wider regional conflagration.
War threats in the Middle East should never be dismissed as hollow.
Prophecies of war, moreover, have too frequently proven themselves to be self-fulfilling.
But America’s extraordinary efforts to rein in Israel might not be enough to avert a calamity.
The days of Pax Americana in the region are over, which means that avoiding a regional explosion will require mobilizing the major international actors that favor diplomatic solutions for the Arab-Israeli conflict and for Iran’s quest to become a legitimate partner in a new regional system.

Italy’s Old New Populism
CANBERRA – Italy’s coalition government, comprising the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League party, made headlines recently for its new draft budget, which violates European Union rules.
But this is hardly the first Italian government to make over-the-top promises and squander public money to pay for them.
In fact, when all is said and done, Italy’s new populism is not new at all.
The government’s proposed budget promises to increase borrowing to finance a 2.4%-of-GDP deficit in 2019 and the following two years.
While this would not cross the EU’s 3%-of-GDP ceiling on budget deficits, it is considerably more than the 1.6% that the finance minister informally agreed with the EU over the summer.
For Italy, which suffers from deep structural issues and chronically anemic growth, increasing the target for the 2019 budget deficit is imprudent, to say the least.
By worsening Italy’s already fragile fiscal position, the higher deficit will limit the scope for adjustment in the event of future shocks.
Italy’s sovereign debt already totals more than 130% of its GDP – the second-highest ratio in the EU (after Greece).
To put the country on a path toward public-debt sustainability, the country should be increasing its primary surplus (the difference between revenues and expenditures net of interest payments), to 3.5-4% of GDP, according to the Bank of Italy.
Instead, the primary surplus is due to drop to 1.3% of GDP in 2019, from the projected 1.9% this year, making it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the planned debt reduction.
Long-term economic and social considerations almost inevitably collide with short-term political objectives, particularly for populists.
Increasing spending today is the only way Italy’s coalition parties can deliver on their grand campaign promises.
Whereas M5S has pledged a form of “citizens’ income” for the poor and the League is committed to tax cuts, both want to repeal the 2011 pension reform that, among other things, raised the retirement age.
For the League, delivering on its electoral pledges is particularly urgent, as it is eager to cement its lead against its former center-right allies – notably, Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia – and even M5S before next year’s European Parliament elections.
To be sure, Italy’s ruling coalition is responding, at least partly, to real and serious concerns.
The global financial crisis and ensuing eurozone crisis lowered many households’ living standards considerably, and some five million people now in absolute poverty.
Real disposable income per capita dropped precipitously in 2009-2012, and remains below pre-crisis levels, which were already below the prevailing levels prior to Italy’s adoption of the euro.
And with older households’ real income (and wealth) well above those levels, aggregate data do not capture how grim the situation has become for younger and middle-age households.
But simply throwing €10 billion ($11.5 billion) at the problem will not fix it.
M5S’s “citizen’s income” will not be sufficient to lift people out of poverty, and it could actually worsen their plight to the extent that it distracts attention from the fragmented and poorly targeted welfare system, not to mention the need for broader structural reforms.
As it stands, Italy lags behind other large European economies in terms of output, employment, and income growth, with wages failing to keep up even with the country’s abysmally low productivity gains.
Rather than offering Band-Aids, the ruling coalition should be working to boost Italy’s competitiveness, which has been undermined since the crisis by the weak recovery of real exports and low investment, which, at under 9% of GDP, remains significantly below the eurozone average.
Even the League’s own voters are unlikely to buy into the citizen’s income program, owing to the perception that it would feed a culture of dependency and entitlement that many of them oppose.
And, in fact, the coalition’s fissures are beginning to show.
For now, the League and M5S remain united by their determination to defend Italy’s sovereignty against EU efforts to undermine it.
After spending weeks arguing with EU leaders about migration, the government is now challenging the Maastricht Treaty’s rules, all in an effort to maintain popular support.
But here, again, short-term political interests are at odds with long-term economic imperatives.
In a world where capital flows across borders instantly, rigid notions of sovereignty are not only inappropriate, but also dangerous, not least because they stoke fears among international investors.
As Argentina’s experience starkly demonstrates, international investors’ mistrust of populist governments can result in upheaval: as they withdraw their funds, a sovereign-debt crisis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Italy is not there yet, but since the end of May, yields on its ten-year sovereign bonds have increased by about 210 basis points, bringing the differential with the German bund to over 270 basis points.
And all the ingredients for a crisis are there: a weak growth outlook, a poor and deteriorating fiscal position, a vulnerable banking sector with substantial sovereign-debt exposure, and no credible plan for needed structural reform.
If those in Italy’s government who advocate a departure from the eurozone get their way, the situation will become even more explosive, owing to widespread economic destabilization and the destruction of confidence.
After all, membership in the EU and the eurozone has been the main force pushing Italy away from irresponsible short-termism and toward greater fiscal discipline.
Historically, Italians trusted the EU more than their own governments. But that may no longer be true, meaning that the risks of a harder push toward the exit are mounting.
Even if Italy remains in the eurozone, however, the ruling coalition is likely to behave much like its predecessors. The only novelty may be the extent of the damage it causes.

Invasion of the Culture Snatchers?
The specter of ``Americanization'' haunts the world.
Its consequences are demonized everywhere, sometimes going as far as to draw on the metaphor of a (need I say American) science-fiction movie entitled Invasion of the Body Snatchers, within which hostile aliens imperceptibly take control of our bodies and our minds.
But hyperbolic rhetoric about invasions misses the complexity of the cultural change taking place all around us.
Neither side in the debate about Americanization offers a convincing explanation for the phenomenon.
Those who argue that Americanization is a virulent form of ``cultural imperialism'' apparently see it as a product of growing market domination by American media concerns.
However, many giant cultural corporations - Japanese-owned Sony, Canadian-owned Seagram, Murdoch's empire or Germany's Bertelsmann - are no longer American, even though they promote American cultural models.
Even if the media were American-owned, it is too facile to say that consumers of culture the world over are mere clay in the hands of skilled marketing experts.
It makes more sense to assume that there are some elements of social, psychic, and aesthetic gratification that explain the resonance of American cultural models, and provide for their commercial usefulness.
The other side in the debate over Americanization emphasizes the liberating, anti-authoritarian power of American popular culture.
At times, this may be fitting: in 1950's Germany, for example, American youth culture had a strong anti-authoritarian component that helped to undermine authoritarianism and contributed to the process of postwar democratization.
Only rarely, however, does American-inspired popular culture possess this dimension explicitly.
More often, its attack on authority takes the form of willful provocations or ever-more uninhibited and graphic depictions of violence.
At other times, the refreshingly anti-authoritarian appeal of such programs as The Simpsons is commercially exploited to strengthen global media empires, such as Rupert Murdoch's.
In other words, anti-authoritarianism is not the whole story either.
We need to look with more nuance at the forward march of American culture instead of demonizing it as a form of crude imperialism or merely celebrating its liberating potential.
In particular, American popular culture must be viewed in light of the drawn-out historical process of cultural modernization.
In the past, culture was tied to privilege and wealth.
Until the 18 th century, books were comparatively expensive; their ownership was limited largely to the propertied classes.
Moreover, a certain educational grounding (such as knowledge of Latin or Greek) was necessary to make sense of most cultural objects.
``Popular culture'' is our word for a form of culture that gradually abolished these restrictions.
Its earliest manifestation, the novel, aided by new print technologies, created a market that allowed for much wider access to literature.
Knowledge of meter or classical poetics was no longer necessary.
The novel became the literature of the middle class, and the dime novel , an ``abbreviated novel'' for a dime and slimmed down to magazine-size, expanded readership to the lower strata of society, especially to adolescent readers.
The development of an ``entertainment culture'' around the turn of the 20 th century, including vaudeville theater, amusement parks, a dance craze triggered by the domestication of black plantation dances, and silent movies, further reduced the prerequisites for cultural understanding.
The invention of radio and television extended the audience for this new ``mass'' culture even more, and the shift to the priority of pictures and music created a ``universal'' language, not limited to a particular community.
For a number of reasons, America was in the forefront of this cultural revolution.
Due to its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural composition, especially in the formative years of modern entertainment culture around 1900, American popular culture was faced with the challenge of a market that anticipated the present global market on a smaller scale.
This led to the development of broadly comprehensible, non-verbal forms of performance, relying preferably on visual and auditory forms of expression.
Before Americanization of other societies could occur, American culture itself had to be ``Americanized.''
What is the meaning and cultural significance of this process of ``Americanization?''
The constant reduction of the prerequisites for making sense of culture may confirm the view that consumers of mass culture are passive.
Popular music, in particular, is highly effective in insinuating itself into the listener almost imperceptibly; no intellectual processing of its content is required because it makes no claim to inform.
Instead, moods are created by subliminal effect.
The characteristic form by which music activates the imagination is by short evocations of out-of-context images, or a diffuse feeling of boundlessness, both of which need not be integrated into any meaningful context.
Listeners to popular music need not ``earn'' their aesthetic experience through participation.
Contrary to prior visual forms of cultural expression, including the movies, there is no longer a need for continuity in the flow of images; contrary to what happens with a novel, no mental translation is required because the sensual effect of music creates associations that are shaped not by narrative but by mood.
The development of popular culture from the novel via the image to the triumph of popular music and the ``center-less'' heterogeneity of television, created forms of cultural expression that are singularly useful for the purposes of imaginary self-extension and self-empowerment.
The result is an increasing separation of expressive elements from moral, social, even narrative contexts.
Here is the triumph of ``mood over morals.''
Americanization, indeed, is carried by the promise of heightened imaginary self-realization for individuals who are freed from the bonds of social norms and cultural traditions.
Americanization, thus, cannot be viewed as a tacitly engineered hidden cultural takeover but as a process in which individualization is the driving force.
This process is most advanced in the US for a number of reasons.
The promise of a particular form of individualization provides the explanation why American popular culture finds so much resonance in other societies where it has taken hold almost without resistance (mostly carried by a young generation trying to escape tradition).
Cultural Americanization is thus part of a modernizing process.
Americanization is not a form of cultural imperialism, but the embodiment of modernity's promise of painless self-realization for each individual, in contrast to the demands made by more traditional concepts of emancipation.
Globalization, which often appears as the triumph of cultural standardization, in reality undermines standardization.
No single national culture is the driving force but, instead, globalization is powered by a restless individualism drawing on a growing store of mass symbols.
So: we are not becoming Americanized.
We ``Americanize'' ourselves.

Safety Nets in Troubled Times: Lessons from Indonesia’s Crisis

Japan’s Political Tremors
NEW YORK – Rarely – indeed, perhaps not since World War II – have the Japanese had such good press abroad.
Even South Korean newspapers have been full of praise for the self-discipline of ordinary Japanese in dire circumstances.
And coming from Koreans, not usually Japan’s biggest fans, that is no small thing.
When it comes to Japanese officials, however, matters are a little different.
There has been much complaining from foreign observers, aid teams, reporters, and government spokesmen about the lack of clarity, not to mention reliability, of official Japanese statements about the various disasters following the massive earthquake that struck northeastern Japan on March 11.
Serious problems appeared to be skirted, deliberately hidden, or played down.
Worse still, few people had any understanding of who was responsible for what.
Sometimes it looked very much as if the Japanese government itself was kept in the dark by officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), owners of the nuclear power plants that are leaking radiation into land, sea, and sky.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan had to ask TEPCO executives at one point, “What the hell is going on?”
If Kan didn’t know, how could anyone else?
Indeed, Japan’s powerful bureaucrats, normally assumed to know what they are doing, appeared to be as helpless as elected politicians.
Outside Japan, it is widely believed that everything works differently there, owing to the country’s exotic culture.
This perception is not entirely false.
An important aspect of culture is the use of language.
Often Japanese officials’ utterances are deliberately vague, to avoid having to take responsibility if things go wrong – a fairly universal trait among the powerful.
But some utterances may get lost in translation.
When a Japanese official says that he will take something “into serious consideration,” he means “no.”
This is not always properly understood.
In the case of Japan’s official response to the earthquake and tsunami-related disasters, however, cultural exoticism is not an adequate explanation.
In fact, the Japanese themselves have been as critical as any foreigner, if not more so, of their politicians’ apparent haplessness, and of TEPCO officials’ evasions and obfuscations.
Some people are even leaving the relative safety of Tokyo, having lost trust in the government and TEPCO, which has a history of covering up dangerous flaws in its nuclear facilities.
An investigation in 2002 revealed that TEPCO had submitted false data to the government, concealed accidents, and literally hid cracks.
The breakdown of public trust in Japanese officialdom would be worrying were it to lead to a democratic breakdown.
But it might also lead to necessary changes.
Even though systems of government may have certain traditional components, Japan’s problems are systemic, not cultural.
Japanese government was always paternalistic, and the chain of command complex and vague.
During the war, the emperor was omnipotent in theory, but relatively powerless in fact.
But there was never a dictator, either.
Decisions emerged from murky negotiations and hidden rivalries between bureaucrats, imperial courtiers, politicians, and military officials, often pushed this way or that by various domestic and foreign pressures, some of them violent.
The post-war political order, though no longer belligerent, was just as murky, with bureaucrats acting as the puppeteers of underfunded and ill-informed politicians, who operated regional pork-barrel operations together with big business, which in turn worked in cahoots with the bureaucrats.
So long as Japan was playing catch-up with the West, and government and industrial resources were concentrated on economic growth, the system worked quite well.
Indeed, it was the envy of many Westerners, who were fed up with self-interested lobbying, pesky labor unions, and meddling politicians.
Such Westerners are now often just as enamored of China’s paternalistic – and equally opaque and impenetrable – political system.
But it was this system that produced the problems now associated with TEPCO.
Tight-knit cliques of bureaucrats and corporate officials made sure that a utility company vital for economic growth would never be hindered by strict regulation or political oversight.
The cozy relationships between government officials and the corporate world – and not just in the case of TEPCO – was reflected in the large number of retired bureaucrats who took jobs on the boards of companies that they had supposedly regulated.
Many Japanese are aware of these problems, which is why they voted for Kan’s Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in 2009, breaking the virtual political monopoly exercised for a half-century by the conservative Liberal Democrats.
One of the DPJ government’s stated goals was to increase the political system’s transparency: less hidden authority for bureaucrats, more responsibility for elected politicians.
The aftermath of the earthquake is thus a potential watershed.
If Japan’s relatively inexperienced government is blamed for everything that goes wrong, people might wish to retreat to the old ways of murky paternalism.
If, on the other hand, enough people realize that the old ways are the problem, rather than the solution, democratic reforms will still have a fighting chance.
That would cast at least one ray of light on the gloom that envelops Japan today.

Brexit to Nowhere?
BERLIN – Politics brings out strong emotions in everyone.
Even the British, despite their reputation for pursuing their interests in a cool and calm fashion, apparently are not immune.
Perhaps that reputation is merely a holdover from the long-gone British Empire.
It surely does not apply to the United Kingdom of 2017.
Consider the political decisions Britons have made over the past year.
Last June, they decided – albeit narrowly – to withdraw from the European Union.
And in last month’s snap general election, they delivered an outcome that only reinforces the impression that British pragmatism is in retreat.
The election – in which the Conservative Party lost its majority, resulting in a hung parliament – suggests how far removed from the rest of the country the political class in Westminster has become.
Indeed, the UK appears to be undergoing not just a political and identity crisis, but also a crisis of confidence in its political and economic elites, which began with the 2008 global financial crisis.
This will not make the ongoing Brexit talks any easier.
The EU’s counterpart in the negotiation is a severely weakened government in a state of crisis.
But the EU’s negotiators cannot lose sight of the fact that the UK will still be important to Europe outside of the EU.
One of the biggest risks now, for the EU as much as for the UK, is that the latter will leave with nothing, and end up in an even worse state than it is already in.
Future historians will probably look back at 2016 and 2017 with great interest.
It is unprecedented for a country to abandon a highly advantageous geopolitical and economic position simply because it is experiencing a prolonged identity crisis.
Before Brexit got underway, the UK had a very strong hand to play within the EU, and thus on the world stage, owing not least to its special relationship with the United States.
Moreover, the UK has a tradition of liberalism and global engagement, especially with Europe and the eurozone.
London has long been a financial center for the entire continent.
And the British economy is – or, at least, was – a gateway for many international corporations seeking access to the EU single market and the eurozone, despite the UK’s refusal to join the single currency.
Still, it is worth remembering that by the early 1970s, the UK had lost its empire and the political clout that went with it; and that it only managed to reverse its economic decline by joining the European Community (the precursor to the EU) in 1973.
Regrettably, Britons rarely acknowledge this fact.
Instead, a vocal segment of Britain’s political class and electorate has long blamed the EU and its institutions – some of which require member states to cede part of their sovereignty – for all the evils of this world.
But now that the UK is withdrawing from the EU, it is becoming increasingly clear that it stands to lose a great deal, economically and politically.
And for what?
The UK’s Brexiteers demand “sovereignty,” but without considering what that could possibly mean in an era of ever-advancing globalization and market integration.
Given the Trump administration’s protectionist rhetoric, the importance of maintaining access to Europe’s single market would seem to be more acute than ever.
But the UK will not be the only loser from Brexit.
The EU will lose its second-largest economy and primary guarantor of security.
One hope now is that Emmanuel Macron’s election to the French presidency will blunt some of the pain from Brexit.
Macron’s election, along with positive economic news from the eurozone, represents an unexpected opportunity for a fresh start within the EU, which could begin as soon as Germany holds its general election in September.
As it happens, the UK might very well be leaving an EU that is quickly moving toward renewed political stability and economic growth – which is, ironically, what the Leave camp imagines that it can achieve with Brexit.
Fortunately, the UK’s recent election may have provided a starting point for negotiations.
To many observers, the outcome showed that British voters oppose a “hard Brexit,” whereby the UK would quit the single market and customs union with no deal in place, and revert to World Trade Organization rules.
Divorce proceedings are rarely pleasant.
But they are far worse when the parties involved do not behave like adults.
When emotions run free, former affections can quickly turn into spite and a desire to inflict deep wounds.
But for countries, as for people, life goes on after divorce.
The EU and the UK will remain geographically close, and thus geopolitically dependent on one another.
Ongoing issues relating to security, terrorism, and refugees will force both sides to work together; and trade will continue, even if it faces more hurdles.
It is thus in both sides’ interest not to inflict deep wounds, instigate confrontations, or embarrass and threaten the other side.
Above all, issues relating to common UK-EU security should not be part of the negotiations.
Both sides need to acknowledge their mutual dependence and be prepared to show generosity.
The EU, for its part, should be generous with respect to the timeframe for withdrawal, new trade regulations, and any transitional arrangements that could soften the impact of the separation.
And the UK should be mindful of the many EU citizens currently residing in Britain, and honest about its financial commitments to the bloc.
If there is one thing to keep in mind, it is that people change theirs.
And, because people’s sentiments change, countries change direction.
No possible future should be ruled out, including one in which both parties say, “Let’s try again.”

Human Nature and the Ethical Life
NEW YORK – Does human nature exist?
The answer has implications for anyone concerned about ethics.
In an era defined by amoral political leadership and eroding social values, thinking about the essence of humanity has never been more important.
The philosophical concept of “human nature” has a long history.
In Western culture, its study began with Socrates in the fifth century BCE, but it was Aristotle who argued that human nature was characterized by unique attributes – particularly, people’s need to socialize and our ability to reason.
For the Stoics of Hellenistic Greece, human nature was what gave life meaning and contributed to their embrace of cosmopolitanism and equality.
Ancient Chinese philosophers like Confucius and Mencius believed human nature was innately good, while Xunzi thought it was evil and lacked a moral compass.
In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions, human nature is fundamentally corrupted by sin, but can be redeemed by embracing God, in whose image we have been created.
Modern Western philosophers, writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, expanded on these ideas.
The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued that our natural state leads to a life that is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,” which is why we need a strong, centralized political authority (the so-called Leviathan).
By contrast, Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that human nature is malleable, but that our original state was one without reason, language, or community.
He concluded that the mismatch between our early condition and modern civilization is at the root of our unhappiness, advocating a literal return to nature.
David Hume, always sensible and moderate, proposed that humans are characterized by a combination of altruism and selfishness, and that such a combination can be partially molded for the better (or worse) by culture.
Charles Darwin’s work in the mid-1800s made many of the early “essentialist” views of human nature untenable.
The idea that humans had a small set of characteristics that only humans possess was at odds with the slow, gradual pace of Darwinian evolution.
While Homo sapiens evolved as a particular species of primate, there are no clean breaks between our biology and that of other species.
So the philosophical debate over human nature rages on, updated with the findings of biology.
Today, some philosophers interpret Rousseau and Darwin to mean that human nature itself is nonexistent, and that while biology may constrain the body, it does not restrict our minds or our volition.
Evolutionary psychologists and even some neuroscientists say that is nonsense.
The message they take from Darwin (and partly from Rousseau) is that we are maladaptive in a modern context – basically, Pleistocene apes who find themselves equipped with mobile phones and nuclear weapons.
As an evolutionary biologist and philosopher of science, my view is that human nature certainly exists, but that it is not based on an “essence” of any kind. Rather, our species, just like any other biological species, is characterized by a dynamic and evolving set of traits that are statistically typical for our lineage but neither present in every member nor absent from every other species.
Why does any of this matter to someone who is not a scientist or a philosopher?
There are at least two good reasons that I can think of.
One is personal; the other is political.
First, how we interpret human nature has broad implications for ethics, in the ancient Greco-Roman sense of the study of how we should live our lives.
Someone who holds a Judeo-Christian-Islamic view of human nature is naturally going to worship God and follow the guidance of religious commandments.
By contrast, someone adopting an existentialist philosophy along the lines of Jean-Paul Sartre or Simone de Beauvoir might believe that because “existence precedes essence,” we are radically free to shape our lives according to our own choices, and do not need God to help us along.
Moreover, views on human nature affect views on ethics.
And today, our ethics are a mess.
One recent study in the United States called Donald Trump’s presidency the “most unethical” in American history, while Gallup’s annual survey of US attitudes toward morality suggests a steady erosion of social mores.
If we all took a moment to consider where we stood on the debate about human nature, we might gain valuable insight into our own beliefs – and by extension, the beliefs of others.
Personally, I lean toward the naturalistic ethics of the Stoics, for whom human nature constrains and suggests – but does not rigidly determine – what we can and should do.
But regardless of one’s religious or philosophical leanings, reflecting on who we are – biologically and otherwise – is a good way to take more ownership of our actions. Needless to say, there are many among us who could benefit from such an exercise.

How to Reset the US Pandemic Response
NEW YORK – It’s easy to find fault with the United States’ COVID-19 response or, to be more accurate, the woeful lack thereof.
Denial, delays, political infighting, and systemic failures have resulted in more than 100,000 US deaths and deepened the social and economic crisis.
Over 40 million workers – one in four – have filed for unemployment benefits since March.
Now, Americans are being told that the country, though unprepared, should rush back to “normalcy.”
What has gone awry in the US response transcends today’s hyper-partisan politics.
The roots of this American disaster run deep.
To be clear, much of the blame is deservedly partisan, with only the Democrats attempting – over Republican opposition – to patch up the threadbare US safety net via direct support for the unemployed, the poor, the already sick, and the otherwise vulnerable.
But Democrats, too, have stopped short of calling for the US government to direct – and pay – the private sector to produce the goods and services that are socially required but that the market on its own cannot and will not deliver.
Saying that the state must be called on to “deliver the goods” evokes images of Soviet-style central planners deciding which style, shape, and even size of shoes should be produced.
The state clearly has no business interfering in such a way in the market for private goods.
Doing so only leads to the artificial shortages reminiscent of command economies.
But in capitalist economies, too, governments play a direct role in providing certain goods.
Public goods – national defense, for example – clearly ought to be provided by government.
In fact, in the US, it is not the public sector itself that produces defense goods; the government directs the private sector to do so.
Use of the US Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950, modeled after the War Powers Acts that gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt massive authority to direct the US economy during World War II, is not exactly rare.
The military places around 300,000 orders each year under DPA, a practice that has continued under President Donald Trump.
But the Trump administration has been reluctant to rely on DPA for COVID-19 relief.
It was used only in select cases, for example when directing 3M to prioritize US government orders for N95 face masks and barring the company from exporting them, or when directing General Motors to manufacture ventilators.
The Trump administration deployed DPA in a way that was at once too interventionist and not interventionist enough.
It relied on what one might call hard command-and-control provisions and used DPA “against” 3M and GM.
The government told the private sector what to do.
A much better use of the state’s vast powers would be soft command: government creates incentives for the private sector to produce goods that benefit society.
Germany, for example, used government purchase guarantees as part of a much broader support package.
The goal was clear: not to command German companies to produce medical equipment, but to set the right incentives for them to do so.
None of this is to diminish organic corporate innovation and entrepreneurial ingenuity.
We should all applaud the local distillery shifting its production from spirits to hand sanitizer, or the maker of coffee filters that switches to producing facemasks.
But it is clear that the market, left to its own devices, does not produce a sufficient quantity of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and therapeutic drugs.
Nor, if and when the time comes, will it ensure universal vaccination.
The US government is at no disadvantage, relative to Germany.
Under Title III of the DPA, it has the same tool at its disposal: federal purchase guarantees.
Reluctance to use this authority reflects a dangerous ideological confusion.
Facemasks, ventilators, and vaccinations are neither private nor public goods.
They are not like shoes: one’s personal preference for oversized purple pumps might offend others’ fashion sensibilities but otherwise produces no externalities, negative or positive.
And they are not like air, a non-rival and non-excludable public good.
Facemasks, ventilators, and vaccinations are social goods: their provision benefits society, and government must not hesitate to ensure adequate supplies.
More often than not, provision of social goods requires strong government incentives to encourage the private sector to supply them.
The COVID-19 response is not the only case of this.
The same is true of technologies to mitigate or adapt to climate change, another systemic problem that the private sector, on its own, will not address in the interest of all.
Whether the problem is COVID-19 or climate change, corporate volunteerism and philanthropy cannot solve it.
To benefit from the full might of America’s famed private-sector dynamism will require marshaling the power of the federal government to repurpose private capital and energy in support of a massive social undertaking.
So far, the US federal government’s response has been a series of missed opportunities, beginning with the failure to prepare adequately either to detect and contain the pandemic, or to address the economic fallout.
It extends to the first $2 trillion relief bill, which failed to use any of the money to create the right incentives for mobilizing private-sector forces to address the root cause of the economic collapse.
After all, there could be no better economic stimulus than beating COVID-19.
Achieving that outcome, like addressing climate change, requires rethinking the role of government.
A Soviet-style command economy does not work in the best of times.
But, as the COVID-19 crisis should make clear, a US-style capitalist economy is inadequate to the challenge of providing the social goods people need.
Securing them requires an active state that takes the private sector seriously.

What’s the Matter With Germany?
ROME – Italy may be the “sick man of Europe” today, but it is not the only country in need of medicine.
On the contrary, even the mighty Germany seems to be coming down with something.
Italy is, to be sure, in dire straits.
Over the last two decades, annual GDP growth has averaged just 0.46%, and government debt has risen steadily, totaling more than 130% of GDP today.
Unemployment has remained persistently high, investment is plummeting, and the banking sector is deeply troubled.
Equally concerning, the number of women of child-bearing age has fallen by nearly two million since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
And the share of active workers with a university education remains at levels barely comparable with other advanced economies.
Given all of this, it should come as no shock that Italy and crisis-plagued Greece are the eurozone’s weakest performers in terms of per capita GDP growth over the last three years.
What is surprising is that Germany is the third-weakest performer.
Germany is fiscally sound, with a large accumulation of surplus savings.
It is also highly competitive in unit-labor-cost terms, enjoys its highest-ever labor participation rates, and benefits from a steady inflow of skilled labor from other parts of Europe.
But the fact is that Germany’s average annual per capita GDP growth of 0.51% since 2014 puts it far behind other core eurozone countries – namely, Austria, Belgium, Finland, and the Netherlands.
Even France, where per capita growth barely exceeds that of Italy, slightly outperforms Germany.
How is it possible that economies as different as Germany and Italy have such similar per capita growth performance?
To some extent, the explanation might seem obvious.
Germany is much closer to potential growth than Italy and even the United States, which struggled more than Germany to escape the Great Recession.
But the more recent recovery in other advanced countries should, if anything, have boosted potential growth in export-driven Germany.
Likewise, migration could affect per capita GDP growth.
Germany has received 2.7 million new residents, net of outflows, over the last five years, nearly a million of whom are refugees.
The latter provide an obvious Keynesian boost, but don’t add much to potential output.
Yet the migrant flows into Germany are not exactly anomalous.
The country had experienced similarly strong net inflows at other times in the last three decades, without such adverse effects on per capita GDP growth.
On the contrary, in many cases, migrants into Germany, particularly the young and skilled among them, have contributed to potential output.
The real culprit behind Germany’s low per capita GDP growth must be sought elsewhere.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, German banks’ claims on other eurozone countries – including Austria, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain – have fallen by over $200 billion, in aggregate, since the peak of the debt crisis in mid-2012.
Claims on Italy are down to pre-euro levels, and claims on Spain are nearing that benchmark.
Germany has even been disinvesting from core eurozone economies.
German banks’ quiet move toward disintegration contrasts sharply with the behavior of banks based in France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, all of which have resumed European financial integration by stabilizing and often increasing their exposure in other countries.
These divergent trends, rather than generic capital flight, explain part of the growing imbalances in the Target 2 eurozone payment system.
Why are German banks the only ones backtracking on integration?
One possible reason is that domestic financial authorities, skeptical about the euro’s future, have instructed banks to cut their exposure to the rest of the eurozone.
Another is that German banks are experiencing a slow-burn malaise that European regulators have yet to recognize fully.
Their cost-base is, after all, the highest in the advanced world, yet their profitability is among the lowest, despite their negligible burden of bad loans.
Nonetheless, such skittishness is puzzling.
Around half of the German banking system is publicly owned, and thus enjoys an implicit government guarantee.
In fact, German banks received €239 billion ($253 billion) in state aid between 2009 and 2015.
In any case, German banks’ withdrawal from Europe cannot possibly be good for confidence, investment, or a dynamic service sector.
And, indeed, investment in Germany last year was more than five percentage points below its 1999 levels as a share of GDP, even though gross national savings have climbed to the highest levels since the International Monetary Fund data series began in 1980.
German officials usually explain away this huge drop by citing the parsimony of an aging society.
But demographic challenges – which are tomorrow’s constraints on potential output – should inspire reforms in entitlements and education, not suppression of today’s demand.
And that is where the real issue lies: no EU country, with the possible exception of France, has implemented so few reforms over the last decade as Germany.
That lack of reform is starting to show.
Wary banks and low investment must have played a role since 2012 in what looks like Germany’s slowest stretch of growth in total factor productivity in three decades.
Relying largely on exports – that is, other countries’ demand – may have distracted the German government from some of its own domestic responsibilities.
But it is in the interest of all of Europe – and Italy, in particular – that the continent’s largest economy become even stronger.
To be sure, the productivity slowdown is far from unique to Germany.
But unless Germany addresses the roots of that slowdown at home, it risks taking a huge hit, in the event that its currency is sharply revalued, in the form of lower exports and damage to its already-weak banking sector, resulting from deflation and negative long-term interest rates.
Italy’s illness is far more acute than Germany’s, but both are potentially serious.
Both are in need of immediate treatment.

The Terrorist Next Door
NEW DELHI – Recent incidents on the Line of Control (LoC) – the frontier between India and Pakistan in the state of Jammu and Kashmir – have again raised fundamental questions about the nuclear-armed neighbors’ fraught relationship.
Early this month, India’s army foiled an attempted incursion by a group of 30 to 40 militants from Pakistani territory, leading Indian critics to decry official peace overtures.
Indeed, barely two weeks before the latest incident, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, during the United Nations General Assembly session in New York.
Pakistan was hacked off the stooped shoulders of India by the departing British in 1947 as a homeland for India’s Muslims; but, until recently (as Pakistan’s population continues to grow at a higher rate than India’s), more Muslims remained in India than lived in Pakistan.
Bilateral relations have been bedeviled ever since by a festering dispute over the divided territory of Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state (but home to only 3% of India’s Muslims, who are scattered in larger numbers throughout the country).
For decades, open conflict and simmering hostility have been punctuated by periods of short-lived bonhomie.
The principal obstacle to peace has been Pakistan’s sponsorship of militancy and terrorism within India, culminating in the horrific attacks in Mumbai in November 2008, in which terrorist commandos killed almost 200 people.
In the late 1980’s, Pakistan backed an insurrection by some Kashmiri Muslims and supplied arms, training, and funds to militants who infiltrated across the LoC.
The insurrection, which continues to this day, and Indian security forces’ response to it have caused great loss of life and property, and have all but wrecked the state’s economy, which is largely dependent on tourism.
In the process, both countries have suffered grievously.
Indian citizens have been killed in large numbers, while the government has had to deploy more than a half-million soldiers to keep the peace.
And Pakistan’s strategy of “bleeding India to death by a thousand cuts” through insurgency and terrorism has accomplished little, while making its military an enormously powerful domestic player and spawning terror outfits (some of which have turned against their sponsors).
In June, when Sharif became the first prime minister in Pakistan’s checkered political history to succeed a democratically elected prime minister through another democratic election, there was hope in India that the balance of power might shift from the military to the civilian government.
During his election campaign, and after his victory, Sharif expressed a determination to make peace with India.
Despite the historical pattern of Pakistani civilian leaders talking peace while armed men slip across the border, many in India believe that this time might be different.
But many also remain skeptical.
Singh sat down with Sharif after a series of incidents on the LoC led his critics to urge him not to proceed with the meeting.
India, the government’s critics argue, has taken upon itself the enormous burden of talking peace with a government that, when it comes to addressing the real threats emanating from its territory and institutions, has proved to be ineffective at best and duplicitous at worst.
The latest attempted infiltration – which Indian military leaders say could not have occurred without the Pakistani army’s complicity – has added to the outcry against the government for its alleged naiveté.
In pursuing peace with Pakistan, India’s government is indeed rolling the dice.
As the Mumbai attack five years ago and the recent LoC incidents have shown, the gap between Pakistan’s official statements and its military’s actions suggests that the civilian government, even if sincere, is too weak to control its own security apparatus.
So long as Pakistan’s government remains either unable or unwilling to push back against the so-called “non-state actors” that are said to be out of its control, why should India pursue the dialogue that it called off in 2008?
Yet India’s peaceniks are not wrong.
A country that seeks to focus on its own enormous development challenges should do everything it can to defuse hostility on its borders.
Not talking to Pakistan is not much of a policy; it has been tried for years, yielding no significant benefit.
If India’s pursuit of peace strengthens like-minded Pakistani politicians who are struggling against their own hawks, it is worth attempting.
The benefits of peace, for both sides, would be enormous.
But it has always been India, a status quo power, that wishes to live in peace, while Pakistan, craving Kashmir, uses every means at its disposal to alter the status quo.
For this reason, India’s army must be well prepared and vigilant in defense of the country’s borders.
But, unlike in Pakistan, the army in India does not make foreign policy.
That is the prerogative of an elected civilian government that is determined to engage in dialogue with its eyes open (and its weapons at the ready).
It would help if Pakistan’s government – facing home-grown terrorists even as it exports terror to its neighbors – showed a little more willingness to join the quest for peace.
The moment the Pakistani establishment genuinely disavows terrorism as an instrument of state policy, the prospect of peace will dawn on the subcontinent.
Alas, that prospect is not yet even a glimmer on the horizon.

The New Face of the United Nations
On January 1, 2007, Ban Ki-Moon, South Korea’s former foreign minister, will become United Nations Secretary-General, following Kofi Annan’s ten-year tenure.
Annan inspired the world with his diplomacy and leadership on poverty reduction and human rights, but the war in Iraq divided the world and drew attention and financial resources away from crisis regions and critical long-term problems like climate change, disease control, sustainable energy, and access to water.
With the recent elections in the United States and the rise of Asia’s global influence, there is an opportunity to turn the world’s attention to the most critical challenges facing our planet.
In addition to the long-term challenges of poverty, the environment, nuclear proliferation, and UN reform, the new Secretary-General will inherit a long list of hotspots: Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Palestine, Lebanon, Somalia, Myanmar, Sudan, North Korea, and others.
Recent attempts to influence developments in these countries through threats and sanctions, and sometimes war, have failed.
Most are less stable today than they were five years ago.
Clearly, a new approach is needed.
The leading Asian countries, including Ban’s South Korea, have long favored a balance of diplomatic approaches and economic incentives as the way to solve complex challenges.
Rather than relying on sanctions and threats of force, the idea is to underpin long-term prosperity in today’s unstable regions.
This balanced approach is important because most of the world’s hotspots are in trouble not only, or even mainly, because of politics, but because of the underlying challenges of hunger, disease, and environmental crisis.
Consider Darfur, a crisis that has been debated in the UN Security Council as a confrontation between the Sudanese Government and the people of Darfur.
But the deeper truth is that Darfur is unstable because it is home to an impoverished and fast-growing population without adequate supplies of water, food, health clinics, schools, and other basic services.
Rather than focusing on sanctions, the major powers would do much better to work with Sudan’s government to propose and help to finance long-term development strategies.
Defusing the crises in Darfur and elsewhere will be among the greatest challenges facing the new Secretary-General.
Yet it is vital that the UN not simply lurch from one hotspot to the next.
The UN also has the unique role and opportunity to offer leadership in building a global consensus around vital long-term environmental and economic challenges facing the planet.
Climate change, deforestation, growing populations, and other ecological strains will challenge the very survival of hundreds of millions of people around the world in the coming decades. UN leadership will be instrumental to proposing and forging solutions to such daunting long-term global challenges.
In fact, from 1992 to 2002, the UN’s member governments signed a number of treaties and agreements that can and should provide the foundation for long-term global solutions.
Three treaties emerged in 1992 out of the so-called Rio Conference on the Environment – on climate change, biodiversity conservation, and desertification.
In 2000, the member governments agreed on the Millennium Development Goals.
And in 2002, they agreed on the Monterrey Consensus, pledging concrete efforts to triple aid flows to the poorest in order to reach the international goal for foreign assistance of 0.7% of rich-world GNP.
The key for today’s UN, therefore, is not to create more goals, but to implement those that have been set.
This, too, fits strongly with the spirit in which Ban has approached his new position.
He has made clear his intention that the UN should implement the commitments that the world community has made.
Without implementation, all of the treaties in the world would lead us nowhere.
During his mandate, the Secretary-General will face the pressing challenge of forging a global agreement on climate change for the years beyond 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol ends.
The Millennium Development Goals remain far off track in the poorest countries, with just nine years to go.
Despite a global pledge to reduce significantly the loss of biological diversity by 2010, huge areas of rainforest and oceans continue to be destroyed.
If the United States works more closely within the UN framework, it will find willing partners in the rising Asian powers, which are intent on using their influence and resources to solve today’s challenges.
After all, Asian countries are interested in global stability to underpin their own long-term development.
They are acutely aware of their increasing influence around the world, as investors, trading partners, and as contributors to and victims of environmental change.
Behind the scenes, the Asian powers can help to defuse the crises in Darfur, North Korea, Myanmar, and elsewhere.
And they will be crucial to forging new cooperative approaches to climate change, water scarcity, and the like.
The new Secretary-General comes to office with the world yearning to solve festering problems.
Importantly, there is already broad agreement on a set of shared goals. Those goals are achievable.
The challenge is implementation.

The Fall of the Berlin Wall and Social Democracy
CAMBRIDGE – It was already clear 30 years ago that the fall of the Berlin Wall would change everything.
But precisely what that change will mean for world politics in the twenty-first century still remains to be seen.
By 1989, the Soviet Union, and communism generally, had condemned tens of millions of people to poverty, and had clearly failed to compete with the Western economic model.
Over four decades, the Cold War had taken millions of lives in various theaters around the world (where the conflict was much hotter than its name suggests), and created a pretext for repression and elite dominance in dozens of countries across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
Yet for all its positive implications, the post-Cold War era also upended the Western social-democratic compact: the system of safety nets, regulations, universal public services, redistributive tax policies, and labor-market institutions that had long protected workers and the less fortunate.
According to the political scientist Ralf Dahrendorf (as quoted by the late Tony Judt), that policy consensus had signified “the greatest progress which history has seen so far.”
Not only had it limited and then reduced inequality in most advanced economies; it also contributed to decades of sustained growth.
The economic growth of the post-war era was born of broadly competitive markets, which had been created through regulations to break the backs of monopolies and powerful conglomerates.
It also depended on a generously supported system of public education and government-funded innovation.
The proliferation of high-paying good jobs during this period was the result of labor-market institutions that prevented employers from wielding excessive powers over their employees; without such constraints, firms would have generated low-wage jobs with harsh working conditions.
Social democracy played an equally important role in politics.
Its redistributive institutions and welfare-state programs could not have survived without non-elites wielding political power.
Broad-based political participation was achieved through reforms to expand the franchise and deepen democratic processes.
It was supported by powerful political parties, such as the Swedish Workers’ Party, and trade unions.
And it was driven by universalist ideas that motivated people to support and defend democracy.
In many ways, the United States was no different from its Western European counterparts.
Throughout the New Deal and post-war eras, it enthusiastically busted trusts and reined in the political influence of the wealthy.
It instituted government-administered old-age and disability pensions (Social Security), unemployment benefits, and redistributive taxation, and adopted various anti-poverty measures.
While deploying anti-socialist language, it nonetheless adopted social democracy with American characteristics – which meant, among other things, that its social safety net was weaker than in other countries.
None of this can be understood in the absence of communism.
After all, social-democratic movements emerged from communist parties, many of which – including the Social Democrats in post-war Germany and the French Socialist Party – did not abandon socialist rhetoric until well into the 1960s, or even the 1980s.
While the parties that proved most successful in creating new labor-market institutions, securing high-quality public services, and reaching a broad social consensus, such as the Swedish Workers’ Party or the British Labour Party, had typically repudiated their earlier Marxism, they still spoke the same language as their Marxist cousins.
More to the point, elites themselves embraced the social-democratic compact as a means of preventing communist revolution.
It was this anti-communist mode of social democracy that motivated intellectuals such as the economist John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the post-war order, and political leaders from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in the US.
Similarly, the threat of communism (from North Korea) drove South Korean leaders to pursue ambitious land reforms and investments in education, while tolerating some degree of union activity despite their desire to keep wages low.
But when communism collapsed – both as an economic system and as an ideology – it knocked the legs out from under the social-democratic stool.
Suddenly faced with the need to invent a new, equally inclusive, equally universalist ideology, the left proved unequal to the task.
And at the same time, the leaders of an already ascendant right interpreted the collapse of communism as a signal (and an opportunity) to roll back social democracy in favor of the market.
Yet, for a number of reasons, the embrace of this agenda in much of the West was mistaken.
For starters, it ignored the contribution that the welfare state, labor-market institutions, and government investments in research and development had made to post-war growth.
Second, it failed to anticipate that dismantling social-democratic institutions would weaken democracy itself, by further empowering incumbent politicians and the wealthy (who would become much wealthier in the process).
And, third, it ignored the lessons of the interwar years, when the absence of broad-based economic opportunities and strong safety nets had created the conditions for the rise of left- and right-wing extremism.
US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may have envisioned a world with more efficient markets and less bureaucratic controls.
But the political revolution they launched has culminated in the presidency of Donald Trump in the US and a Boris Johnson-led government in the United Kingdom.
The social-democratic compact now needs to be refashioned for the twenty-first century.
To that end, we need to recognize the problems facing advanced economies, from uncontrolled deregulation and finance run amok to the structural changes brought about by globalization and automation.
We also need to form a new political coalition that is broad enough to include industrial workers, who remain among the most politically active segments of the population, even as their numbers have fallen.
But, most important, we must recognize that curtailing the power of big companies; providing universal public services, including health care and high-quality education; protecting workers and preventing the rise of low-wage, precarious employment; and investing in R&D are not just policies that should be evaluated in terms of their economic consequences.
They are the essence of the social-democratic project, and the foundation of a prosperous and stable society.

Europe's Destabilizing Stability Pact
Europe's Growth and Stability Pact is under threat as never before.
Even European Commission President Romano Prodi now calls it "stupid."
In many ways, he may not be wrong.
Last summer, as soon as it became clear that Germany's mounting budget deficit might exceed the Stability Pact's ceiling, Chancellor Schröeder postponed a tax cut he had already announced rather than cut public spending.
The French government, unwilling to cut its swollen public sector, is now thumbing its nose at the Stability Pact and its enforcers in the European Commission, saying that it has "different priorities" than those required by the pact.
The question now is whether or not the Stability Pact can long survive the antagonism of the EU's two biggest economies.
The Stability Pact emerged after a long period (part of the 1970s, all of the 1980s, and a good portion of the 1990s) during which many European countries lost control of their fiscal balances.
The Stability Pact initially sought to force countries that wished to join European Monetary Union to bring their budgets closer into balance and to slash excess debt.
Now, however, its built-in flaws are being revealed.
The biggest problem concerns the fact that the Stability Pact focuses on a country's budget deficit, rather than on the component parts of government budgets: taxes and public spending.
Europe's fiscal problems have their roots in governments that are too big and that require, in order to pay for their bloated size, levels of taxation which grossly interfere with the incentives individuals need to work harder, invest more, and run entrepreneurial risks.
Setting a limit on a country's overall budget deficit - as the Stability Pact does - cannot correct this distortion.
Between 1995 and 2002, notwithstanding the Stability Pact, total public spending in the euro area (net of interest and of capital spending) remained virtually unchanged: it amounted to 41% of the euro zone's GDP in 1995; it will amount to 40.7% of GDP this year.
Meanwhile, gross government investment, already minuscule, contracted even further: from 2.7% to 2.4% of GDP.
As a result of the Stability Pact, teeny differences in budget outcomes acquire a prominence in Europe's economic policy debate that is not only ridiculous on their face, but distract attention from Europe's real budgetary problems.
Few people seem aware of the margin of error that exists when computing such numbers.
It is not uncommon, say, for parliamentary discussions about a budget to turn on the question of whether or not such an such an action will lead to a deficit of 0.8 or 1.1% of GDP-blithely unconcerned that the difference between those numbers is well below the statistical margin of error.
Futile debates of this type are a handy excuse for a country to avoid facing its real fiscal challenges: unsustainable pensions, unemployment benefits that discourage workers from looking for a new job, public sector wage bills unrelated to productivity.
In addition to shifting Europe's focus from its real budget challenges, the Stability Pact is indiscriminate - ie, it treats both high and low-debt countries in the same way.
Greece and Italy, whose total public debt exceeds 100% of annual GDP are treated in the same manner as Portugal, where the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 45%.
Such equivalence neglects the reason why the Stability Pact was created in the first place - to compel the most heavily indebted governments to put their fiscal house in order.
The third destabilizing factor built into the Stability Pact is the fact that it virtually invites governments to engage in creative, Enron-style accounting - ie, it encourages governments to cheat.
Changing the composition of the public debt, for instance issuing consols rather than bonds that pay a coupon, is often sufficient to lower the official deficit by a few decimal points, and this is only one in a finance minister's large black bag of tricks.
Europe desperately needs lower spending, especially on pensions and wages, and lower taxes.
Clearly, the Stability Pact cannot deliver the incentives needed to achieve these goals.
In fact, it may interfere with the one realistic way to reduce the size of government: cut taxes first, get European taxpayers accustomed to a lower burden, then create political incentives to reduce spending.
By remaining obsessed about the first decimal point of a deficit, even in a time of prolonged stagnation, Ecofin (the Council of European finance ministers) misses both the point of its mission, restraining the most profligate of government debtors, and the big picture about bringing growth to Europe.
In the end, if a European country, especially one of the EU's big four of Germany, France, Italy and the UK, wants to run a deficit that exceeds the strictures of the Stability Pact, it will do so with impunity, as France is doing now.
Two years into the euro's life, the Stability Pact that underpins the currency serves only the purpose of beating up on small countries (remember what happened to Ireland, which has as virtuous a budget balance as any country in Europe but which dared lower taxes against the Stability Pact's rules?).
It is time for a change in how the European Commission thinks, for less of an obsession with deficits and more attention to government spending.

The Dismal Economist’s Joyless Triumph
NEW YORK – I have long been forecasting that it was only a matter of time before America’s housing bubble – which began in the early days of this decade, supported by a flood of liquidity and lax regulation – would pop.
The longer the bubble expanded, the larger the explosion and the greater (and more global) the resulting downturn would be.ampnbsp;
Economists are good at identifying underlying forces, but they are not so good at timing.
The dynamics are, however, much as anticipated.
America is still on a downward trajectory for 2009 – with grave consequences for the world as a whole.
For example, as their tax revenues plummet, state and local governments are in the process of cutting back their expenditures.
American exports are about to decline.
Consumer spending is plummeting, as expected.
There has been an enormous decrease in (perceived) wealth, in the trillions, with the decline in house and stock prices.
Besides, most Americans were living beyond their means, using their houses, with their bloated values, as collateral.
That game is up.ampnbsp;
America would be facing these problems even if it were not simultaneously facing a financial crisis.
America’s economy had been supercharged by excessive leveraging; now comes the painful process of deleveraging.
Excessive leveraging, combined with bad lending and risky derivatives, has caused credit markets to freeze.
After all, when banks don’t know their own balance sheets, they aren’t about to trust others’.ampnbsp;
The Bush administration didn’t see the problems coming, denied that they were problems when they came, then minimized their significance, and, finally, panicked.
Guided by one of the architects of the problem, Hank Paulson, who had advocated for deregulation and allowing banks to take on even more leveraging, it was no surprise that the administration veered from one policy to another – each strategy supported with absolute conviction, until minutes before it was abandoned for another.
Even if confidence really were all that mattered, the economy would have sunk.
Moreover, what little action has been taken has been aimed at shoring up the financial system.
But the financial crisis is only one of several crises facing the country: the underlying macroeconomic problem has been made worse by the sinking fortunes of the bottom half of the population.
Those who would spend don’t have the money, and those with the money aren’t spending.
America, and the world, is also facing a major structural problem, not unlike that at the beginning of the last century, when productivity increases in agriculture meant that a rapidly declining share of the population could find work there.
Nowadays, increases in manufacturing productivity are even more impressive than they were for agriculture a century ago; but that means the adjustments that must be made are all the greater.
Not long ago, there was discussion of the dangers of a disorderly unwinding of the global economy’s massive imbalances.
What we are seeing today is part of that unwinding.
But there are equally fundamental changes in the global balances of economic power: the hoards of liquid money to help bail out the world lie in Asia and the Middle East, not in West. But global institutions do not reflect these new realities.
Globalization has meant that we are increasingly interdependent.
One cannot have a deep and long downturn in the world’s largest economy without global ramifications.
I had long argued that the notion of decoupling was a myth; the evidence now corroborates that view. This is especially so because America has exported not just its recession, but its failed deregulatory philosophy and toxic mortgages, so financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere are also confronting many of the same problems.ampnbsp;
Many in the developing world have benefited greatly from the last boom, through financial flows, exports, and high commodity prices.
Now, all of that is being reversed.
Indeed, it is the ultimate irony that money is now flowing from poor and well-managed economies to the US, the source of the global problems.
The point of reciting these challenges facing the world is to suggest that, even if Obama and other world leaders do everything right, the US and the global economy are in for a difficult period.
The question is not only how long the recession will last, but what the economy will look like when it emerges.
Will it return to robust growth, or will we have an anemic recovery, à la Japan in the 1990’s?
Right now, I cast my vote for the latter, especially since the huge debt legacy is likely to dampen enthusiasm for the big stimulus that is required.
Without a sufficiently large stimulus (in excess of 2% of GDP), we will have a vicious negative spiral: a weak economy will mean more bankruptcies, which will push stock prices down and interest rates up, undermine consumer confidence, and weaken banks.
Consumption and investment will be cut back further.
Many Wall Street financiers, having received their gobs of cash, are returning to their fiscal religion of low deficits.
It is remarkable how, having proven their incompetence, they are still revered in some quarters.
What matters more than deficits is what we do with money; borrowing to finance high-productivity investments in education, technology, or infrastructure strengthens a nation’s balance sheet.
The financiers, however, will argue for caution: let’s see how the economy does, and if it needs more money, we can give it.
But a firm that is forced into bankruptcy is not un-bankrupted when a course is reversed.
The damage is long-lasting.ampnbsp;
If Obama follows his instinct, pays attention to Main Street rather than Wall Street, and acts boldly, then there is a prospect that the economy will start to emerge from the downturn by late 2009.
If not, the short-term prospects for America, and the world, are bleak.

Blaming the Fed
FRANKFURT – Critics of the US Federal Reserve are having a field day with embarrassing revelations of its risk assessments on the eve of the financial crisis.
By law, the Fed is required to publish the transcripts of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings with a five-year lag.
While the full-blown crisis did not erupt until the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it was clear by the summer of 2007 that something was very wrong in credit markets, which were starting to behave in all sorts of strange ways.
Yet many Fed officials clearly failed to recognize the significance of what was unfolding.
One governor opined that the Fed should regard it as a good thing that markets were starting to worry about subprime mortgages.
Another argued that the summertime market stress would most likely be a hiccup.
Various critics are seizing on such statements as evidence that the Fed is incompetent, and that its independence should be curtailed, or worse.
This is nonsense.
Yes, things could and should have been done better; but to single out Fed governors for missing the coming catastrophe is ludicrous.
The Fed was hardly alone.
In August 2007, few market participants, even those with access to mountains of information and a broad range of expert opinions, had a real clue as to what was going on.
Certainly the US Congress was clueless; its members were still busy lobbying for the government-backed housing-mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thereby digging the hole deeper.
Nor did the International Monetary Fund have a shining moment.
In April 2007, the IMF released its famous “Valentine’s Day” World Economic Outlook, in which it declared that all of the problems in the United States and other advanced economies that it had been worrying about were overblown.
Moreover, it is misleading to single out the most misguided comments by individual governors in the context of an active intellectual debate over policy.
It is legitimate to criticize individual policymakers who exercised poor judgment, and they should have a mark on their record.
But that does not impugn the whole FOMC, much less the entire institution.
Central banks’ state-of-the-art macroeconomic models also failed miserably – to a degree that the economics profession has only now begun to acknowledge fully.
Although the Fed assesses many approaches and indicators in making its decisions, there is no doubt that it was heavily influenced by mainstream academic thinking – including the so-called real business cycle models and New Keynesian models – which assumed that financial markets operate flawlessly.
Indeed, the economics profession and the world’s major central banks advertised the idea of the “great moderation” – the muting of macroeconomic volatility, owing partly to monetary authorities’ supposedly more scientific, model-based approach to policymaking.
We now know that canonical macroeconomic models do not adequately allow for financial-market fragilities, and that fixing the models while retaining their tractability is a formidable task.
Frankly, had the models at least allowed for the possibility of credit-market imperfections, the Fed might have paid more attention to credit-market indicators as a reflection of overall financial-market conditions, as central banks in emerging-market countries do.
Last but not least, even if the Fed had better understood the risks, it would not have been easy for it to avert the crisis on its own.
The effectiveness of interest-rate policy is limited, and many of the deepest problems were on the regulatory side.
And calibrating a response was not easy.
By late 2007, for example, the Fed and the US Treasury had most likely already seen at least one report arguing that only massive intervention to support subprime loans could forestall a catastrophe.
The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices – which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse – that it had constructed.
Such a bailout would have cost an estimated $500 billion or more, and the main beneficiaries would have included big financial firms.
Was there any realistic chance that such a measure would have passed Congress before there was blood in the streets?
Indeed, it was precisely this logic that me led to give a very dark forecast in a widely covered speech in Singapore on August 19, 2008, a month before Lehman Brothers failed.
I argued that things would not get better until they got much worse, and that the collapse of one of the world’s largest financial firms was imminent.
My argument rested on my view that the global economy was entering a major recession, and I had the benefit of my quantitative work, with Carmen Reinhart, on the history of financial crises.
I was not trying to be sensational in Singapore.
I thought that what I was saying was completely obvious.
Nevertheless, my prediction gained bold front-page headlines in many major newspapers throughout the world.
It gained headlines, evidently, because it was still far from a consensus view, although concerns were mounting.
Were concerns mounting at the Fed as well in the summer of 2008?
We will have to wait until next year to find out.
But, when we do, let us remember that hindsight is 20-20.

Electrifying African Transport
CAIRO – Many transport experts think that we are succeeding in decarbonizing the sector: electric vehicles are taking off, public transport use is increasing, and cities worldwide are promoting cycling. But this sense of success is illusory.
Globally, transport-related greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions are increasing faster than ever, despite technological advances and investments in decarbonization. This is especially so in Africa.
Transport investments will be crucial in determining whether Africa heads toward an inequitable, carbon-heavy development trap or a much fairer zero-carbon path.
To achieve full decarbonization, development banks and African governments should move away from capital-intensive rail and bus rapid transit (BRT) projects, and toward enabling micro-entrepreneurs to build effective, electrified public transport networks.
The solution may lie in fostering impact-driven transport network companies (TNCs).
Although Africa is responsible for some 3% of cumulative global carbon dioxide emissions, it is urbanizing at lower levels of per capita GDP than any other region.
As the continent’s cities continue to expand, Africans increasingly need to travel – by motorized public transport, motorcycles, or private cars – in order to attain the same level of prosperity as people elsewhere.
Micro-entrepreneurs are meeting many of those transport needs by investing in vans and providing informal bus services that connect the urban dwellers with schools, hospitals, and jobs.
Such operations have helped Africa’s cities to grow, generated significant employment, and will continue to dominate public transport for a long time.
But the bus drivers, some of whom own their vehicles, are short of capital and rely on low-cost, low-tech, high-polluting vans.
Passengers aspire to own a private car, and those who can invest in a car-centric lifestyle, mimicking a development pattern that has failed elsewhere.
A development trap thus kicks in: African cities remain crowded, disconnected, and costly, reducing social mobility and entrenching economic inequality.
Fortunately, a range of urban and technology interventions can lead to a radically different development pathway.
The key is to re-imagine African streets and move away from the current car-focused design.
We should emphasize public transport, and give micro-entrepreneur bus operators priority lanes in exchange for meeting minimum vehicle-quality standards.
That implies electrifying van-buses and integrating them within multi-modal urban transport systems.
Achieving this transition will require development banks and governments to focus less on capital-intensive investment projects, which, while helpful and desirable, cannot and will not solve Africa’s transport problem.
Successful implementation of credit-backed metro and BRT projects in African cities is in doubt, owing to the current debt distress aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These schemes are at risk of being completed too late, and thus having too little impact as urbanization proceeds apace.
In Egypt, for example, the Cairo Metro, which is majority-financed by international development agencies, receives 92% of national investment in public transport.
This is one of two national projects, along with the Sustainable Transport Project (led by the United Nations Development Program), designed to mitigate Egypt’s CO2 emissions and use international climate-financing schemes.
But both projects combined cut annual CO2 emissions by less than is added each year as more people travel increasingly far.
Capital-intensive public transport projects will neither reform nor decarbonize African transportation.
Policymakers and lenders should instead focus on how venture capital-backed TNCs such as Uber (and its Middle Eastern subsidiary Careem), DiDi, and Lyft have revolutionized the traditional taxi industry with their tech-enabled mobility platforms.
This transition has resulted in significant operational efficiencies and might catalyze the electrification of the entire sector.
Uber recently pledged that all its rides in North American and European cities will take place in zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles by 2030, and plans to commit $800 million to help hundreds of thousands of micro-entrepreneur drivers buy battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2025.
In Africa, home-grown venture capital-backed TNCs such as SWVL in Egypt and SafeBoda in Uganda are active in the van and motorcycle markets, respectively.
But these firms offer a premium service and are not designed to scale up and become the transport providers that African cities need to prosper.
These companies have exercised meaningful control over micro-entrepreneurs operating within their networks in order to guarantee minimum quality standards, including by setting base fares, dictating which routes to take, and marketing to affluent consumers.
By treating their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, they have avoided the cost of providing benefits like health insurance.
A new model of private TNCs could help revolutionize informal bus services for the masses and achieve decarbonization.
Public support and regulation of private TNCs could help drivers gain more benefits and protections, making the transition beneficial for consumers, operators, and the environment alike.
Development banks and governments should therefore invest in street infrastructure, including dedicated bus lanes, stops, and electric vehicle charging stations, and they should finance vehicle upgrades by covering the cost difference between low-tech vans and BEVs.
TNCs would be able to channel the investments, work with public bodies to implement metropolitan-level multi-modal transport networks, and monitor and enforce quality standards using innovative, scalable technology.
We need to rethink Africa’s transport infrastructure and enable a transition that makes sense for hundreds of thousands of workers, some of whom are also micro-investors.
Achieving public-service goals will require governments to guide the sector, harnessing private-sector informal transport providers and TNCs while absorbing temporary risks and cost differences.
Public and international capital can close the cost gap that drivers will face in making the switch to BEVs and support them through the current pandemic-induced shock, which has led to an average decrease of 40% in public transport use in African cities.
Private capital would realize efficiencies, and distributed public micro-capital would allow many people to acquire a stake in an industry with widely shared gains.
Transforming African transport will require nothing less than the elimination of GHG-emitting vehicles.
Let’s aim for that, and help African cities to become better connected drivers of clean and equitable development.

Pakistan’s Persistent Energy Crisis
ISLAMABAD – For almost a decade, Pakistan has lacked the energy it needs, with producers and consumers across the country facing power outages for up to 12 hours per day.
At the root of this crisis lies poor governance.
Yet the authorities and aid donors alike stubbornly fail to recognize the obvious, and instead continue to pursue costly and ultimately ineffective interventions.
Pakistan’s experience is a case study in how poor countries can often struggle to formulate and implement reforms, including reforms needed to escape poverty.
And, indeed, Pakistan’s ongoing energy crisis is undermining its economic development: the Ministry of Finance estimates that energy shortages have reduced annual economic growth by two percentage points, on average, over the last nine years.
And it gets worse.
Over the same period, the government has spent more than 10% of GDP to cover the energy sector’s financial losses.
This means that, had Pakistan’s energy sector been reformed properly, the country’s economy could have grown significantly faster – by about 4% per year – potentially creating a sufficient number of jobs for a young and growing population.
Over the last nine years, Pakistan has received assistance through two International Monetary Fund programs and numerous World Bank initiatives, as well as from the Asian Development Bank and various donor agencies.
In exchange for funding, the IMF demanded huge increases in tax rates on petroleum products, as well as hikes in energy prices.
The World Bank, for its part, forced the government to use loan guarantees to spur private investment in energy.
Now, these guarantees are coming back to bite the government.
In a recent ad campaign, private power producers once again threatened to invoke them to secure payment of unpaid bills.
After some back and forth, including production slowdowns, the government, as usual, has opted to cover the losses.
Despite these huge costs, three successive governments have produced no white paper or policy analysis that sheds light on the issue, much less devised a strategy for preventing further financial losses.
No independent commission or task force has been created to examine the problem, either.
We are told that the crisis is too urgent to investigate what caused it.
Donors and the government claim that a solution is imminent: several billion dollars of supply are now coming on stream.
But simply spending more to supply more energy has been tried before – at huge cost to the country.
Meanwhile, energy-sector losses have often been passed on to the consumer through price increases, surcharges, and other taxes.
This is not a sustainable approach.
It is time for Pakistan to undertake a more thorough audit of its energy crisis.
When I was involved with the energy sector as a senior policymaker, I found it useful to use a systems approach to understand the structure of supply, the quality of regulation, the forces driving prices, and the impact of conservation policies on demand.
As it stands, energy supply and distribution in Pakistan is managed through a centralized government bureaucracy.
Private electricity producers and one privatized distribution company function as government contractors with a guaranteed margin.
The rest of the production and distribution companies operate as part of the government, with their parent ministry controlling their management, resources, and finances.
In this context, it should be no surprise that the system continues to incur major losses.
Despite talk of energy markets, the system is based on administered prices: While consumers pay the same price throughout the country, the regulatory authorities set different prices for production and distribution companies.
But whether those prices are determined by a careful balancing of supply and demand is far from guaranteed.
In fact, there is every reason to suspect that the regulatory authority has been captured.
While prices and tariffs are determined on a cost-plus basis, it is unclear whether costs are properly scrutinized.
Tariffs are set without regard for continuing losses or energy-sector inefficiencies, and the government routinely overrides the price-setting system to force consumers to cover the sector’s losses.
On the demand side, no serious conservation policy has been put in place.
On the contrary, systems and regulations seem practically designed for waste.
City land and building codes lend themselves to energy-intensive sprawl, as they favor single-family homes over flats.
Wide avenues, flyovers, and expressways promote cars, while virtually precluding pedestrians and bicycles.
Moreover, buildings and houses constructed of concrete with thin glass windows are inefficient to heat and cool.
And they are equipped with appliances that are not forced to meet energy standards, and therefore can be very energy-intensive, especially when it comes to the use of gas.
Yet insulation materials and energy-efficient appliances remain expensive, owing to tariff protections for incumbent producers using outmoded technologies.
There is a clear need for systemic reform of all aspects of Pakistan’s energy system.
The country must develop a sensible pricing mechanism, establish fact-based and independent regulation, create an efficient and decentralized supply system, and implement incentives for conservation.
To aid in this effort, the World Bank and the ADB must respond to as-yet-unanswered requests to provide Pakistan with competent technical assistance to develop a modern pricing mechanism and conduct a regulatory audit.
After nine years of quick-fix and temporary solutions, Pakistan and its donors need to recognize that its energy crisis can be resolved only through institutional reform.
Otherwise, losses will only grow – and not just in the energy sector. If allowed to continue, that accumulation of losses could even destabilize the state, with devastating consequences.

Japan’s Secret Demographic Weapon
NEW YORK – As the annual World Bank/International Monetary Fund meetings get underway in Tokyo, Japanese leaders must confront an unfolding demographic disaster.
Japan’s National Institute of Population and Social Security Research recently forecast that by 2060, the country will have lost nearly one-third of its 2010 population of 128 million, and just half of this smaller population will be between 15 and 65 years old – the most productive age group in any economy.
These are the kinds of numbers usually produced by wars and epidemics, and they imply both a dramatic drop in the number of young people able to provide for their elders and a much greater debt burden for a country that is already carrying one of the world’s heaviest.
To solve this problem, Japan’s political leaders have three options: find some way to raise the country’s birthrate dramatically, open a long-insular society to a wave of immigrants, or finally unveil the country’s secret weapon – the energy, talents, and ingenuity of Japanese women.
Opening the country to a surge of immigrants makes sense, but Japan is not about to become an American-style melting pot, and this solution alone would be inadequate to the scale of the demographic challenge.
Foreigners make up less than 2% of Japan’s population, and a United Nations report from 2001 found that Japan would need inflows averaging 609,000 immigrants per year until 2050 to maintain the percentage of its working-age population.
That is why Japanese policymakers should prioritize drawing more women into the workforce. For the moment, things are moving in the wrong direction.
Japan slipped from 80th place in the World Economic Forum’s gender-gap rankings in 2006 to 98th in 2011, a worrying sign that a critical opportunity is being missed.
For women in the workplace, Japan remains the Saudi Arabia of the developed world.
The first step toward reversing this trend could be to create work environments that are better suited to the needs of Japanese women, and that promote their talents.
Government officials have taken modest steps in this direction, but culture and inertia remain powerful obstacles.
Still, the prize for getting this right is worth the effort.
A 2010 Goldman Sachs study concludes that an increase in female labor-force participation rates to parity with men would add 8.2 million workers to Japan’s economy, virtually erase the projected decline in the country’s working-age population, and boost GDP growth by 15%.
The problem is not that Japanese women lack opportunities for higher education; the university enrollment rate for 18-year-old women already exceeded that of men in 2005.
But just 65% of women with college degrees are now working.
One problem is that working for Japanese firms often requires both long hours on the job and post-work socializing with colleagues – customs that make life harder for working mothers.
But Japanese men, who spend less time caring for children than fathers in most other industrialized countries, could share more of the responsibilities of parenting.
Better work-life balance would benefit both men and women.
And increasing the availability of affordable child care would help, too.
Those who resist feminizing the workforce might argue that doing so would mean fewer children – and thus a new demographic complication. But the evidence suggests otherwise.
OECD countries with higher female labor-force participation rates also have higher birth rates.
Japan’s birthrate has already fallen to just 1.37 children per female, far below the level that would keep the population constant.
Beyond the cultural obstacles, Japanese policymakers could take many concrete steps.
According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, 54.7% of women were employed on a non-regular basis in 2011.
Officials could encourage employers to offer women permanent, full-time positions, rather than all-too-common temporary contracts, which mean lower pay, less stability, and a lack of opportunity for advancement.
More important, current tax policies that reinforce women’s over-representation in temporary contract work should be changed.
Both the OECD and the Goldman Sachs study identify rules that discourage women from working. A “special dependent” exemption that could be claimed by heads of households (mainly men) for dependents (mainly women) who earned less than about $12,000 per year was eliminated in 2004, but a “dependent” exemption still remains.
Policymakers could also find creative ways to increase the odds that women will return to the labor market after having children. They could close Japan’s salary gender gap – wider than in any OECD country except South Korea – in part by establishing rules that reward performance rather than seniority.
Opening Japan to more immigrants could help it to meet its demographic challenge. But the more durable solution is already inside the country.

Inclusive Growth or Else
LONDON/WASHINGTON, DC – At this year’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, participants did not question the basic building blocks of growth in today’s global economy: free markets, good governance, and investment in human capital and infrastructure.
But they did criticize how unfairly the benefits of growth are being distributed.
Rightly so: without a strong policy response aimed at building a more inclusive growth model, rising populism and economic nationalism will impair the functioning of markets and overall macroeconomic stability – potentially cutting short the current global recovery.
Virtually every economic policy has an impact on both aggregate income and its distribution.
Some reforms – such as those promoting impartiality and efficiency of legal institutions – are good for growth and equity (in this case, equality of opportunity).
Incidence results for deregulation of product and labor markets are more mixed, possibly as a result of data limitations and the specific circumstances of each reform.
By contrast, when it comes to financial deregulation and the liberalization of international capital flows, there are clear equity-efficiency tradeoffs: they boost growth, but they also tend to increase inequality.
The evidence points in a similar direction for some measures aimed at liberalizing current-account transactions (trade in goods and services).
These findings should not come as a surprise: it is well-known that rapid technological change and globalization have contributed immensely to the creation of a winner-take-all economy, in which those with a first-mover advantage accrue a disproportionate share of the benefits of growth.
Policymakers’ task is to ensure that the disadvantaged also have opportunities to succeed in the modern economy, by designing all reforms and other measures with an eye to their distributional effects.
Otherwise, pro-growth reforms will lose political legitimacy, enabling destructive nationalist, nativist, and protectionist forces to continue to gain traction and thus to undermine medium- and longer-term growth.
The key to success will be to take preemptive action, rather than focusing solely (or even primarily) on ameliorative measures.
This means designing coherent policy packages that internalize the distributional effects of supply-enhancing policies, and that aim to create a better balance of winners and losers across those policies.
In our work for the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Economic Progress, we have produced a list of concrete actions that would advance such an agenda.
The first critical area of focus is skills training, skills upgrading, and addressing job displacement.
Globalization and the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution have increased the pace of change in labor markets, putting a premium on adaptability.
Public policies have a role to play not only in providing a cushion for workers in transition, via income support, but also in creating incentives and opportunities for skills acquisition.
To this end, governments should boost investment in life-long learning to retrain, retool, and reskill.
For example, governments could use individual skill accounts to provide training grants throughout people’s working lives, conditional on stronger private-sector involvement in training and skills development.
Governments should also reinforce the supply of skills by strengthening incentives for educational institutions to harness the power of digital technology and new business models.
A second critical area is taxation and social protection.
While the specific policies would vary according to national social contracts, our work suggests that redistribution – unless extreme – does not bring salient efficiency losses.
Moreover, the greater equity it brings serves to make economic growth more sustainable, such as by reducing systemic fragilities that can lead to sharp downturns.
When it comes to taxes, it is critical to safeguard the growth model’s political legitimacy by ensuring that the system is not skewed in favor of the wealthy.
Beyond increased taxation of rents and estates, policymakers should pursue cooperative efforts to stem corporate tax avoidance, tax inversions, and the use of tax shelters.
Fiscal transfers should also be better targeted, in order to protect the most vulnerable groups.
Similarly – and this is the third critical reform priority – more aggressive action is needed to regulate financial markets, especially to prevent insider trading and money laundering, and to close down illegal financial centers.
Cross-border regulations and measures are also needed to ensure that risk-takers bear an appropriately high cost for recklessness. More generally, countries need to avail themselves of the tools at their disposal to manage cross-border capital flows, with the objective of mitigating the risk of financial crises and their associated fiscal costs.
The fourth and final priority is a more concerted effort to ensure fair competition and avoid crony capitalism.
Guaranteeing a level national playing field and a rules-based international order requires effective competition policies and enforcement of fair-trade rules.
Whether in industry, services, or the media, anti-trust actions to avoid capture of institutions or industries – by the powerful or the state – are vital to support inclusiveness.
The backlash against globalization – and, in some cases, against capitalism itself – demands economic policies that not only address problematic distributional effects, but also preempt them.
This will require a fundamental change in mindset, with businesses and governments alike recognizing, at long last, that growth can be sustainable only if its benefits are broadly shared.
The decision to place inequality at the center of the discussion at Davos this year was a promising development.
But actual solutions remain undeveloped.
Despite expressions of anguish about widening economic disparities within many countries, policies to address them remain inadequate.
This must change if the current economic recovery – the source of so much relief and hope around the globe – is to continue.

Unblocking Corporate Governance Reform
CAMBRIDGE – When they met earlier this month, G-20 finance ministers and central bankers called for global improvements in corporate governance.
Such appeals are often heard, but powerful vested interests make it hard for governments to follow through.
So, if serious reforms are to be implemented, strong and persistent public pressure will be needed.
Many countries provide investors in publicly traded firms with levels of protection that are patently inadequate.
Even in countries with well-developed systems of corporate governance, arrangements that are excessively lax on corporate insiders persist.
In the United States, for example, insiders enjoy protections from takeovers that, according to a substantial body of empirical evidence, actually decrease company value.
Lax corporate governance rules are not generally the result of a lack of knowledge by public officials.
Political impediments often enable lax arrangements to linger even after they are recognized as inefficient.
Ordinarily, corporate governance issues are not followed by most citizens.
As a result, politicians expect that their decisions on investor protection will have little direct effect on citizens’ voting decisions.
By contrast, interest groups with big stakes in the rules follow corporate governance issues closely, and they lobby politicians to get favorable regulations.
The group that, in normal times, can be expected to have the most influence is that which consists of insiders within publicly-traded companies.
Corporate insiders are an especially powerful lobbying group because of their ability to use some of the resources of the companies under their control.
They have the power to direct their firms’ campaign contributions, to offer positions or business to politicians’ relatives or associates (or to politicians upon retirement), and to use their businesses to support issues and causes that politicians seek to advance.
Because insiders gain the full benefits that arise through lobbying for lax corporate governance rules, while their firms bear most of the costs of such lobbying, insiders have an advantage in the competition for influence over politicians.
Their lobbying, which is carried out at the expense of their companies, is subsidized by their shareholders.
While individual investors cannot be expected to invest in lobbying for stronger investor protection, it might be hoped that institutional investors – mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, and so forth – will do so.
Institutional investors receive funds from individuals and invest them in publicly traded companies.
Because institutional investors invest substantial amounts in such companies, they should be well informed about corporate governance issues.
But institutional investors usually do not provide a sufficient counter-weight to lobbying by corporate insiders.
In contrast to corporate insiders, institutional investors cannot charge the costs of lobbying to the publicly traded companies whose investor protection is at stake.
In addition, depending on their relationship with their own investors, some institutional investors (for example, mutual fund managers) may capture only a limited fraction of the increase in value of their portfolios as a result of governance reforms.
This reduces the willingness of institutional investors to invest in counteracting insider lobbying.
Moreover, those who make decisions for institutional investors often have interests that discourage lobbying for stronger constraints on corporate insiders.
Some institutional investors are part of publicly traded firms, and are consequently under the control of corporate insiders whose interests are not served by new constraints.
And even those institutional investors that are not affiliated with publicly traded companies may have an interest in getting business from such companies, making these institutional investors reluctant to push for reforms that corporate insiders oppose.
So, interest-group politics commonly produce substantial obstacles to reform of corporate governance.
However, some events – such as a wave of corporate scandals or a stock market crash – can interrupt the ordinary pro-insider operations of interest-group politics by leading ordinary citizens to pay attention corporate governance failures.
When citizens become so outraged that their voting decisions may be affected by politicians’ failure to improve investor protection, public demand for governance reform can overcome the power of vested interests.
Indeed, most major governance reforms occur in such circumstances.
In the US, for example, new securities laws were passed following the stock market crash of 1929, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was adopted in 2002, in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Internet bubble and the Enron and WorldCom scandals.
By creating a large public demand for reforms, the current crisis offers another opportunity to improve governance arrangements.
This opportunity should not be missed.

Can Tunisia’s Democracy Survive?
TUNIS – When anti-government protests swept across the Arab world in 2011, Tunisia seemed poised to emerge better off.
Yet, by 2013, the democratic process was almost derailed by unfulfilled economic promises, political and ideological disagreements, and foreign meddling.
Fortunately, local and international mediation then helped to avert catastrophe and pave the way for elections.
But less than a year before the next general election, scheduled for late 2019, the country is again in crisis.
This time, however, mediators are either disinterested in solutions or part of the problem. In a world focused on the war in Syria, instability in Libya, Russian assertiveness, European uncertainty, and the tweets of an isolationist American president, Tunisia has faded from the headlines.
Tunisia’s democratic breakdown would, one assumes, attract international attention; but by then, it will be too late.
The current stalemate began soon after the December 2014 presidential election.
In February 2015, President Beji Caid Essebsi, founder of the secular political party Nidaa Tounes, struck a deal with Rached Ghannouchi, president of the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, to form a coalition government.
But soon after, Nidaa Tounes was beset by infighting and, in January 2016, dozens of the party’s MPs resigned in protest, giving Ennahda a parliamentary majority.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, Essebsi’s protégé and appointee, has been challenging the 92-year-old president’s inner circle, throwing Nidaa Tounes further into chaos.
By mid-2018, as the party’s turmoil peaked, Ghannouchi was supporting Chahed rather than the president’s son and groomed heir, Hafedh Caid Essebsi.
The president, reacting either to a sense of betrayal or out of fear for his legacy, responded by renewing his criticism of Ennahda and by launching an investigation into allegations that Ghannouchi’s party is tied to terrorism.
Moreover, Essebsi and his clan embraced populist rhetoric and restarted courting the anti-Islamist Saudi-Emirati-Egyptian axis.
Essebsi even endorsed a law to give men and women equal inheritance rights, a measure that is supported by many secular Tunisians and praised by the international community, but loathed by Ennahda’s conservative base.
Amid this brewing political turmoil, rumors of coups and attempted coups have intensified.
In June 2018, Tunisia’s interior minister was fired over an alleged coup attempt.
In November, Nidaa Tounes’ secretary-general accused Chahed of planning his own putsch.
In December, Qatari-backed news outlets warned of a Saudi-Emirati plot to stage a coup in Tunisia.
And every now and then, Tunisian social media buzzes with unfounded rumors of army movements.
It seems as if trial balloons are being floated.
In a well-functioning democracy, an early election would have been called in September 2018, when the governing coalition felt apart, and perhaps as early as 2016, when Nidaa Tounes lost its majority in parliament.
But most Tunisian political parties suffer too much dissension or are too weak to run.
And the current ructions are even jeopardizing the work of the Independent High Authority for Elections.
There is now a real risk that the 2019 elections will be postponed.
For a fragile democracy led by a nonagenarian, saddled by an endless state of emergency, and lacking a constitutional court, this delay may prove fatal.
Tunisia’s political crisis is occurring alongside an economic one.
As Tunisia has moved from a controlled economy under dictatorship to a transitional one marked by austerity measures and structural reforms dictated by the International Monetary Fund, corruption has spread and investors have fled.
Today, with public debt, unemployment, and inflation growing, strikes and protests are increasingly common, and support for democracy – frequently portrayed as the cause of the current tumult – has dwindled.
Ennahda, an economically liberal party that draws important support from informal economic circles and outside the public sector, backed the IMF’s economic reforms; the Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT), which represents public-sector workers, did not.
Leftists and many remnants of the former regime were also opposed.
Chahed, meanwhile, was aggressive in implementing the IMF-backed reforms, in part to win support from abroad.
But his approach put the UGTT, alongside old-guard politicians and some key socioeconomic groups, on the same side as Essebsi.
In fact, the UGTT led the mediations during the crisis of 2013.
Foreign influence is another destabilizing factor.
Today, Tunisia is a geopolitical battlefield for regional powers like Egypt, Turkey, and the Gulf states, and Tunisian politicians occasionally take sides to suit their suitors’ goals.
Broadly speaking, Saudi Arabia and the UAE demonize Tunisia’s democracy and Ennahda, while Qatar and Turkey laud both.
Both camps have their clients in the country. These players amplify coup rumors and delegitimize Tunisia’s political independence, which adds to the public’s distrust of the government.
Back in 2013, the US, Europe, and Algeria limited the reach of these countries.
Ironically, in 2018, it is the US, the EU, and Algeria that are rattled by internal divisions and terrified of foreign interference.
History holds many lessons for those navigating Tunisia’s tumult, with some particularly apt parallels to be found in Russia’s post-Soviet transition.
There, during his final years in power, a weakened Boris Yeltsin sought to secure his presidential legacy and save his family from prosecution.
Hence, the so-called “father of Russian democracy” appointed then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, to succeed him.
Russia’s democracy never recovered.
Tunisia’s infighting and nepotistic policies have a similar feel.
The Arab world’s most promising democratic experiment can still avert a political meltdown, but it needs help.
Local and international mediators guided Tunisia from turmoil once before.
They must do so again.

Why Rabies Still Kills
SINGAPORE – A virus that infects your brain, makes you want to bite things, and is almost always fatal after symptoms appear probably sounds like something from a zombie movie.
But this has been the modus operandi of rabies at least since 2300 BC, when it was described in the Eshuma Code of Babylon.
The word’s Sanskrit etymology – rabhas, meaning “to do violence” – dates back even further, to 3000 BC.
In principle, no human in this day and age should die from rabies, and yet, according to a 2015 study, the virus kills 59,000 people annually.
That’s 160 people every day, and the actual number might be far higher if we could count unreported or untreated cases.
Most of these deaths occur in Asia and Africa, with India alone accounting for one-third of the world’s total mortality from rabies.
That total is not as high as the death toll from tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria; but, unlike those diseases, every mammal appears to be susceptible to rabies.
Dogs, the predominant host in most regions, can become infected from any rabid wild animal, and then infect humans.
Dogs showing symptoms may bite a human, but they can also transmit the virus simply by licking if their saliva comes into contact with a scratch, damaged skin, or mucosa.
The rabies virus hijacks the nervous system and actually manipulates neural processes to make its host move faster.
Infected humans will eventually hallucinate, become aggressive, and even fear water in the advanced stages of the disease.
Once these symptoms appear, rabies has no known cure, and death is almost certain.
Fortunately, unlike most vaccine-preventable diseases, rabies allows for post-exposure inoculation, because the time of infection is generally known by the victim – especially if they were bitten – and the disease’s incubation period is relatively long, ranging from days to years, but averaging three to eight weeks.
Whether administered before or after exposure, the vaccine is the same, but the immunization schedule and the dosage differ between the two scenarios.
French scientist Louis Pasteur formulated the first rabies vaccine in 1885, by injecting the virus into rabbits, waiting for it to kill them, and then drying the infected nerve tissues to weaken the virus to the point that it could be safely administered.
Then he successfully tested it on a nine-year-old boy who had been bitten by a rabid dog.
In today’s world, Pasteur would be thrown in jail for practicing as an unlicensed physician and not following proper clinical-practice standards; but we can all be thankful for his discovery.
Today, rabies vaccines are grown in a lab using cell cultures.
The virus is then rendered inactive, purified, and administered by injection into the arm.
The World Health Organization recommends pre-exposure vaccinations for anyone whose occupation or residence implies continual, frequent, or increased risk of encountering rabies.
This applies to everyone in rabies-endemic countries; unfortunately, not everyone in these countries gets vaccinated.
The rabies vaccine is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines, and has an average wholesale price of $11 per dose in the developing world, and as much as $250 per dose in the United States.
Of course, because the alternative to post-exposure vaccination is death, the treatment is extremely cost-effective however one looks at it.
Smallpox, which is believed to have emerged even before rabies, has now been eradicated, and programs are currently under way to put an end to polio, Guinea worm disease, and other infectious ailments.
So why is rabies still prevalent?
One reason is that the virus is almost always transmitted by animals, rather than by other humans.
To address this, we should be investing in pet vaccinations, reducing wild- and stray-animal populations, and enforcing strict quarantines on animals crossing national borders.
In developed countries, preventing rabies largely requires controlling and immunizing wildlife populations, which has proved effective in Switzerland and Germany.
In Latin American countries where bat rabies is a threat, bovine vaccines have been used, as have anticoagulants, to kill bats that feed off the blood of the treated cattle.
Ultimately, the world’s poorest regions still bear most of the rabies burden.
Dogs are not widely vaccinated, as they are in developed countries; and even when they are, their populations turn over very rapidly.
Within a year of a large-scale vaccination effort, a new population of unvaccinated dogs will be roaming the streets and increasing the chances of an outbreak.
Meanwhile, developing countries’ health-care systems are already grappling with tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria; and post-exposure prophylaxis supplies are limited.
Barring real progress on these challenges, one of the world’s oldest known viruses will continue to afflict humans and animals alike.

Down and Out in the United States?
For most of the past decade the world has been lectured to by Americans who proclaimed the perfection of the US economy: its focus on competition, loose labor regulation, and a modest social safety net, all of which supposedly delivered dynamism and high growth rates.
Continental Europeans were told to follow the US model and liberalize their labor markets, so that businesses that want to hire can do so without losing money and so that unemployed workers who find new jobs won't see their wages offset by cuts in welfare-state benefits.
Japanese were told to socialize the losses their banking system incurred when Japan's bubble burst, then re-privatize those parts of it that could still succeed as going concerns and liquidate the rest.
East Asia's Tigers were told to abandon the German-Japanese financial system based on universal banking and adopt the Anglo-American model based on liquid financial markets.
They were also admonished to do a better job at regulating their financial system.
Other developing countries were told that their trade barriers, their love of inflationary finance, their failure to curb tax evasion, and their lack of governments strong enough to enforce property and contract rights against local notables, organized bandits, and - most important - their own functionaries were keeping them from participating in the new globalized economic cornucopia.
Now it's "pay back" time, when the world lectures America about how to fix its no-longer-perfect economy.
But can this criticism be constructive, not a bout (pleasurable, of course) of Schadenfreude ?
The most obvious piece of advice is that America's financial system should follow more faithfully the advice its advocates dispensed to others.
In some countries, corporate managers are disciplined by the representatives of large universal banks who sit on corporate boards and vote large blocks of shares.
In many countries, managers' leashes are also held by families of plutocrats who exercise control through pyramids of companies and special classes of stock.
America's model of corporate governance was supposed to rely on the following set of factors:
· managerial failures were supposed to trigger hostile takeovers;
· even before a takeover occurs, managers were supposed to be disciplined by fears of a revolt by their boards of directors, especially when the directors think that the company might be become a target of a hostile takeover;
· managers were to pursue good performance at all costs, because their stock options and other performance-related compensation made their own fortunes tied to that of shareholders and the corporation.
Within those constraints, American managers were supposed to exercise considerably more discretion than their foreign counterparts, so that they could use their business judgment without being shackled and second-guessed.
Combined, all of this was supposed to deliver dynamism.
But for this system to work solid information about under-performing companies must be available to investors and the link between the pay of top managers and company performance must be real.
Instead, what evolved was a lax accounting system and a "heads you win, tails your options will be re-priced and you still win" method of managerial compensation.
No surprise, then, that bosses who couldn't legitimately show the market strong profits cooked the books, often with the help of their supposedly independent accountants.
As things stand, it is in no one's short-term interest, certainly not in the short-run interest of accounting firms that make more money from consulting contracts than from doing a company's books, to allow accurate information - if it is bad - to leak into the market.
Other countries must then tell America that the state can't stand back and let the market do this job: accurate business information is a governmental responsibility.
Moreover, the greed of bosses cannot be the sole determinant of managerial remuneration.
Unfortunately, America now has an administration keen to downplay the importance of timely reporting of insider stock sales (the President himself failed to do that when he was in business), the timely reporting of changes in the accounting treatment of a company's unrealized revenues (something that did happen at Halliburton when it was run by Vice President Cheney), and of executives' duty to know about the fraud committed by their subordinates (unlike what happened when current Army Secretary White was running Enron's energy trading operations).
Outsiders should also remind America that its population is aging and that big savings will be needed to pay for the looming retirement of the baby boomers.
Two years ago "Save Social Security" (America's state pension system) was a political mantra.
The huge federal budget surplus was supposed to provide the means to do that.
President Bush's tax cut, however, squandered the surplus.
Huge deficits reappeared.
Outsiders must remind America that its pension system is a ticking time bomb that must be defused.
Third and last, the past two decades saw America change from a largely middle-class society of the same genus as Europe's social democracies into a creature with extremes of wealth unseen since before World War I. One driving force behind this is America's retreat from its unique emphasis on education.
Declining public school quality, downward pressure on funding for public higher education, and a failure of political will to make higher education affordable for everyone has produced a growing education gap among those who can and cannot afford quality education.
So while the economic case for greater private and public investment in education is stronger than ever, most individuals can't save enough to pay for it, and education - despite all the talk of politicians - is not the federal priority it should be.
After lording it over the world for so long, Americans should accept today's rebukes with grace.
But if the rest of the world really wants to help, it should lecture America along the lines I suggest.
Some of us might listen.

The Pandemic Threat to Female Leadership
STANFORD – One in four.
That’s the proportion of American women who are considering downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce due to the impact of COVID-19.
In just one year, the pandemic has driven more than two million women in the United States out of the workplace, resulting in the largest male-female unemployment gap in two decades.
Working mothers, more than 40% of whom are their family’s primary breadwinner, have been especially hit hard.
Many simply are unable to balance their careers with overwhelming increases in household responsibilities at home.
This mirrors similar trends globally – across all regions, women lost jobs at a greater rate than men in 2020, as they took on an average of 30 more hours of childcare per week.
COVID-19 is causing women to leave the workforce in droves just when we urgently need to elevate more of them into leadership positions across sectors, including in our own field of global health.
Without women’s expertise, leadership talents, and unique perspectives, the road to recovery could be far longer, and we risk being underprepared for the next health crisis, particularly given the pandemic’s clear gendered effects.
And having women in leadership positions has been shown to result in more policies that improve people’s quality of life and reflect the priorities of families and marginalized communities – the very groups disproportionately affected by this pandemic.
In global health, women’s voices are crucial to driving intentional, holistic action on important challenges that too often are missed when the vast majority of decision-makers are men.
When women are not at the table, the consequences are serious.
This pandemic has led to increases in domestic violence and suspensions or delays in sexual and reproductive health services, often leaving unprepared governments struggling to respond.
For too long, we lacked sex-disaggregated data, including on how both COVID-19 infection and vaccination affect pregnant women, simply because researchers do not routinely investigate these questions.
We will continue to struggle with these and other issues unless women are better represented in decision-making.
But as we rebuild from the devastation of COVID-19, we have an opportunity to embrace new and better ways of working so that parents do not have to choose between their careers and their family responsibilities – and so that women can thrive and lead.
In global health, like in other fields, this starts with acknowledging and breaking down barriers and urging those in positions of power to embrace the necessary changes in policies, allocation of resources, and cultural norms.
For starters, we must make our workplaces more family-friendly through measures such as flexible schedules, subsidized childcare, and family leave.
We must also dismantle the sexist biases that hold back women in their careers, including false, negative assumptions about mothers that have adverse implications in hiring and promotion decisions.
Furthermore, we need to recognize that pandemic-related challenges have not affected all women equally.
In the US, like in many other countries, women who already face additional hurdles – whether because they are black, Hispanic, or unpartnered mothers – have shouldered an even heavier load.
We must advocate for policies that can correct this imbalance.
In particular, such policies should include universal childcare, which helps address inequalities faced by marginalized women.
Women should not have to sacrifice their health, work, or leadership potential in the pursuit of the mythical “work-life balance.”
The best leadership we can muster – drawing from all humankind, and not just 50% of it – is needed to improve health outcomes and the well-being of people around the world.
Millions of women have already left the workforce during this pandemic, and many more are thinking of doing so.
If we do not act now to reverse this trend, the gap may become insurmountable.
We cannot afford to lose the very people who will help lead us out of this health emergency and future ones, too.

The Science of Acupuncture
Like many other traditional Chinese medicines, acupuncture has for many centuries been viewed suspiciously in the West.
It seems to work, but how?
Is a scientific answer possible?
Most Chinese doctors and patients have, for example, long regarded acupuncture as an effective treatment for stroke, using it to improve motor, speech, and other functions that have been destroyed.
One survey showed that 66% of Chinese doctors use acupuncture routinely to treat the effects of stroke, with 63% of the doctors surveyed believing it to be effective.
Some 36% of Chinese doctors think the effectiveness of acupuncture remains uncertain, perhaps because the scientific basis for it remains so new.
Recently, however, systematic scientific studies of acupuncture’s effects in such treatment has begun.
Almost all trials on acupuncture as a treatment for stroke conducted within China have been positive.
But another recent study done in the UK showed that research conducted in several countries was uniformly favorable to acupuncture as a treatment for the damage caused by stroke.
Indeed, all the trials performed before June 1995 in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were deemed positive by the British researchers.
The Cochrane Collaboration, an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information, conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture, including 14 trials, of which 10 were conducted in China, involving 1,208 patients.
Acupuncture started within 30 days of stroke onset, with control groups receiving a placebo – sham acupuncture – or no treatment.
Compared to patients who received sham acupuncture or no treatment, far fewer of those who received acupuncture died or became invalid within three months.
After three months or more of treatment, the numbers rose even more significantly in favor of those treated by acupuncture.
Oddly, when comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, the statistical difference concerning death or the need for institutional care was small.
Indeed, another analysis, including 14 randomized trials with 1,213 patients six months after a stroke, compared the effects of conventional stroke rehabilitation with and without acupuncture as a supplement.
Acupuncture was found to have no additional effect on motor recovery, but a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo effect, or to the varied quality of the trials.
Indeed, the efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies—a problem that has affected most of trials undertaken so far.
For example, many trials did not describe their method of measuring statistical relevance, and only called themselves “randomized controlled trials.”
Only four trials, with 373 patients, could provide data on death or dependency (becoming dependent on others for activities of daily living).
And only three trials—all conducted in Europe—used sham acupuncture as a control, whereas no acupuncture trials controlled with placebos or sham acupuncture have been reported in China, owing to high cultural barriers.
Part of the problem in China is choosing the patients to be studied.
After all, patients come to hospitals that practice traditional Chinese medicine because they already believe in acupuncture and are likely to be using it to treat another illness.
Getting such patients to accept being put into a control group where no acupuncture is applied is almost impossible.
This difficulty makes random studies of the effects of acupuncture treatment on stroke patients particularly difficult in a traditional Chinese medicine hospital.
More fundamentally, however, Chinese doctors who use traditional medicine argue that outcome measures of acupuncture as a treatment for stroke should be different from conventional measures used in Western trials, because the theory of acupuncture is different.
But no one has yet specified what the appropriate outcome measures for acupuncture should be.
A recent study conducted in China, including 862 patients who were between the second and tenth day after onset of acute stroke, is the largest truly randomized trial using death or dependency as the primary outcome.
The patients were randomly allocated to an acupuncture group receiving acupuncture treatment plus routine treatment or a control group receiving routine treatment alone.
The results will be reported after analysis of the trial data and could prove useful for therapy of stroke patients.
At present, however, there is insufficient evidence for routine use of acupuncture in stroke.
More high-quality trials are needed.
We do know that acupuncture is a safe, inexpensive, widely accepted, and potentially effective therapy.
Particularly at a time when standard rehabilitation is not available for most Chinese stroke patients, few will wait to try acupuncture until its role is confirmed or refuted by reliable evidence.

Abe’s Long March
TOKYO – Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo’s coalition government has decided to “reinterpret” the postwar Japanese constitution.
According to Article 9 of the constitution, drafted by American lawyers in 1946, when Japan was under Allied occupation, Japan renounces “war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.”
The new interpretation would allow Japan to use military force in support of an ally if Japanese security is under threat.
Abe chose to reinterpret the constitution because revising it would require the approval of two-thirds of the Japanese Diet.
Given that most Japanese are still allergic to military force, securing the necessary votes would have been impossible.
The reinterpretation will almost certainly result in protests from China and South Korea against resurgent Japanese militarism.
Because Abe is the nationalist grandson of a former prime minister who was once arrested as a war criminal, and because he has paid public tribute to soldiers who died for the emperor in World War II, these protests might seem reasonable.
Abe’s break with Japan’s pacifist consensus is beyond doubt.
But the circumstances under which Japan would use force are so restricted that a revival of militarism is still a very long way off.
More worrying is the effect on Japanese democracy: Elected governments do not simply change the meaning of the constitution without even bothering to get parliamentary support.
There is, however, an odd contradiction in Abe’s nationalism.
Constitutional pacifism was part of the postwar order imposed by the United States during occupation and largely supported by the Japanese people, who were tired of war.
Unlike in Germany, Japan had no Hitler or Nazi party on which to blame their wartime atrocities.
What needed to be purged instead, postwar reformers believed, was a specific form of Japanese militarism, rooted in emperor worship, the samurai tradition, authoritarian “feudalism,” and so on.
Much in the remaking of Japan after 1945 is still to be admired: democracy, women’s suffrage, land reform, freedom of speech.
But taking away Japan’s sovereign right to use military force had one major consequence: Japanese security was put almost entirely into American hands, reducing Japan to the status of a vassal state.
That is why the main goal of nationalist-minded Japanese leaders, starting with Abe’s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, has been the return of full Japanese sovereignty by revising Article 9.
That was not possible when Kishi was prime minister in the late 1950s.
The Japanese were not ready for it and Kishi was tainted by his wartime record as Minister of Munitions.
Abe’s dream is to make it happen now – and to go further.
He would like to restore some aspects of an older Japan, discredited by Japanese military behavior, such as patriotic pride, a more central role for the imperial institution, and even a reappraisal of Japan’s wartime record itself.
Hence his tributes to the Yasukuni Shrine, where the souls of imperial soldiers, including notorious war criminals, are worshipped.
Many Asians, including some Japanese, see this as a sign of new militarism.
Abe would like it to be viewed as an attempt to restore Japan’s international reputation as a “normal country.”
But Abe’s idea of normality is not yet shared by the majority of Japanese, let alone other Asians.
The contradiction in Abe’s nationalism is this: even as he talks about sovereignty regained and patriotic pride, he has done nothing to distance Japan from the postwar dominance of the US.
On the contrary, his reinterpretation of the constitution is meant to help the US in its military policing of East Asia.
In fact, what appears to be driving Abe’s endeavors even more than the desire to revise the postwar order in Japan is a widely shared fear of China’s increasing regional dominance.
A cursory glance at the Japanese press, or even the kind of books piled high in Japanese bookstores, shows just how frightened the Japanese are.
All of the talk in Tokyo is about Chinese aggression in the East and South China Seas.
Abe’s reinterpretation, then, is not really a radical departure from the postwar order at all.
China’s growing power has actually reinforced Japanese dependence on the US for its security.
Japan’s main worry is that the US may not wish to risk a war with China over territorial disputes in the East China Sea.
What is feared most, in addition to the rise of China, is the possible decline of the US.
The Japan-US alliance is an irritation to the Chinese, who would like the US to get out of the way, in order to be Asia’s dominant player.
Or so they say in public.
In fact, Chinese attitudes may be more complicated and less unified than they seem.
Indeed, China faces a rather stark choice. Either it must live with the continued Pax Americana in Asia, for as long as it lasts, or face a more independent, nuclear-armed Japan.
Privately, many Chinese might still prefer the former.
This may seem to be the most stable solution. In fact, it is fraught with danger.
To be sure, the US military presence still imposes a certain order with which most parties can live; but it risks dragging the world’s largest military power into petty regional conflicts, a prospect that should alarm us one century after 1914.
