Women, Life, Freedom, and the Left
LJUBLJANA – Four events centering around women have made headlines over the past month: Giorgia Meloni’s electoral victory in Italy, Queen Elizabeth II’s death and funeral, the release of the film The Woman King, and the widespread protests in Iran following the killing of Mahsa Amini by the country’s morality police.
Taken together, these four stories highlight essential features of the political terrain.
With the left failing to offer an adequate response to the crisis of liberal democracy, the rise of new right-wing governments in Europe is not particularly surprising. But women’s central role in this movement has yet to receive the attention it deserves.
Right-wing leaders like Meloni and Marine Le Pen in France are presenting themselves as stronger alternatives to traditional mainstream masculine technocrats.
They embody both right-wing hardness and features usually associated with femininity, such as a focus on care and the family: fascism with a human face.
Now consider the televised spectacle of Elizabeth II’s funeral, which highlighted an interesting paradox: as the British state has fallen ever further from its former superpower status, the British royal family’s ability to inspire imperial reveries has only grown.
We should not dismiss this as ideology masking actual power relations.
Rather, monarchical fantasies are themselves a part of the process whereby power relations reproduce themselves.
Elizabeth II’s death reminded us of the modern distinction between reigning and ruling, with the former being confined only to ceremonial duties.
The monarch is expected to radiate compassion, kindness, and patriotism, and to stay out of political conflicts.
As such, monarchs represent not the transcendence of ideology but rather ideology in its purest form.
For seven decades, Elizabeth II’s role was to serve as the face of state power.
The coincidence of her death with Prime Minister Liz Truss’s rise to power may have been highly contingent, but it was also deeply symbolic of the shift from Queen to Woman King.
In her new role, Truss has partly preempted the left by mixing energy subsidies with tax cuts for the rich.
Gina Prince-Bythewood’s The Woman King also deals with the political logic of monarchy.
A historical epic about the Agojie, an all-female warrior unit that protected the West African kingdom of Dahomey from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it stars Viola Davis as the fictional general Nanisca.
She is subordinated only to King Ghezo, a real-life figure who ruled Dahomey from 1818 to 1859, and who engaged in the Atlantic slave trade until the end of his reign.
In the film, the Agojie’s enemies include slave traders led by Santo Ferreira, a fictional character loosely inspired by Francisco Félix de Sousa.
But, in fact, de Sousa was a Brazilian slave trader who helped Ghezo gain power, and Dahomey was a kingdom that conquered other African states and sold their people into the slave trade.
While Nanisca is depicted protesting to the king against the slave trade, the real Agojie served him.
The Woman King thus promotes a form of feminism favored by the Western liberal middle class.
Like today’s #MeToo feminists, the Amazon warriors from Dahomey will ruthlessly condemn all forms of binary logic, patriarchy, and traces of racism in everyday language; but they will be very careful not to disturb the deeper forms of exploitation that underpin modern global capitalism and the persistence of racism.
This stance involves downplaying two basic facts about slavery.
First, white slave traders barely had to set foot on African soil, because privileged Africans (like the kingdom of Dahomey) furnished them with an ample supply of fresh slaves.
And, second, the slave trade was widespread not only in western Africa but also in its eastern parts, where Arabs enslaved millions, and where the institution lasted longer than in the West (Saudi Arabia didn’t formally abolish it until 1962).
Indeed, Muhammad Qutb, the brother of the Egyptian Muslim intellectual Sayyid Qutb, vigorously defended Islamic slavery from Western criticism.
Arguing that “Islam gave spiritual enfranchisement to slaves,” he contrasted the adultery, prostitution, and casual sex (“that most odious form of animalism”) found in the West with the “clean and spiritual bond that ties a maid [a slave girl] to her master in Islam.”
One still hears such talk from some conservative Salafi scholars, such as Sheikh Saleh Al-Fawzan, a member of Saudi Arabia’s highest religious body. But one wouldn’t know it from listening only to Western middle-class liberals.
Fortunately, Islam’s historical associations with slavery need not impede predominantly Muslim societies’ emancipatory potential.
The massive protests in Iran have a world-historical significance, because they combine different struggles (against women’s oppression, religious oppression, and state terror) into an organic unity.
Iran is not part of the developed West, and the protesters’ slogan “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” (“woman, life, freedom”) is not some mere offshoot of #MeToo or Western feminism.
Though it has mobilized millions of ordinary women, it speaks to a much broader struggle, and it eschews the anti-masculine tendency that one often finds in Western feminism.
The Iranian men who are chanting “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” know that the struggle for women’s rights is also the struggle for their own freedom – that the oppression of women is merely the most visible manifestation of a larger system of state terror.
Moreover, the events in Iran are something that still awaits us in the developed Western world, where the trends toward political violence, religious fundamentalism, and the oppression of women are accelerating.
We in the West have no right to treat Iran as a country that is desperately trying to catch up with us.
Rather, it is we who must learn from Iranians if we are going to have any chance of confronting right-wing violence and oppression in the United States, Hungary, Poland, Russia, and many other countries.
Whatever the immediate result of the protests, the crucial thing is to keep the movement alive, by organizing social networks that can continue to operate underground in the event that the forces of state oppression achieve a temporary victory.
It is not enough simply to express sympathy or solidarity with the Iranian protesters, as if they belong to some faraway exotic culture.
All the relativist babble about cultural specificities and sensitivities is now meaningless.
We can and should see the Iranian struggle as synonymous with our own.
We don’t need female figureheads or Woman Kings; we need women who will mobilize us all for “woman, life, freedom,” and against hate, violence, and fundamentalism.

The G20 Must Recommit to COVAX
GENEVA – It is one year since the international community gave its backing to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility to lead a worldwide effort to end the acute phase of the pandemic.
The initiative aimed to ensure that every country, and not just those with sufficient money or resources, could access life-saving vaccines once they became available. As G20 health ministers prepare to meet in Rome on September 5-6, they are in a position to ensure that COVAX fulfills its mission.
A year ago, no one knew when or even if it might be possible to develop a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19, let alone the 20 that are available today.
But since making its first international deliveries in February, COVAX – a partnership established by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – has delivered more than 235 million vaccine doses to 139 countries.
Only China, India, and the United States have delivered more.
This start to the largest and most complex vaccine rollout in history has given hope to millions of people and laid solid foundations for how we respond to future pandemics.
Yet, so much more could, and should, have been achieved by now.
It is unacceptable that only 1.8% of people in low-income countries have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 82% in high- and upper-middle-income countries.
This shocking inequality is as economically senseless as it is destructive to human life, with the latest estimate of the cost of the slow rollout amounting to $2.3 trillion.
The world was woefully unprepared for a pandemic, and this is reflected in the challenges COVAX has faced. By the time initial funding arrived, wealthy countries had already locked up early vaccine supplies.
Export bans affecting key suppliers, and difficulties experienced by many manufacturers in scaling up production to the required level, also undermined COVAX’s ability to access doses early.
Given increasing global vaccine inequity and the rise of new, more contagious coronavirus variants, we must put these challenges behind us.
Thanks to the support of almost all G20 governments, alongside that of foundations and private businesses, COVAX has now raised nearly $10 billion and secured more than 600 million donated doses.
All the preparations are in place for the most comprehensive vaccination effort that the world has seen.
Based on the committed orders COVAX has placed with vaccine manufacturers and the additional donations, hundreds of millions of new doses should now be available each month.
We need to make sure they reach poorer countries and get into people’s arms.
To avoid further delays, and for the facility to succeed, we need support from G20 leaders in four key areas.
First, we need doses, and we need them now.
The premise of COVAX was always that the facility should be able to negotiate and buy its own doses.
With our early vaccine access compromised, donations have played a vital role in maintaining our ability to keep doses flowing to those most in need.
Of the 600 million doses pledged to COVAX to date, 100 million have now been delivered.
We need more, and soon, with longer shelf lives and greater certainty so that recipient countries have time to plan their rollout.
This can be achieved without jeopardizing high-income countries’ national vaccination efforts.
We also need G20 leaders to support our call for transparency. COVAX has legally binding agreements with manufacturers for more than four billion doses, but has all too often faced delays in accessing them.
Without greater clarity regarding firms’ order books, it is impossible to know whether these holdups are due to production challenges or preferential treatment for bilateral arrangements.
Insisting that manufacturers are transparent about their order timelines can ensure a level playing field where no one – particularly those living in developing countries – gets bumped to the back of the vaccine queue because of another bilateral deal.
In addition to ensuring that manufacturers keep their commitment to COVAX, governments should make global vaccine access their highest priority.
Countries with pending orders for doses that they currently do not need should allow COVAX to take their place in the queue so that we can get doses to needy countries now.
Finally, lower-income countries require continued financial and technical support for their COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.
Strengthening national health systems will help these countries to ensure delivery of doses and mitigate the pandemic’s secondary effects, and will leave in place infrastructure critical to future global health security.
By recommitting to COVAX, G20 leaders will recommit to a multilateral solution that builds on the astounding scientific progress of the past year.
Based on COVAX’s latest forthcoming supply forecast, when topped up with doses through bilateral deals, equitable COVID-19 vaccine access can protect up to 60% of the adult population in 91 lower-income countries.
This would represent a huge step toward the WHO target of 70%, which is needed to suppress the coronavirus everywhere, and COVAX represents the best opportunity to achieve it.
Failure would mean more lives lost, broken health-care systems, even deadlier and more transmissible variants, and a pandemic with no end in sight.
The G20 must not allow that to be an option.

Optimism for the New Year
NEW YORK – The year 2020 was a harrowing one, with the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide economic reversals, widespread climate-related disasters, pervasive social unrest, and even US President Donald Trump’s phony claims about massive electoral fraud and calls among his backers for martial law.
Yet, despite the grim news, the year also brought some powerful reasons for optimism.
In the coming year, we can lay the foundations for a new era of sustainable development, peace, and cooperation.
The first reason for optimism was the success of many countries in suppressing COVID-19.
Countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region, as varied culturally and politically as Australia, China, South Korea, Laos, New Zealand, and Vietnam, deployed effective public health strategies to contain the pandemic.
So, too, did some countries in other regions, including in Sub-Saharan Africa.
While the headlines were dominated by the disastrous shortcomings of the pandemic response in the United States and Europe, the successes in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere show us how the combination of good governance, a responsible citizenry, and evidence-based policies can solve big and urgent challenges.
The second reason for optimism is the arrival of new vaccines, which are not only a source of great hope for saving lives and stopping the virus, but also a sign of the power of modern science to deliver technological breakthroughs in record time. The vaccine development exemplified the “mission approach” of targeting research and development in a public-private effort.
The same mission approach should be deployed to address other global challenges, such as boosting renewable energy, sustainable farming, and the conservation of biodiversity.
The third reason for optimism is that Trump was decisively defeated in the November election.
Like many demagogues of the past and present, Trump was able to generate a broad public following with the backing of mass propaganda, especially Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News. Yet enough of the public saw through the lies and smears to enable the US to make a new start after Trump’s disastrous reign of ineptitude, hatred, and lies.
Trump’s ignorance and lying contributed to more than 330,000 US deaths from COVID-19 in 2020, roughly one-quarter of the world’s deaths from the virus, though the US accounts for only 4% of the world’s population.
Trump’s disastrous mishandling of COVID-19 ultimately led to his election defeat, yet even then Trump tried to maintain power by making desperate and delusional claims about widespread voter fraud.
Fortunately, both the public and US institutions – mayors, governors, state legislatures, courts, and the military – resisted Trump’s authoritarian impulses, so that President-elect Joe Biden, a decent, honorable, and rational man, will soon be inaugurated.
The fourth reason for optimism is the United Nations’ strong performance, despite the powerful headwinds in 2020.
The UN was ushered into existence 75 years ago by America’s greatest president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as a bulwark against future wars.
It defends the three pillars of multilateralism: peace, human rights, and sustainable development.
In 2020, it performed admirably on all three fronts, despite the provocations from the Trump administration.
The UN agencies today are led by men and women of great skill and integrity, and Secretary-General António Guterres has guided the organization with enormous skill and vision during the toughest year since it was founded. In 2021, the UN will host several crucial global gatherings – on oceans, biodiversity, foods systems, and climate – that together can lay the foundations for decades of global cooperation on sustainable development.
The fifth reason for optimism is the digital revolution, the leading unspoken protagonist of the global pandemic response.
Online activities kept the world functioning.
Within weeks, businesses, schools, finance, government, commerce, payments, health-care providers, and the UN system went online at a rate, scope, and depth unimaginable until that point. The digital technologies played a direct role in fighting the epidemic, providing information, monitoring disease transmission patterns, and providing multiple health-system services.
Obviously, the new digital world has not been an unalloyed paradise.
Distressingly, half the world still lacks Internet access.
As a result, the rapid shift of work, school, social life, commerce, and entertainment to online platforms fueled dramatic inequalities between the Internet haves and have-nots. Moreover, digital technologies have given rise to other new and serious social ills, including large-scale hacking, fake news, cyberwarfare, and unwarranted surveillance by governments and private companies.
The two faces of the digital age, positive and negative, exemplify the situation we face on many fronts.
We can be optimistic knowing that the world’s cutting-edge technologies and scientific knowledge empower us to solve pressing global problems.
Yet we must also be vigilant to stop the forces of greed, ignorance, and hatred from hijacking the new technologies for their ulterior purposes.
The ancient Greek philosophers believed that politics and ethics must go hand in hand.
Aristotle wrote two of his masterworks, the Nicomachean Ethics and The Politics, as companion studies, the first as a guide to human happiness and the latter as a guide to how politics can promote happiness in the Greek city-state (the polis).
In our time, Pope Francis has presented two great encyclicals, Laudato si’ in 2015 and Fratelli tutti in 2020, to show how ethics can help guide the world to environmental sustainability and global peace.
The new encyclical offers a profound description of how we can reach beyond our own families, communities, and countries to build dialogue and trust around the world.
So, let us enter 2021 with real yet cautious optimism.
Let us resolve to extend the public-health successes of the Asia-Pacific region and the new vaccines developed in the US, Europe, Russia, and China to benefit the entire world.
Let us resolve to set aside the hatreds that have undermined global cooperation, and join forces to overcome the inequality, poverty, exclusion, and environmental destruction that threatens the world.
Let us redouble our support for the UN, to build a future based on peace, human rights, and sustainable development. And for those in the US, let us begin to heal a wounded and divided nation.

Forward Guidance for Sanctions on Russian Energy
PRINCETON/PARIS – Russia’s brutal shelling of Ukrainian cities continues. Thousands are dying, millions are suffering.
Yet the West remains paralyzed about further action on what matters most: sanctions on Russian energy exports.
Absent an immediate and full boycott of Russian gas and oil by Western countries, the best way forward is to commit to a ladder of sanctions that they will climb in a preannounced fashion over the coming weeks.
The initial response of the West to the Russian invasion was swift, strong, and impressively unified.
But it is becoming glaringly obvious that it is also insufficient.
The effects of the initial sanctions shock on the Russian economy are fading.
In recent days, the ruble’s exchange rate first stabilized and then appreciated sharply, while government bond yields have fallen back.
The consensus forecast for Russia GDP growth in 2022 stands at -8% – a sharp contraction, but hardly a collapse.
It is not hard to understand why the Russian economy and President Vladimir Putin’s regime have been able to withstand the sanctions so far.
Energy exports – a crucial source of income for the Russian state – remain excluded from the sanctions list.
In fact, surging energy prices have brought massive windfall gains to the Kremlin.
In February, as Russia prepared and launched its invasion, the country’s current account posted its highest monthly surplus in 15 years.
With higher prices and increased flows, the European contribution to Putin’s war chest has increased significantly since the war started.
Huge sums – on the order of €700 million ($769 million) – are transferred to Russian accounts every day.
This money pays for mercenaries, missiles, and aircraft spare parts from countries that sell only for hard currency.
More broadly, about 40% of Russia’s total government budget revenue comes from oil and gas.
Without this income, Putin would struggle to pay for his war machine.
Unfortunately, the debate on an expanded energy embargo seems stuck.
Although academic studies suggest that the economic consequences for energy-importing countries would be manageable, a few key governments remain hesitant. In Germany, for example, the domestic industrial lobby firmly opposes action and, despite generally supportive public opinion, has the government’s ear.
This is highly problematic for at least three reasons.
First, by shying away from economically costly sanctions, European politicians are signaling to Putin that he wields power over Europe, which will only embolden him to test Europe’s resolve even more. It also risks delaying the inevitable adjustment of European industry and consumers to the reality that Russian energy was never as cheap as it seemed.
Lastly, the continued flow of blood-soaked energy money allows Putin to press ahead, dramatically increasing the long-term costs for Europe of containing a revisionist Russia.
At the same time, there is no denying political reality.
However shortsighted their rationale may be, important countries are unwilling to go cold turkey on Russian gas.
To break the deadlock, a preannounced embargo schedule could be implemented over a period of, say, six weeks.
For example, the EU could immediately ban imports of Russian refined oil products, other than diesel, and at the same time announce that the ban will be expanded every week to a new group of products: coal imports next, then diesel, then seaborne crude oil, then pipeline oil.
Finally, about six weeks from now, payment for gas imports would be made into escrow accounts from which withdrawals are frozen for the duration of the war.
Committing to a future path for sanctions that ratchets up the restrictions according to a preannounced schedule would renew pressure on Putin and strengthen incentives to seek diplomatic solutions.
An immediate end to the targeting of civilians and a withdrawal of Russian forces would halt the sanction schedule.
Moreover, “forward guidance” on sanctions would provide European consumers of Russian energy with clarity on the necessary adjustment they will need to make, and its speed.
This would spur efforts to adjust consumption, instead of lobbying politicians in Berlin and other capitals to delay the inevitable.
By forcing industry to make these adjustments, forward guidance on sanctions would also dramatically reduce the vulnerability of the European economy to political extortion by Putin come the fall.
The effectiveness of this policy depends on adhering to certain key design principles.
Most important, such sanctions will need to have an indefinite duration, to avoid the usual EU political gridlock that otherwise may plague efforts to extend them.
If unanimity was needed to abort the tightening of sanctions, the policy would become more credible and defection-proof.
And companies should be able to import Russian energy products only at the current run rate until the full embargo hits.
They would not be allowed to increase imports to front-run the embargo.
The precise ordering of the steps and their detailed breakdown can be decided on the basis of expert analysis of refinery operations, with the aim of minimizing short-run logistical costs for Europe.
The task now is to agree to a graduated schedule of sanctions on Russian energy exports.
Time is not on Europe’s side.
It has been a month since Russia invaded Ukraine.
The longer the deadlock on energy sanctions continues, the likelier Russia will be to have the financial wherewithal to fight the West to the last Ukrainian.

Global Capital Heads for the Frontier
PRINCETON – So-called “frontier market economies" are the latest fad in investment circles.
Though these low-income countries – including Bangladesh and Vietnam in Asia, Honduras and Bolivia in Latin America, and Kenya and Ghana in Africa – have small, undeveloped financial markets, they are growing rapidly and are expected to become the emerging economies of the future.
In the last four years, inflows of private capital into frontier economies have been nearly 50% higher (relative to GDP) than flows into emerging market economies. Whether that should be cheered or lamented is a question that has become a kind of Rorschach test for economic analysts and policymakers.
We now know that the promise of free capital mobility has not been redeemed.
By and large, the surge in capital inflows has boosted consumption rather than investment in recipient countries, exacerbating economic volatility and making painful financial crises more frequent.
Rather than exerting discipline, global financial markets have increased the availability of debt, thereby weakening profligate governments' budget constraints and over-extended banks' balance sheets.
The best argument for free capital mobility remains the one made nearly two decades ago by Stanley Fischer, then the International Monetary Fund's number two official and now Vice Chair of the US Federal Reserve.
Though Fischer recognized the perils of free-flowing capital, he argued that the solution was not to maintain capital controls, but to undertake the reforms required to mitigate the dangers.
Fischer made this argument at a time when the IMF was actively seeking to enshrine capital-account liberalization in its charter.
But then the world witnessed financial crises in Asia, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, and eventually Europe and America.
To its credit, the Fund has since softened its line on capital controls.
In 2010, it issued a note that recognized capital controls as part of the arsenal of policy tools used to combat financial instability.
Nonetheless, at the IMF and in advanced countries, the prevailing view remains that capital controls are a last resort – to be used only after conventional macroeconomic and financial policies have been exhausted.
Free capital mobility continues to be the ultimate goal, even if some countries may have to take their time getting there.
There are two problems with this view.
First, as advocates of capital mobility tirelessly point out, countries must fulfill a long list of prerequisites before they can benefit from financial globalization.
These include the protection of property rights, effective contract enforcement, eradication of corruption, enhanced transparency and financial information, sound corporate governance, monetary and fiscal stability, debt sustainability, market-determined exchange rates, high-quality financial regulation, and prudential supervision. In other words, a policy aimed at enabling growth in developing countries requires first-world institutions before it can work.
Worse, the list is not only long; it is also open ended.
As the advanced countries' experience with the global financial crisis has demonstrated, even the most sophisticated regulatory and supervisory systems are far from being failsafe.
Thus, demanding that developing countries build the kind of institutions that will render capital flows safe not only puts the cart before the horse; it is also a fool's errand.
Caution dictates a more pragmatic approach, one that recognizes a permanent role for capital controls alongside other regulatory and prudential tools.
The second problem concerns the possibility that capital inflows may be harmful to growth, even if we leave aside concerns about financial fragility.
Advocates of capital mobility assume that poor economies have lots of profitable investment opportunities that are not being exploited because of a shortage of investible funds.
Let capital come in, they argue, and investment and growth will take off.
But many developing countries are constrained by a lack of investment demand, not a shortage of domestic saving.
The social return on investment may be high, but private returns are low, owing to externalities, high taxes, poor institutions, or any of a wide array of other factors.
Capital inflows in economies that suffer from low investment demand fuel consumption, not capital accumulation.
They also fuel exchange-rate appreciation, which aggravates the investment shortage.
The profitability of tradable industries – those most likely to suffer from appropriability problems – takes a hit, and investment demand falls further.
In these economies, capital inflows may well retard growth rather than stimulate it.
Such concerns have led emerging economies to experiment with a variety of capital controls.
In principle, frontier market economies can learn much from this experience.
As the Johns Hopkins University economist Olivier Jeanne pointed out at a recent IMF conference organized to spur such learning, the capital-flow measures that have become fashionable of late do not work very well.
That is not because they fail to affect the quantity or composition of flows, but because such effects are quite small.
As Brazil, Colombia, South Korea, and others have learned, limited controls that target specific markets such as bonds or short-term bank lending do not have a significant impact on key outcomes – the exchange rate, monetary independence, or domestic financial stability. The implication is that capital controls may need to be blunt and comprehensive, rather than surgical and targeted, to be truly effective.
Capital controls by themselves are no panacea, and they often create worse problems, such as corruption or a delay in needed reforms, than they solve.
But this is no different from any other area of government action.
We live in a second-best world where policy action is almost always partial (and partially effective), and well-intentioned reforms in one area may backfire in the presence of distortions elsewhere in the system.
In such a world, treating capital controls as the last resort, always and everywhere, has little rationale; indeed, it merely fetishizes financial globalization.
The world needs case-by-case, hardheaded pragmatism, recognizing that capital controls sometimes deserve a prominent place.

Exorcising the Last Balkan Ghosts
The next few weeks will see the resolution, one way or another, of the last territorial issues remaining in the Balkans, where the wars of the 1990’s ended with NATO interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999).
Even with peace, major problems were left unresolved.
Bosnia was divided between a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic, with little authority vested in the central government and a large international military – and eventually civilian – presence needed to hold it together.
Kosovo was left as a United Nations protectorate whose “final status” was uncertain.
These unresolved issues are now returning: prompted by Serbia’s government, Bosnia’s Serb leadership is contemplating secession, even as its Muslim leadership tries to increase central control.
And Kosovo’s Albanian population is clamoring for independence, while Serbia tries to postpone a decision by blocking action in the Security Council.
There is a real risk of renewed violence, though perhaps not on the scale of the 1990’s. If the current negotiations on Kosovo’s status fail, Albanian extremists will seek to expel the more than 100,000 Serbs who live there.
Similarly, any move by Bosnia’s Serb Republic to secede could incite instability there.
Serbia, which traded violent nationalism for nonviolent nationalism when Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown eight years ago, has done all it can to impede resolution of these issues, with strong support from Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
Serbia wants as much independence as possible for the Serb Republic, while asserting its own sovereignty over Kosovo.
Serbs governed only by Serbs on their own territory is still Serbia’s goal.
The United States and the European Union are committed to a different vision: democratic transition and integration of all of the Balkans into NATO and eventually the EU. But they have been reluctant to impose conditions on Serbia, for fear of bringing even more radical nationalists to power.
The US allowed Serbia into NATO’s Partnership for Peace, despite Serbia’s refusal to extradite General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs’ military leader in the 1990’s, to The Hague to face war crimes charges.
The EU has negotiated and initialed (but not yet signed) a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia, despite its recalcitrance in the Kosovo negotiations and meddling in Bosnia.
But appeasement has failed.
The US and the EU must use the strong hand that they still hold to ensure that their vision prevails, bringing lasting peace to a region that has repeatedly dragged great powers into conflict.
This requires, above all, a stiff warning to Serbia that it can no longer prevent Bosnia and Kosovo from moving towards Europe.
If for now a democratic Serbia prefers radical nationalism and alignment with Russia to membership in the EU and NATO, so be it.
No vital US interests are at stake, and Serbia will soon recognize its mistake.
The EU should be relieved not to admit such a Serbia.
At the same time, the US and the EU, acting together, must get serious in Bosnia and Kosovo.
In Bosnia, any further moves to undermine the essential compromise reached in the 1995 Dayton agreement should be met with the full powers of Bosnia’s “high representative,” who has recently negotiated an agreement that will strengthen the country’s fragile governing structure.
Bosnia’s leading Serb and Muslim politicians are playing with fire because they know the fire department is standing by.
It is time to take away their matches.
In Kosovo, now that a last-ditch round of negotiations has concluded with a report to the UN Secretary General, the US and the EU should agree to recognize Kosovo’s independence, provided the Kosovars agree to implement the plan submitted by Finnish mediator Marti Ahtisaari.
The Ahtisaari plan provides ample protection for Serbs and an international presence in Kosovo – which the US and the EU will need to deploy even without a new Security Council resolution – to ensure implementation.
Ironically, Serbia’s resistance to the Ahtisaari plan undermines protection for Kosovo’s Serbs and increases the risk that they will be mistreated.
American officials are fond of pointing out that the US has repeatedly intervened to protect Muslims from war and dictatorship.
But this claim will be devalued if the so far successful international interventions in Bosnia or Kosovo end in tragedy.
A satisfactory outcome in both places is within reach.
To achieve it, the US and the EU must ensure that Serbia is blocked from making trouble, Kosovo becomes independent, and Bosnia stays united.

Europe’s Fiscal Wormhole
BRUSSELS – The International Monetary Fund now estimates a 30% risk of deflation in the eurozone, and growth figures within the monetary union continue to disappoint.
But policymakers seem trapped in a cat’s cradle of economic, political, and legal constraints that is preventing effective action. The fulfillment of policy rules appears to be impossible without growth, but growth appears to be impossible without breaking the rules.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble is politically committed to outdoing his country’s tough domestic fiscal framework to secure what he calls a “black zero” budget.
The French government is working to regain credibility on reform promises made in exchange for delays on fiscal adjustment, and Italy, with one of the highest debt burdens in the eurozone, has little room to use fiscal policy.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is constrained by doubts about the legality of its “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) scheme – sovereign-bond purchases that could result in a redistributive fiscal policy.
With all of the rules pointing toward recession, how can Europe boost recovery?
A two-year €400 billion ($510 billion) public-investment program, financed with European Investment Bank bonds, would be the best way to overcome Europe’s current impasse.
Borrowing by the EIB has no implications in terms of European fiscal rules.
It is recorded neither as new debt nor as a deficit for any of the member states, which means that new government spending could be funded without affecting national fiscal performance.
Thus, some of the investment spending currently planned at the national level could be financed via European borrowing to relieve national budgets.
Such an indirect way of dealing with strict rules would also be easier than starting long and wearying negotiations on changes to the fiscal framework.
The EIB is worried that such a scheme could come at the cost of its triple-A rating.
Indeed, though it can currently borrow at 1.6% on a long maturity, it has used its recent capital-raising exercise to reduce leverage rather than substantially increase its loan portfolio, as would be warranted at a time of retrenchment in private lending. In any case, a rating change would hardly affect funding costs in the current low-yield environment, as lower-rated sovereigns have demonstrated.
In addition, the ECB could purchase EIB bonds on secondary markets, which would help to keep funding costs low – or even reduce them.
More important, purchases of EIB bonds would enable the ECB to undertake quantitative easing without triggering the degree of controversy implied by intervening in 18 separate sovereign-bond markets, where concerns that ECB purchases would affect the relative pricing of sovereigns are very real.
Already, €200 billion of EIB bonds are available.
Adding €400 billion would increase the pool substantially.
Together with asset-backed securities, covered bonds, and corporate bonds, €1 trillion of assets – the threshold widely thought to make quantitative easing by the ECB credible – would be available for purchase.
A central question, of course, concerns the type of government spending that should qualify as investment spending, and which European investment projects should be supported.
It will be impossible to define new and sensible European projects worth €200 billion per year.
Common projects such as the European energy union will need more time to be precisely defined.
As a result, the bulk of investment now will have to come from national policymakers.
In part, this means that existing infrastructure projects that are supposed to be financed from national budgets could be funded by the EIB.
By removing some of the burden from national budgets, the current decline in public investment could be reversed.
Some of the new resources could also be used to allow for budget consolidation in France without pro-cyclical cuts.
France could get this helping hand in complying with the fiscal rules in exchange for serious and necessary structural reforms, as could Italy, where EIB-funded bonds would provide a much-needed growth stimulus without new government commitments.
In Germany, the freed-up resources could be used to accelerate existing investment projects while still meeting its black-zero pledge.
Similar arrangements could be found for the other eurozone countries.
To prevent the misuse of money, the European Commission should vet all national investment projects.
More broadly, the program would be an important step toward establishing the eurozone’s missing fiscal union.
That goal will be reached more quickly once the benefits of achieving it are apparent to all.

America’s Unholy Crusade Against China
NEW YORK – Many white Christian evangelicals in the United States have long believed that America has a God-given mission to save the world.
Under the influence of this crusading mentality, US foreign policy has often swerved from diplomacy to war.
It is in danger of doing so again.
Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched yet another evangelical crusade, this time against China.
His speech was extremist, simplistic, and dangerous – and may well put the US on a path to conflict with China.
According to Pompeo, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China (CPC) harbor a “decades-long desire for global hegemony.”
This is ironic.
Only one country – the US – has a defense strategy calling for it to be the “preeminent military power in the world,” with “favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere.” China’s defense white paper, by contrast, states that “China will never follow the beaten track of big powers in seeking hegemony,” and that, “As economic globalization, the information society, and cultural diversification develop in an increasingly multi-polar world, peace, development, and win-win cooperation remain the irreversible trends of the times.”
One is reminded of Jesus’s own admonition: “Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye” (Matthew 7:5).
US military spending totaled $732 billion in 2019, nearly three times the $261 billion China spent.
The US, moreover, has around 800 overseas military bases, while China has just one (a small naval base in Djibouti).
The US has many military bases close to China, which has none anywhere near the US.
The US has 5,800 nuclear warheads; China has roughly 320.
The US has 11 aircraft carriers; China has one.
The US has launched many overseas wars in the past 40 years; China has launched none (though it has been criticized for border skirmishes, most recently with India, that stop short of war).
The US has repeatedly rejected or withdrawn from United Nations treaties and UN organizations in recent years, including UNESCO, the Paris climate agreement, and, most recently, the World Health Organization, while China supports UN processes and agencies.
US President Donald Trump recently threatened the staff of the International Criminal Court with sanctions.
Pompeo rails against China’s clampdown on its mainly Muslim Uighur population, but Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, claims that Trump privately gave China’s actions a pass, or even encouraged them.
The world took relatively little notice of Pompeo’s speech, which offered no evidence to back up his claims of China’s hegemonic ambition.
China’s rejection of US hegemony does not mean that China itself seeks hegemony.
Indeed, outside of the US, there is little belief that China aims for global dominance.
China’s explicitly stated national goals are to be a “moderately prosperous society” by 2021 (the centenary of the CPC), and a “fully developed country” by 2049 (the centennial of the People’s Republic).
Moreover, at an estimated $10,098 in 2019, China’s GDP per capita was less than one-sixth that of the US ($65,112) – hardly the basis for global supremacy.
China still has a lot of catching up to do to achieve even its basic economic development goals.
Assuming that Trump loses in November’s presidential election, Pompeo’s speech will likely receive no further notice.
The Democrats will surely criticize China, but without Pompeo’s brazen exaggerations.
Yet, if Trump wins, Pompeo’s speech could be a harbinger of chaos.
Pompeo’s evangelism is real, and white evangelicals are the political base of today’s Republican Party.
Pompeo’s zealous excesses have deep roots in American history.
As I recounted in my recent book A New Foreign Policy, English protestant settlers believed that they were founding a New Israel in the new promised land, with God’s providential blessings.
In 1845, John O’Sullivan coined the phrase “Manifest Destiny” to justify and celebrate America’s violent annexation of North America.
“All this will be our future history,” he wrote in 1839, “to establish on earth the moral dignity and salvation of man – the immutable truth and beneficence of God. For this blessed mission to the nations of the world, which are shut out from the life-giving light of truth, has America been chosen...”
On the basis of such exalted views of its own beneficence, the US engaged in mass enslavement until the Civil War and mass apartheid thereafter; slaughtered Native Americans throughout the nineteenth century and subjugated them thereafter; and, with the closure of the Western frontier, extended Manifest Destiny overseas.
Later, with the onset of the Cold War, anti-communist fervor led the US to fight disastrous wars in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) in the 1960s and 1970s, and brutal wars in Central America in the 1980s.
After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the evangelical ardor was directed against “radical Islam” or “Islamic fascism,” with four US wars of choice – in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya – all of which remain debacles to this day.
Suddenly, the supposed existential threat of radical Islam has been forgotten, and the new crusade targets the CPC.
Pompeo himself is a biblical literalist who believes that the end time, the apocalyptic battle between good and evil, is imminent.
Pompeo described his beliefs in a 2015 speech while a Congressman from Kansas: America is a Judeo-Christian nation, the greatest in history, whose task is to fight God’s battles until the Rapture, when Christ’s born-again followers, like Pompeo, will be swept to heaven at the Last Judgment.
White evangelicals represent only around 17% of the US adult population, but comprise around 26% of voters. They vote overwhelmingly Republican (an estimated 81% in 2016), making them the party’s single most important voting bloc.
That gives them powerful influence on Republican policy, and in particular on foreign policy when Republicans control the White House and Senate (with its treaty-ratifying powers).
Fully 99% of Republican congressmen are Christian, of whom around 70% are Protestant, including a significant though unknown proportion of evangelicals.
Of course, the Democrats also harbor some politicians who proclaim American exceptionalism and launch crusading wars (for example, President Barack Obama’s interventions in Syria and Libya).
On the whole, however, the Democratic Party is less wedded to claims of US hegemony than is the Republican Party’s evangelical base.
Pompeo’s inflammatory anti-China rhetoric could become even more apocalyptic in the coming weeks, if only to fire up the Republican base ahead of the election. If Trump is defeated, as seems likely, the risk of a US confrontation with China will recede.
But if he remains in power, whether by a true electoral victory, vote fraud, or even a coup (anything is possible), Pompeo’s crusade would probably proceed, and could well bring the world to the brink of a war that he expects and perhaps even seeks.

Ensuring Cybersecurity for Critical Civilian Infrastructure
STANFORD – The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that nurses, doctors, and other health-care workers not only play an essential role in keeping us safe and healthy, but also sometimes must risk their own lives and health to do so.
Throughout the crisis, they have rightly been applauded for their sacrifices.
But to ensure that they are fully supported in doing their jobs, we also must recognize the importance of the technologies that underpin the modern health-care system.
We don’t have to applaud software, but we do need to ensure that it is resilient against external threats.
Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting vulnerable communities, and health-care workers are no exception.
In addition to the challenges they face working overtime to help COVID-19 patients, they also must confront ruthless cyberattacks, just when they have the least bandwidth to defend themselves. Using both large-scale ransomware campaigns and highly sophisticated targeting techniques, hackers are singling out hospitals, medical facilities, and vaccine laboratories.
Over the past two months, such attacks have occurred every three days.
We must do more to protect vulnerable communities wherever they are under attack, understand attackers’ motives and methods, and push for better legal protections and more responsible behavior online.
If criminals or hostile states were threatening health-care workers with physical weapons, the outcry would be immediate and deafening.
So why have we not seen a similar reaction to these cyberattacks?
Part of the problem is that we are still playing catch-up.
Earlier incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks in 2017 did not prompt the serious collective response that they should have.
In addition, the flood of disinformation – an “infodemic” – during the pandemic has compounded the threat.
According to the World Health Organization, during a pandemic, an infodemic can be just as dangerous as the virus itself.
But, beyond sector-specific threats, cyberspace also suffers from broader, longstanding problems of accountability.
There is a persistent lack of consistency in how international law is applied and enforced.
Many countries have a deep digital divide in technical capacity, and have failed to put human rights at the center of cybersecurity discussions.
It is time to patch these holes, so that we can replace scattershot responses with a systematic and collective approach.
The pandemic has underscored how much all of us – governments, businesses, and ordinary citizens – depend on cyberspace.
As a public good, cyberspace should be safe and reliable; and because it is a shared resource, we have a shared responsibility to protect it.
As digital citizens, we can all contribute to this broader effort.
Individual behavior – such as exercising greater caution when opening attachments or forwarding emails (which may contain disinformation or malicious code) – can make a significant difference.
At the same time, cybersecurity experts can have a major impact by pledging time and resources to help health-care professionals combat the latest wave of attacks.
Civil-society groups, academics, and the news media can raise awareness about the victims of attacks and the methods used. And businesses can do more to take responsibility as global players, including by ensuring that their supply chains are secure.
Governments are in a unique position to protect health care and other critical sectors from cyberattacks. Through diplomatic, intelligence, and law-enforcement channels, governments have powerful and sophisticated tools to determine the sources and methods of attacks.
Perhaps most importantly, under existing laws and norms, governments have obligations not only to refrain from carrying out or supporting such attacks, but also to ensure that critical sectors are adequately prepared and protected.
Last month, the CyberPeace Institute joined others around the world in calling on governments to embrace these commitments fully.
Now more than ever, policymakers and state institutions must use their singular capabilities to protect vulnerable communities and sectors, and to hold those who perpetrate cyberattacks accountable. Governments must invest the time, energy, money, diplomacy, and other resources needed to protect the infrastructure and systems upon which modern economic, political, and civilian life depends.
To aid in the effort, the CyberPeace Institute and other organizations have launched Cyber 4 Healthcare, a targeted service to connect health workers and organizations with qualified and reputable companies offering volunteer cybersecurity assistance.
But that is only the beginning.
In addition to protecting health workers, we need to find ways to assist other critical civilian infrastructure sectors.
That means extending support to vulnerable groups when they need it, holding governments and other stakeholders accountable to their commitments, and sharing information widely in order to inform law-enforcement agencies and policymakers.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest global crisis to highlight the need for a more stable and secure cyberspace for all.
It certainly won’t be the last.
Fortunately, when it comes to cyberattacks, we already have a cure.
It is time to start administering it.

Insuring Against Insurance
NEW HAVEN -- Most people who save and invest do so for their entire lives.
But most of the institutions upon which they rely for their investments and savings are geared to the short term.
This mismatch causes fundamental problems.
An excellent example is homeowners’ insurance.
Almost universally in the world today, homeowners’ insurance is short term.
Typically, it is renewed annually, which means that it does not cover the risk that insurance companies will raise rates at any future renewal date.
Yet we have seen major changes recently in homeowners’ insurance rates.
For example, the average homeowner premium in Florida soared from $723 at the start of 2002 to $1,465 in the first quarter of 2007.
Such rapid increases represent a risk that is on the same order of magnitude as many of the damage risks that the policies are supposed to address.
In a study presented in early May at America’s National Bureau of Economic Research, the economists Dwight Jaffee, Howard Kunreuther, and Erwann Michel-Kerjan called for a fundamental change in policy aimed at developing true long-term insurance (LTI) that set insurance premiums for many years.
Unless we do that, homeowners are unsure from year to year whether their insurance policies will be canceled or that their premiums will skyrocket unexpectedly as they have in coastal regions of Florida where there is hurricane and flood risk. As the authors point out, for insurers to even consider a long term policy they must have the freedom to charge premiums that reflects risk.
Urbanization itself is also a source of risk, as evidenced by the recent earthquake in China, which has cost at least tens of thousands of lives.
Moreover, global warming appears to be increasing the intensity of storms.
Some scientists attribute the intensity of Cyclone Nargis, which struck Myanmar, killing more than 30,000, to global warming.
Of course, we do not know for sure that these risks will mean higher insured losses in the future.
Population growth in coastal areas may not continue to imply more risk exposure, since choice lots may already be getting somewhat more scarce, and further development may favor more central areas.
And urbanization, if done right, leads to better catastrophe planning and stricter construction standards, which might actually reduce risks. In fact, long term insurance may encourage homeowners to invest in risk reducing measures because the premium discounts they will obtain for taking this action will justify incurring the cost of investment.
The course of global warming, and its impact on future storms, is also the subject of considerable uncertainty.
Meteorology is not an exact science, and we cannot predict the precise extent and impact of environmental initiatives, though progress in weather forecasting might also reduce the damage caused by hurricanes.
Data presented by Roger Pielke in the Natural Hazards Review in February shows that actual insured losses caused by the most important hurricanes since 1900 followed a U-shaped curve. The most damaging hurricanes (scaled for the size of the economy) to hit the United States occurred both in the early twentieth century and most recently – the worst being the 1926 hurricane that struck Miami, Florida.
Just as no one anticipated this U-shaped pattern of losses, so future losses must remain essentially unknown.
This means that the problem is not a certain increase in homeowners’ insurance losses, but rather a risk of increase.
Paradoxically, that is a good thing, because it means that risk-management technology can be used to mitigate the problem.
To see why, consider health or life insurance.
If genetic information ever enables an exact prediction of each individual’s ultimate date of illness and death, that information, if commonly available, would make such insurance impossible to get (no one would insure someone about whom it is known that he will suffer from the harm to be insured against). It is just the same with homeowners’ insurance: because the risk of losses is uncertain, it can be sold by those who feel most concerned about it to others who can better bear it.
Insurance regulators are certainly well aware of the risk of future increases in homeowners’ insurance premiums.
But trying to address these risks by limiting such increases doesn’t work well, because if insurance companies are not making any money, they will withdraw from the market.
Nor can this problem be solved by imposing fees on insurance companies that withdraw from the market in response to premium caps, because the companies will eventually learn to consider the possibility of such fees even before entering an insurance market.
Sometimes, governments have become directly involved in providing insurance.
In the US, for example, Florida’s state legislature created the Citizens’ Property Insurance Corporation in 2002.
But replacing private insurance with government insurance plans is far from optimal.
Like other forms of saving and investment, it is better that insurance be allocated by a market, rather than in a political arena.
The beauty of the LTI plan proposed by Jaffee, Kunreuther, and Michel-Kerjan is that it would allow market forces to determine long-term (20 years or more) insurance premiums.
The premiums would be set so that there would be no reason for insurance companies to withdraw from the market in response to greater risk.
Homeowners can rest assured that they can continue to insure their property at known rates.
Moreover, the premiums would provide price signals that would guide new construction.
In areas where scientists think that there is a likelihood that greater risks will prevail in coming years, high insurance premiums would provide a market incentive to curtail development.
Everyone would end up better off.

What Italy’s Election Means for the EU
ROME – Italy’s recent election – in which voters rebuffed traditional parties in favor of anti-establishment and far-right movements, producing a hung parliament – should serve as a wake-up call for Europe.
The decades-old project of building European unity may not just be far less robust than assumed; without a significant rethink, it may not even be viable.
The financial crisis of 2008 and the debt crisis that followed revealed major flaws in the governance of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
Member states responded by building new institutions, such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the European Stability Mechanism.
These efforts are, however, almost certainly inadequate to make the EMU resilient enough to withstand future financial crises.
Anyone who believes in the European project should hope that further reforms follow soon.
But there is an even more urgent task at hand.
The European Union (EU) and the EMU, in particular, are now facing a serious political challenge, exemplified by Italy’s recent election.
Are European institutions strong enough to confront that challenge, or must we reconsider – and potentially recast – the pillars of European cooperation?
The link between economic and political crises is well known.
Among EU countries, Italy has experienced the second-largest decline in output (after Greece) during the last decade – a trend that caused a significant deterioration in economic welfare.
And, as recent research indicates, a decline in welfare correlates more strongly with political support for populists than its absolute level.
In this sense, economic crises are almost bound to undermine political stability.
But the risk is particularly acute in the EU, because populist political forces, should they win power, are likely to reject, in the name of national sovereignty, the supranational rules that form the basis of European institutions.
In the face of such noncompliance, the EU’s only recourse is sanctions – a temporary solution that is inadequate to keep in check governments that have based their political platforms on disavowing common EU rules.
In fact, such sanctions can even serve to strengthen public support for the populists.
This dynamic is illustrated by the current row over immigration between the EU and some of its eastern members, such as Hungary and Poland.
Of course, if the rules being broken are fiscal, the markets might impose the necessary discipline, as happened in 2011-2012.
But today, the ongoing economic recovery – and the fact that governments and central banks hold the majority of countries’ debts – makes such a market response far from guaranteed.
Complicating matters further for the EU are regional disparities, like those starkly on display in Italy’s recent election.
While anti-establishment political parties did well across Italy, reflecting broad frustration with the mainstream parties, there was also a distinct north/south divide.
Italy’s industrial north favored the far-right League party, which favors tax cuts and opposes immigration.
By contrast, Italy’s economically deprived southern regions – where youth unemployment has, in some areas, reached nearly 60% – voted overwhelmingly for the Five Star Movement, which advocates a guaranteed basic income and condemns the corruption of local elites.
Regional inequalities are not limited to Italy.
On the contrary, they have increased throughout the EU since the 1980s.
And the EU does have a budget for reducing them, which it uses to support its cohesion policies.
But while measures encouraging economic convergence have been successful in many jurisdictions, they have failed in others, such as southern Italy, precisely because of the institutional weakness and widespread corruption that the populists decry.
As anyone with experience in development policy knows, fiscal transfers cannot generate convergence growth, unless they are backed by deep societal changes – and that demands active local leadership.
It is thus significant that Italian voters threw their support behind those who decried the abuse of power by local elites and traditional parties, instead of believing that those local elites, let alone the faraway EU, can fix the problem.
This might seem to imply that the EU needs to be able to impose looser terms of cooperation, including fewer benefits from membership. But while that might work for, say, Hungary, it would be inconceivable for an EMU member like Italy.
In any case, if the EU is to survive long enough to implement the needed institutional reforms, it will to have to find ways to make the project more appealing for all.

What Are Homebuyers Thinking?
Many places around the world have been in a housing boom since the late 1990’s.
As I argued last year, in the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance , the boom is rooted in speculative investment by ordinary homebuyers, fueled substantially by the worldwide perception that capitalism has triumphed, and that all people must look out for themselves by acquiring property. Convinced that private ownership has become essential to smart living, buyers bid up home prices.
Moreover, the fear that one must get in on the boom before it is too late often drives people to bid up home prices faster now.
This certainly seems to be the market psychology in China and India, where rapidly rising incomes and newly successful people are widely expected to put pressure on markets for land, real estate, and construction materials.
Real estate booms have been going on in these countries’ major cities for years.
In China, despite some signs of weakness – the Shanghai market is down, for example – price growth is still robust in much of the country.
But the boom generated by such beliefs cannot go on forever, because prices can’t go up forever, and there are already signs of a hard landing.
In the United States, newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade-long boom in home prices may be at an end, and that the bubble may be bursting.
The psychology has suddenly changed, creating widespread fear of sharp drops in US home prices.
The new futures market for single-family homes at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (which I helped establish last May with our firm MacroMarkets LLC) is predicting that by next August prices will fall between 6% and 8% in all ten US cities traded.
If home prices crash in the US, the bastion of capitalism, could it destroy confidence and end the boom in other countries?
If so, could a worldwide recession follow?
This scenario is a distinct possibility, although there are reasons to be skeptical.
Most importantly, the ultimate sources of the housing boom – the beliefs about capitalism and future economic growth – seem solidly entrenched.
The downward price trend in the US market, for example, does not seem to reflect underlying changes in long-run economic confidence.
The survey that Karl Case and I conducted in May and June of this year, under the auspices of the Yale School of Management, shows sharp declines in short-term expectations for home prices in the US, but relatively little change in long-term expectations.
Most people still believe that housing is a great long-term investment.
Maybe real estate prices are unlikely to fall to pre-boom levels because the fundamental change in perceptions concerning capitalism’s triumph will be longstanding.
Changes in people’s fundamental ways of thinking are not easily reversed.
Nor, therefore, is their interest in housing as a major speculative investment asset likely to change.
The transformation in investors’ beliefs is striking.
Before the real estate boom of the late 1970’s, hardly anyone was worried about rising home prices. A search of old newspapers finds surprisingly few articles about the outlook for home prices.
Those that did appear generally seem to be based on the assumption that minor fluctuations in construction costs, not massive market swings, drove the modest home price movements that they noted.
Indeed, hardly anything interesting about home prices was ever reported at all, aside from an occasional comment in an article about something else.
For example, an article in The Times of London in 1970 argued that rising home prices reflected the switch to a new British Standard Time (imposed as a three-year experiment in 1968 to facilitate commerce with Western Europe by putting Britain in the same time zone).
The article claimed that the change raised costs by forcing British construction workers to perform more of their jobs in relative darkness. Speculative investment behavior was hardly an issue in those rare instances in which home prices were discussed.
To understand the nature of the subsequent shift, consider that it is hard to find anyone today who worries that automobile prices will soar because rising demand in China and India for steel and other materials will push automobile prices out of reach in the future.
Though a small group of collectors invests speculatively in antique or specialty cars, the idea of speculating in automobiles just is not in the public consciousness.
That is how it was with housing until the late 1970’s.
Now that we think differently about real estate, we will never be the same again. But, of course, housing prices can only rise so fast.
High and rapidly rising home prices tend to stimulate new housing supply, which in turn tends to undermine prices.
Over a period of years, as people see how much new supply there is, they may begin to revise their view that homes are such a terrific investment, causing a gradual, but eventually significant, drop in home prices.
Indeed, while changes in fundamental perceptions may not occur easily or fast, they should never be ruled out.
Urban land prices in major Japanese cities have steadily dropped over much of the period since 1991, as the enormous faith in the miraculous powers of Japanese capitalism gradually faded.
The same kind of erosion in home prices could occur in many cities around the world.
All that is required is that growth in housing supply eventually outstrips investors’ faith in capitalism to sustain faster growth in demand.

Redesigning Capitalism
PARIS – When the heads of state of the world’s 20 largest economies come together on short notice, as they just did in Washington, D.C., it is clear how serious the current global crisis is.
They did not decide much, except to call for improved monitoring and regulation of financial flows.
More importantly, they committed themselves to launching a lasting process to reform the world’s financial system.
Of course, those who dreamed of a Bretton Woods II were disappointed.
But the original Bretton Woods framework was not built in a day; indeed, the 1944 conference was preceded by two and a half years of preparatory negotiations, which is probably the minimum needed to decide such weighty issues. The recent G-20 summit occurred with virtually no real preliminary work.
Three tasks must now be addressed.
First, a floor must be put under the international financial system in order to stop its collapse.
Second, new regulations are needed once the system revives, because if it remains the same way, it will only produce new crises.
Finding the right mix will not be easy.
For 25 years, the world has experienced a huge financial crisis every five years, each seemingly with its own cause.
The third task is to focus on real economic activity, end the recession, sustain growth, and, above all, reform the capitalist system to make it be less dependent on finance.
Long-term investments, not short-term profits, and productive work, rather than paper gains, need to be supported.
The first task is already being tackled.
But, although the United States and some European countries have gone a long way toward restoring the lending capacity of banks, that may not be enough.
After all, if the economy is to grow again, banks need borrowers, but the recession has led entrepreneurs to cut their investments.
The second task remains open.
Disagreements about how to re-regulate the financial markets are deep, owing to countless taboos and the huge interests at stake.
Moreover, there can be no comprehensive agreement that does not take into account the relationship between finance and the real economy.
The essential problem in addressing the third task is to find out precisely what is going on in the real economy.
Some states (Iceland and Hungary) are clearly bankrupt.
Some merely face a hazardous financial situation (Denmark, Spain, and others).
Their financial crisis is the main reason for their weakness.
All of these problems are so difficult to resolve because they have been festering for so long.
It is now increasingly evident that today’s crisis has its roots in February 1971, when US President Richard Nixon decided to break the link between the dollar and gold.
Until that point, America’s pledge to maintain the gold standard was the basis for the global fixed-exchange-rate system, which was the heart of the Bretton Woods framework. During the 27 years that it lasted, huge growth in international trade, supported by non-volatile pricing, was the norm, and large financial crises were absent.
Since then, the international financial system has been highly volatile.
The era of floating exchange rates that followed the end of the gold standard required the development of products that could protect international trade from price volatility.
This opened the way to options, selling and buying on credit, and derivatives of all kinds.
These innovations were considered technical successes.
Prices were (mostly) stabilized, but with a slow, if continuous, rising trend.
The market for these financial products grew over 30 years to the point that they delivered huge opportunities for immediate gain, which provided a strong incentive for market participants to play with them more and more.
During this time, capitalism – smooth and successful between 1945-1975 (sustained high growth, low unemployment, and no financial crises) – weakened.
Through pension funds, investment funds, and arbitrage (or hedge) funds, shareholders became well organized and seized power in developed countries’ firms. Under their pressure, more and more processes were “outsourced.”
In real terms, wages no longer rose (indeed, the average real wage has been stagnant for 25 years in the US), and a growing share of manpower (currently around 15%) was without steady employment.
Everywhere, the share of wages and incomes began to fall as a proportion of GDP. As a result, consumption weakened, unsteady employment grew, and unemployment stopped declining.
Under such circumstances, the upper middle classes in developed countries increasingly came to look for capital gains instead of improving their living standards through productive work.
This promoted inequality, and led to the under-regulated financial system’s seizure of power over the entire economy, destabilizing the real economy by fatally weakening its capacity to react to external shocks.
Today’s crisis marks the end of economic growth fueled only by credit.
But untying the knot that an overweening financial sector has drawn around the economy will take time. Indeed, there is still no consensus that this needs to be done.
Yet the G-20 has opened the way to discussion of these fundamental issues.
Today’s recession will be a long one, but it will compel everybody to consider its root causes.

A Greek Morality Tale
NEW YORK – When the euro crisis began a half-decade ago, Keynesian economists predicted that the austerity that was being imposed on Greece and the other crisis countries would fail.
It would stifle growth and increase unemployment – and even fail to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Others – in the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and a few universities – talked of expansionary contractions.
But even the International Monetary Fund argued that contractions, such as cutbacks in government spending, were just that – contractionary.
We hardly needed another test.
Austerity had failed repeatedly, from its early use under US President Herbert Hoover, which turned the stock-market crash into the Great Depression, to the IMF “programs” imposed on East Asia and Latin America in recent decades.
And yet when Greece got into trouble, it was tried again.
Greece largely succeeded in following the dictate set by the “troika” (the European Commission the ECB, and the IMF): it converted a primary budget deficit into a primary surplus.
But the contraction in government spending has been predictably devastating: 25% unemployment, a 22% fall in GDP since 2009, and a 35% increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
And now, with the anti-austerity Syriza party’s overwhelming election victory, Greek voters have declared that they have had enough.
So, what is to be done?
First, let us be clear: Greece could be blamed for its troubles if it were the only country where the troika’s medicine failed miserably.
But Spain had a surplus and a low debt ratio before the crisis, and it, too, is in depression.
What is needed is not structural reform within Greece and Spain so much as structural reform of the eurozone’s design and a fundamental rethinking of the policy frameworks that have resulted in the monetary union’s spectacularly bad performance.
Greece has also once again reminded us of how badly the world needs a debt-restructuring framework.
Excessive debt caused not only the 2008 crisis, but also the East Asia crisis in the 1990s and the Latin American crisis in the 1980s.
It continues to cause untold suffering in the US, where millions of homeowners have lost their homes, and is now threatening millions more in Poland and elsewhere who took out loans in Swiss francs.
Given the amount of distress brought about by excessive debt, one might well ask why individuals and countries have repeatedly put themselves into this situation. After all, such debts are contracts – that is, voluntary agreements – so creditors are just as responsible for them as debtors.
In fact, creditors arguably are more responsible: typically, they are sophisticated financial institutions, whereas borrowers frequently are far less attuned to market vicissitudes and the risks associated with different contractual arrangements.
Indeed, we know that US banks actually preyed on their borrowers, taking advantage of their lack of financial sophistication.
Every (advanced) country has realized that making capitalism work requires giving individuals a fresh start.
The debtors’ prisons of the nineteenth century were a failure – inhumane and not exactly helping to ensure repayment.
What did help was to provide better incentives for good lending, by making creditors more responsible for the consequences of their decisions.
At the international level, we have not yet created an orderly process for giving countries a fresh start.
Since even before the 2008 crisis, the United Nations, with the support of almost all of the developing and emerging countries, has been seeking to create such a framework.
But the US has been adamantly opposed; perhaps it wants to reinstitute debtor prisons for over indebted countries’ officials (if so, space may be opening up at Guantánamo Bay).
The idea of bringing back debtors’ prisons may seem far-fetched, but it resonates with current talk of moral hazard and accountability.
There is a fear that if Greece is allowed to restructure its debt, it will simply get itself into trouble again, as will others.
This is sheer nonsense.
Does anyone in their right mind think that any country would willingly put itself through what Greece has gone through, just to get a free ride from its creditors? If there is a moral hazard, it is on the part of the lenders – especially in the private sector – who have been bailed out repeatedly.
If Europe has allowed these debts to move from the private sector to the public sector – a well-established pattern over the past half-century – it is Europe, not Greece, that should bear the consequences.
Indeed, Greece’s current plight, including the massive run-up in the debt ratio, is largely the fault of the misguided troika programs foisted on it.
So it is not debt restructuring, but its absence, that is “immoral.”
There is nothing particularly special about the dilemmas that Greece faces today; many countries have been in the same position.
What makes Greece’s problems more difficult to address is the structure of the eurozone: monetary union implies that member states cannot devalue their way out of trouble, yet the modicum of European solidarity that must accompany this loss of policy flexibility simply is not there.
Seventy years ago, at the end of World War II, the Allies recognized that Germany must be given a fresh start.
They understood that Hitler’s rise had much to do with the unemployment (not the inflation) that resulted from imposing more debt on Germany at the end of World War I. The Allies did not take into account the foolishness with which the debts had been accumulated or talk about the costs that Germany had imposed on others.
Instead, they not only forgave the debts; they actually provided aid, and the Allied troops stationed in Germany provided a further fiscal stimulus.
When companies go bankrupt, a debt-equity swap is a fair and efficient solution.
The analogous approach for Greece is to convert its current bonds into GDP-linked bonds.
If Greece does well, its creditors will receive more of their money; if it does not, they will get less.
Both sides would then have a powerful incentive to pursue pro-growth policies.
Seldom do democratic elections give as clear a message as that in Greece.
If Europe says no to Greek voters’ demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics.
Why not just shut down democracy, as Newfoundland effectively did when it entered into receivership before World War II?
One hopes that those who understand the economics of debt and austerity, and who believe in democracy and humane values, will prevail.
Whether they will remains to be seen.

Risky Growth Engines
WASHINGTON, DC – While the rich world puts its post-crisis house in order, developing countries as a whole are becoming the new engine of global growth.
Increasingly, they are a force pulling the advanced economies forward.
But switching locomotives is never free of risk.
As my colleague Marcelo Giugale and I argue in our recent book The Day After Tomorrow, there are at least four tracks along which this switchover is taking place.
First, public- and private-sector balance sheets in most emerging economies are relatively clean.
While deleveraging is ongoing in advanced economies, many developing countries will be able to explore untapped investment opportunities – infrastructure bottlenecks being a glaring example.
Second, there is a large inventory of technologies that the developing world is yet to acquire, adopt, and adapt.
Thanks to breakthroughs in information and communication, transferring those technologies is becoming cheaper and safer.
Furthermore, decreased transportation costs and the breakup of vertical production chains in many sectors are facilitating poorer countries’ integration into the global economy.
Third, a flipside of the emergence of new middle classes in many emerging markets is that domestic absorption (consumption and investment) in developing countries as a whole may rise relative to their own production potential.
Provided that South-South trade linkages are reinforced, one might see a new round of successful export-led growth in smaller countries.
Finally, resource-intensive developing countries may benefit from strong projected relative demand for commodities in the medium term.
As long as appropriate governance and revenue-administration mechanisms are put in place – particularly to avoid rent-seeking behavior – natural-resource availability may turn out to be a blessing rather than a curse for these countries.
Most developing countries were already moving along these four tracks before the global financial crisis, owing largely to improvements in their economic policies during the previous decade.
Given that these policies enabled these countries to respond well to shocks coming from the crisis epicenter, there are strong incentives to keep them in place.
There is, however, a major threat to a smooth transition to new sources of global growth: the possibility of overshooting in the inevitable asset-price adjustment accompanying the shift in relative growth prospects and perceptions of risks.
Indeed, because the creation of new assets in developing countries will be slower than the increase in demand for them, the price of existing assets in those markets – equities, bonds, real estate, human capital – are likely to overshoot their long-term equilibrium value.
Recent history is full of examples of the negative side-effects that can arise.
Each and every one of the recent booms and busts – in Latin America, Asia, and Russia in the 1990’s, and in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and Ireland more recently – shared some combination of unsustainably low financial costs, asset bubbles, over-indebtedness, wage growth unwarranted by productivity gains, and domestic absorption in excess of production.
In every case, these imbalances were fueled by easily identifiable periods of euphoria and sudden asset-prices increases.
True, external factors, such as foreign liquidity, were conducive – or at least permissive – to such periods of euphoria.
Twin current-account and fiscal deficits (and/or currency and debt-maturity mismatches) were the rule.
But our point is that powerful forces that drive up asset prices may be unleashed even without massive liquidity inflows.
The scramble for available assets and a dangerous euphoria may occur through purely domestic mechanisms.
So what should developing countries do, aside from maintaining sound macroeconomic policies, curbing excessive domestic financial leverage, and attempting to isolate themselves from volatile capital inflows?
The most important task is to facilitate and strengthen the creation of new assets, and there is much that developing countries can do in this regard.
They can take advantage of the current bonanza in available capital to build contestability, transparency, and institutional quality around markets in which greenfield investments can be implemented.
They can ensure that the rules they have in place are consistent and favorable to funding investment projects with long maturities.
And they can invest in their own capacity for project selection and design.
These and other internal reforms would serve to moderate the furious rise in the price of developing-country assets.
For that reason, they also constitute the best way to ensure that the next locomotives of global growth – and all the economies that are pulled by them – remain on the rails.

An Indirect Route to a Palestinian State?
RAMALLAH – Palestinians and Israelis have different and possibly contradictory expectations from the indirect negotiations that the United States has pushed both sides into beginning.
Israel was among the first parties to welcome the Arab League’s reluctant decision to back Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s call for Arabs to give their blessing to the talks.
It is clear that for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government, the start of indirect talks without freezing settlement activities in the West Bank and Jerusalem is a sort of victory. Just to remind the world of this, as the indirect talks were preparing to get off the ground, Israel’s government approved a decision to break ground on 112 housing units in a settlement south of Bethlehem, and 1600 new settlement units in East Jerusalem.
For Palestinians, the return to talks, albeit indirect, is focused on one strategic issue: borders.
The idea, a new one, aims at getting the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to the borders of the Palestinian state that both sides and the rest of the world have said is the way out of the decades-old conflict.
Palestinians want the areas occupied by Israel following the June 1967 War to be the territory of the Palestinian state.
This fits with United Nations Security Council resolutions, among them Number 242, which stated the "inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war."
But a return to the 1967 borders would mean that large settlement blocks – as well as smaller settlements and East Jerusalem – would be part of the Palestinians state.
Few expect that to happen.
Previous talks have included an allowance for land exchanges, which would permit Israel to keep many large settlement blocks by giving land inside Israel to the Palestinians.
The most likely swap would probably involve territory to create a West Bank-Gaza land corridor.
Jerusalem will be much more difficult to demarcate.
Palestinians and Israelis have publicly said that they do not want a wall separating West and East Jerusalem.
Among the various ideas in circulation, most incorporate former US President Bill Clinton’s call for Jerusalem’s Jewish communities to be part of Israel and the Arab communities to be part of Palestine.
But this plan has been put to the test lately by right-wing Israelis’ forcible takeover of Palestinian properties in the heart of East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarah neighborhood.
Hundreds of Israeli peace supporters, along with some international activists, have joined evicted Palestinians to protest the actions of these radical settlers, which have been supported by municipal and government officials.
Unfortunately, therefore, the indirect negotiations now being launched are unlikely to produce any tangible result on the borders of the Palestinian state.
Indeed, to expect such results by the proposed four-month deadline is highly implausible.
Nevertheless, for both sides, the process can be as important as the results.
For Israelis, these talks will relieve US and other international pressure, while at the same time providing some legitimacy to Netanyahu’s position of talking peace without giving up on settlements and Jerusalem.
Many will say that this appearance of supporting peace without surrendering land has been Israel’s successful position for decades.
For Palestinians however, this process is different from negotiations in the past.
Stubbornly refusing to talk face to face while settlement activities are not completely frozen has focused attention on what many believe is the crux of Israel’s colonial occupation regime.
For many Palestinians and Israelis, as well as for the international community, the shape and details of what would be a settlement acceptable to majorities on both sides is well known.
By focusing on the need to reach agreements on borders within a short time period, Palestinians are saying that they do not see any need to negotiate gradual steps, preferring to agree on the final settlement first and then work back on issues of implementation.
Perhaps the most interesting new aspect in the upcoming indirect talks is what has been happening on the ground in the occupied territories.
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad has been active in executing a strategic plan that is expected to lead to a de facto Palestinian state within a year and a half.
Non-violent protest has also been on the rise, whereas violent acts and suicide bombings have been drastically decreased.
The American negotiators who are planning to play an active role in the indirect talks, and will for the first time sit at the negotiating table if face-to-face talks do take place, have apparently promised the Palestinians that the US will point its finger at the party that dares to derail the negotiations.
Such a US declaration (if it declares Israel at fault) would give Palestinians the opportunity to declare the talks a failure and thus move toward a unilateral declaration of statehood in the hope that the world community will recognize such a state.
Europe has already said that it would recognize such a unilateral declaration.
In that case, the Americans would have a hard time refusing to recognize a Palestinian state that fits what the international community has said is the only acceptable solution to this intractable conflict.

The Storm after the Calm
PARIS – Could the financial crisis of 2007-2008 happen again?
Since the crisis erupted, there has been no shortage of opportunities – in the form of inadequate conclusions and decisions by officials – to nurture one’s anxiety about that prospect.
Over the course of the three G-20 summits held since the crisis, world leaders have agreed to tighten financial regulation slightly, but only for banks, while leaving other market players free of restrictions and scrutiny. As was true before the crisis, no one is monitoring the almost limitless “virtual” market for derivatives, where money moves freely without official rules or contact with the real economy.
And large players have plenty of cash with which to speculate, especially given the United States Federal Reserve’s decision to inundate the world with a sea of liquidity.
The result has not been investment in productive assets that boost employment in the US, as the Fed intended, but rather a run-up in global commodity prices and a growing bubble in the housing markets of the major emerging economies.
Simply put, there are no brakes that could stop the global economy from blundering into another financial crisis. Tax havens remain numerous, and their regulation anarchic.
The skimpy enforcement measures undertaken by bank regulators since the crisis are nowhere near appropriate to what is at stake.
Governments have refused to reinstate the absolute wall of separation between commercial and investment banks, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay deposit-insurance claims when the bubble-prone financial sector blows up.
Indeed, it is now clear that governments prevented a full-scale collapse of the financial system in 2008 by transforming toxic private debt into public debt.
It worked then, but it cannot work now, in large part because it contributed to the new, looming crisis in financial markets brought on by countries’ soaring public-debt burdens.
We cannot blame today’s emerging crisis solely on our current and recent governments’ actions.
For more than 20 years, the world’s major capitalist economies have been led to borrow heavily and unabashedly, in large by a new rule, adopted worldwide beginning in the 1970’s and 1980’s, that tied monetary policy to targets for price growth. This dangerous idea – proposed in France by Jacques Rueff in 1958, adopted throughout Europe over the following two decades, and extended to the European Central Bank – was intended to limit the tendency of capitalist economies to aggravate inflation as soon as they hit full employment.
But the rule ultimately had the terrifying result of obliging countries to borrow from private banks at market prices to guarantee their treasuries’ integrity. This created powerful barriers to public investment, as government spending was siphoned into massive profits for banks and their shareholders.
With the possible exception of the four Scandinavian countries, no society with a market economy found, or even sought, the equilibrium between state and market necessary to maintain a sufficient level of public services.
But even institutionalized monetary austerity has not stopped national public-debt levels from reaching 50-100% of GDP in Europe (higher in countries Greece and Italy) and surpassing 100% in the US.
Clearly, the official response to the 2008 crisis was perverse and detrimental at all levels.
Moreover, the 17 European countries that currently use the euro cannot devalue their currency unilaterally.
The euro is an important collective step forward, but to insure its credibility as a truly common currency, it should be treated as the embodiment of a true and whole-hearted solidarity.
The German government still does not admit that – as if France before the euro would have offered up Seine-Saint-Denis or Corsica to pay off its foreign debts to keep the franc.
Greece, a eurozone member, is now in just such an untenable situation.
If Greece defaults, an enormous amount of speculation will be possible.
Indeed, financial markets are unlikely to differentiate between Greek debt and that of other heavily indebted economies, including Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and even Italy – the most recent eurozone member to come under speculative attack.
This could well create a financial tsunami worth trillions of dollars, which explains the energy with which the European Central Bank and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, have tried to head off the worst.
Great Britain, Belgium, and even France find themselves at a debt level that does not leave much hope that they will escape unscathed.
Meanwhile, the US cannot meet its next debt payment unless Congress and the president reach an agreement to raise the national-debt ceiling.
The consequences of a US default have rightly been described with growing alarm as the risk increases.
It is still possible to repair all of this.
But the necessary financial measures can no longer be implemented while respecting states’ traditional and full sovereignty.
The US must renounce the imperialism of the dollar, and Germany must abandon its dream of a “deutscheuro,” managed as if the other 16 euro members were historical and cultural extensions of the German nation.
The approaching storm, and the measures that must be taken to address it, will bring enormous change.

The Wrong Lesson of Munich
NEW YORK – Seventy years ago this month in Munich, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, signed a document that allowed Germany to grab a large chunk of Czechoslovakia.
The so-called “Munich Agreement” would come to be seen as an abject betrayal of what Chamberlain termed “a far away country of which we know little.”
But that was not what many people thought at the time.
Chamberlain’s belief that Britain was not yet ready for war with Nazi Germany, and that diplomacy and compromise were safer options, was in fact shared by many Europeans, who knew from personal experience the horrible consequences of war.
Nonetheless, Chamberlain has gone down in history as a coward, and his “appeasement” of Nazi Germany is often blamed for Hitler’s subsequent campaign to conquer the rest of Europe.
Chamberlain was probably wrong. Britain and France could have stopped Germany.
“Munich, 1938,” was one of the rare occasions in the history of democracies when careful diplomacy was a mistake.
What was needed was a bloody-minded romantic hero, willing to gamble the fate of his nation by fighting on, “whatever the cost may be,” in the words of Winston Churchill.
George Santayana famously warned that “those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”
History, however, teaches many lessons, some of them contradictory, and is never repeated in quite the same way.
Sometimes too much attention paid to the past can lead us badly astray.
So, what, exactly, has the world learned from Munich, 1938?
If anything, West Europeans after World War II drew conclusions that were closer to Chamberlain’s thinking in 1938 than Churchill’s.
After two catastrophic wars, Europeans decided to build institutions that would make military conflict redundant.
Henceforth, diplomacy, compromise, and shared sovereignty would be the norm, and romantic nationalism, based on military prowess, would be a thing of the past.
Out of the ashes of war a new kind of Europe arose, as did a new kind of Japan, which even had a pacifist constitution (written by idealistic Americans, but gratefully accepted by most Japanese).
Nationalism (except in football stadiums) gave way to smug self-satisfaction at having found more civilized, diplomatic, and pacific solutions to human conflicts.
To be sure, the peace was kept. But only because it was guaranteed by the United States, which still stuck to pre-World War II notions of national and international security.
In the US, Munich has had a very different resonance.
There, it fed the Churchillian illusions of many a “war president” who dreamed of going down in history as freedom’s heroic defender.
Munich has been invoked over and over – to fight Communism, to topple Saddam Hussein, to stop Iran, and to wage a “war on terror.”
These different perspectives have caused peculiar tensions between the US and its democratic allies.
Europeans and Japanese depend on American military power for their security, but often don’t like the way the US uses it.
Too much dependence has also had an infantilizing effect. Like permanent adolescents, Europeans and Japanese crave the security of the great American father, and deeply resent him at the same time.
There is little doubt that the US, like all great powers, has embarked on foolish wars and acted like a bully, especially toward nations in its own hemisphere. But, even without invoking the ghosts of Munich, there are occasions when military force is the only way to deal with a tyrant.
Europeans were unwilling to stand up to Serbian mass murderers.
The Americans (after initial reluctance) had to do the dirty work. When the US decided to push Saddam Hussein’s killers out of Kuwait, German protesters screamed that they would never “shed blood for oil.”
On the other hand, European diplomacy has had some remarkable successes.
The prospect of joining the European Union helped consolidate democracy in central and eastern Europe, and in Turkey, too.
Some of these democracies have joined NATO, and others desperately want to.
NATO, however, unlike the EU, is a military organization.
Therein lies Chamberlain’s old problem: are Europeans prepared to fight wars on behalf of their fellow members?
During the Cold War, this was not a serious dilemma. Europeans relied on NATO and the US to defend them in case of Soviet aggression.
Now Georgia and the Ukraine would like to expect that Europeans and Americans would shed blood to defend them against Russia.
The choice is stark: if Europeans are prepared to fight for Georgia or Ukraine, these countries should be invited to join NATO.
If not, not.
But, instead of choosing, major European countries, such as Germany, have dithered, first dangling NATO membership as a juicy carrot, and then withdrawing the offer, leaving the Americans to indulge in heroic rhetoric without the necessary follow-through.
It is time for European democracies to make up their minds. They can remain dependent on US protection and stop complaining, or they can develop the capacity to defend Europe, however they wish to define it, by themselves.
The first option may not be feasible for very much longer in the twilight days of Pax America.
The second will be expensive and risky.
Given the many divisions inside the Union, Europeans will probably muddle on, until a serious crisis forces them to act, by which point it could well be too late.

Did Hezbollah Win?
In the immediate aftermath of the October War of 1973, the Arab world rejoiced because the myth of Israeli invincibility had been shattered by Egypt’s crossing of the Suez Canal and the Syrian offensive that swept across the Golan Heights.
In Israel, there was harsh criticism of political and military chiefs alike, who were blamed for the loss of 3,000 soldiers in a war that ended without a clear victory.
Prime Minister Golda Meir, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff David Elazar, and the chief of military intelligence were all discredited and soon replaced.
Only afterwards did a sense of proportion take hold, ironically by the Egyptian and Syrian leaders before anyone else.
While commentators in Israel and around the world were still mourning or gloating over Israel’s lost military supremacy, both Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad soberly recognized that their countries had come closer to catastrophic defeat than in 1967, and that it was imperative to avoid another war.
That lead to Sadat’s peace and Assad’s 1974 cease-fire on the Golan Heights, which has never been violated since.
It is easy to read the 1973 war only in retrospect.
Israel had been caught by surprise, because good intelligence was misinterpreted in a climate of arrogant over-confidence.
The frontal sectors, left almost unguarded, were largely overrun.
The Egyptians had an excellent war plan and fought well, and Syrian tanks advanced boldly, attacking in wave after wave for three days and nights.
Within 48 hours, Israel seemed on the verge of defeat on both fronts.
But as soon as the IDF was fully mobilized and the reservist brigades that make up nine-tenths of its strength were ready to deploy for battle, the Israelis stopped both the Egyptian and Syrian armies in their tracks and began their own advance almost immediately.
The war ended with Israeli forces 70 miles from Cairo, and less than 20 miles from Damascus, their success obscured by the shock of the surprise attack, emotional over-reactions, and the difficulty of seeing clearly through the fog of war.
It is the same now with the Lebanon war and the gross misperceptions that have followed.
No one should be surprised the latest anti-tank missiles can penetrate even the heaviest and best protected of battle tanks.
But Israel’s tanks did well enough in limiting Israeli casualties.
Likewise, the lack of defenses against short-range rockets with small warheads is simply common sense.
They are just not powerful enough to justify spending billions of dollars for laser weapon systems the size of football fields.
More serious misperceptions are equally obvious.
For example, instead of dismissing Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah’s boasts of victory, many commentators around the world repeat and endorse his claim that Hezbollah fought much more bravely than the regular soldiers of Arab states in previous wars.
But in 1973, after crossing the Suez Canal, Egyptian infantrymen by the thousand stood their ground unflinchingly against advancing Israeli battle tanks. They were in the open, flat desert, with none of the cover and protection that Hezbollah had in their stone-built villages in Lebanon.
What is true is that the Israelis lacked a coherent war plan, so that even their most purposeful bombing came off as brutally destructive (though with a deterrence payoff, as Syria’s immobility showed).
Similarly, Israel’s ground actions were hesitant and inconclusive from start to finish. A fully developed contingency plan – a sophisticated blend of amphibious, airborne, and ground penetrations to reach swiftly and deeply behind the front, before rolling back and destroying Hezbollah positions one by one from the rear, all the way to the Israeli border – was never implemented.
The contingency plan remained on the shelf because of the lack of casualties among Israeli civilians.
It had been assumed that thousands of Hezbollah rockets fired in concentrated barrages – which cancel out the inaccuracy of unguided rockets and powerfully compound blast effects – would kill many civilians, perhaps hundreds each day.
That would make a large-scale offensive by more than 45,000 soldiers a compelling necessity, justifying politically the hundreds of casualties it would have cost.
Hezbollah, however, distributed its rockets to village militias that were good at hiding them from air attacks, sheltering them from artillery, and from probing Israeli unmanned air vehicles, but that were incapable of launching them effectively in simultaneous launches against the same targets.
Instead of hundreds of dead civilians, the Israelis were losing one or two a day.
Even after three weeks, the total was less than in some one-man suicide bombings.
That made it politically unacceptable to launch an offensive that would kill young soldiers and family men.
Indeed, nor would such an offensive have eradicated Hezbollah, because it is a political movement in arms, and not just an army or a band of gunmen.
For that very reason, the outcome of the war is likely to be more satisfactory than many now seem to believe.
Unlike Yasser Arafat, who fought for eternal Palestine and not for actual Palestinians, whose prosperity and safety he was always willing to sacrifice for the cause, Nasrallah has a political constituency centered in southern Lebanon.
Having implicitly accepted responsibility for starting the war, Nasrallah has directed Hezbollah to focus on rapid reconstruction in villages and towns, right up to the Israeli border.
Nasrallah’s power base is now a hostage of Hezbollah’s good behavior.
He can hardly afford to start another round of fighting that would destroy everything again.

Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey?
EMBARGO 6 SEPTEMBER 2004
More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community.
With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996.
During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria.
Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.
Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005.
Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world.
In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam.
It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges.
However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015.
This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms.
With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.
But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.
Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance.
The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey.
In any case, the EU's practice of "capping" its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession.
Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025.
Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point.
Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity.
Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation.
It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture. It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state.
Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded.
But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes.
Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries.
As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed "Christian club" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity.
Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world.
The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force.
At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps.
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges.
On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.

Erdoğan’s Choice
ISTANBUL – “Turkish democracy is at a turning point,” Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced after winning a crucial vote in a referendum to change Turkey’s constitution. “We are sitting an important exam.”
Erdoğan is right, but it is he who must pass the test.
If the plebiscite victory emboldens him and his allies to step up their tactics of judicial dirty tricks and media manipulation – used to great effect in recent years – the prospects for Turkey are bleak.
The country will descend deeper into authoritarianism, political divisions will become irreconcilable, and yet another political rupture may become inevitable.
Too few people in Europe and the United States comprehend the extent to which Erdoğan’s government has undermined the rule of law and basic freedoms – all in the name of “deepening Turkish democracy.”
Government prosecutors have mounted a series of sham trials, charging hundreds of military officers, academics, and journalists with membership in an armed terrorist organization aiming to topple the Erdoğan government.
In a separate but related prosecution, they used fabricated evidence to accuse nearly 200 active and retired military officers of planning a coup in 2003, during the early days of Erdoğan’s first government.
Erdoğan and his ministers have been cheerleaders for these prosecutions.
Their supporters in the media have spewed a stream of disinformation and leaked wiretaps to discredit and embarrass the accused.
Meanwhile, the country’s largest independent media group has been brought to heel by huge, politically motivated tax fines.
Erdoğan’s strategy has been to whip up frenzy around these cases to solidify his traditional, religious/conservative base, but also to gain the backing of domestic liberals.
The prosecutions have allowed him to position himself as the protector of Turkish democracy against the coup plotters allegedly still running rampant among the military and secularists.
The prosecutions entail indictments that are thousands of pages long and include annexes that take up several bookshelves.
This, along with media disinformation, has made it difficult for outsiders to penetrate the cases and separate fact from fiction.
But as soon as we engage with the details of the prosecutions, a shocking picture emerges: some of the key evidence in the cases is clearly planted, while much of the rest remains circumstantial at best.
For example, the alleged 2003 coup plot was supposedly discovered when CDs containing detailed preparations (including assassination teams and plans to bomb two mosques) were delivered to a virulently anti-military newspaper.
Of the hundreds of senior officers serving at the time, none has acknowledged any knowledge of these plans.
Indeed, it is patently clear that people intent on framing military officers authored the documents in question many years later, in 2008 at the earliest.
In addition to major internal contradictions and inconsistencies, the coup plot documents are full of references to entities that did not even exist in 2003, as well as to developments that took place later.
The prosecutors have shown little interest in these discrepancies, doing their best to send the alleged conspirators to jail (and keep them there) even before the trial starts.
Erdoğan has fanned the flames by claiming that he was aware of such coup plans at the time, but that he disregarded them.
A dramatic book that was published just before the referendum on the constitution sheds light on who is behind these machinations.
It claims that followers of Fethullah Gulen – the influential US-based spiritual leader – have effectively wrested control of the national police and large parts of the judiciary.
The Gulen movement is independent from Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), but the two have long been closely allied, and now it has become a state within a state, employing extra-legal means, including illegal wiretaps and fabricated evidence, to go after perceived opponents.
Accusations against the Gulen movement are not new in Turkey, but what made the book a bombshell is that its author is a distinguished police chief, well known for his courage and incorruptibility – as well as his closeness to the Gulenists and to Erdoğan’s government.
No friend of the army, he pursued rogue elements within the military in a famous investigation several years ago.
So he cannot be accused of harboring ultra-secularist or ultra-nationalist sympathies. This, along with his inside knowledge of the workings of the police and the prosecutorial branch, give his revelations a credibility that earlier accounts had lacked.
Tellingly, the police chief went to his governmental superiors prior to the book’s publication, appealing personally to a minister.
But the government refused to investigate and did nothing with the information.
The most benign explanation for this behavior is that it is a consequence of the AKP’s own long history of persecution by the military and secular old guard.
The AKP has been under constant threat of a ban through much of its existence, and Erdoğan was jailed for reciting a poem with religious imagery. Perhaps the dirty tricks are largely defensive, meant to ensure that the old guard never threatens the AKP’s existence again.
If so, the referendum’s outcome should convince Erdoğan that the balance of power in the country has changed for good, and that the days of strong-arm tactics by the secular establishment are gone forever.
Here is a chance for Erdoğan and his allies to back off from their gross violations of the rule of law and build the democracy that they so fervently claim as their goal.
An important first step would be to restore confidence in the integrity and independence of the judiciary and law enforcement.
The amended constitution expands the constitutional court and the supreme council of judges and prosecutors.
The exam that the government must sit is to use its new powers to appoint widely-respected, impartial members – rather than divisive satraps – to these bodies.

Fighting the Fed
CAMBRIDGE – The US Federal Reserve is battling with members of Congress over a proposed law, the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act, that would require the Fed to use a formal rule to guide monetary policy.
The Fed fears that the law would limit its independence, while the bill’s proponents argue that it would produce more predictable growth with low inflation.
Who is right?
In order to understand the conflict, it is useful to compare the Fed’s independence with that of the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.
In Britain, the BoE has “instrument independence” but not “target independence.”
The head of the Treasury sets a goal for the inflation rate and leaves it to the BoE to decide which policies will achieve that goal.
If the target is missed by more than one percentage point on either side, the BoE’s governor must send an open letter to the head of the Treasury explaining why (and what the Bank proposes to do about it).
By contrast, the Maastricht Treaty tasked the ECB with maintaining “price stability,” but left it free to provide its own operational definition.
The ECB defined price stability to be annual inflation of less than but close to 2%.
Given the structure of the European Monetary Union, there is no government oversight of the ECB, which thus has both “target independence” and “instrument independence,” though restrictions preclude specific policies.
The Fed is “independent,” but only in a very special sense: vis-à-vis the government’s executive branch.
While the US president can instruct administrative agencies like the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department to take specific actions (as long as they do not conflict with valid legislation), the administration cannot tell the Fed how to manage interest rates, reserve requirements, or any other aspects of monetary policy.
But, though the Fed is independent of the White House, it is not independent of Congress.
The Fed was created by Congressional legislation that now stipulates a “dual mandate” of price stability and maximum employment.
It is up to the Fed to formulate operational definitions of these goals and the policies it will pursue to achieve them.
The proposed legislation would affect both “target” and “instrument” independence.
The Fed decided to define price stability as a “two percent annual inflation over the medium term of the price index of consumer expenditures.”
For the past 12 months, that rate of increase has been about 1.5%.
While full employment has not been defined, many economists believe it is equivalent to an unemployment rate of about 5.5%.
The most recent rate was 6.1%.
Reflecting the fear that the Fed’s current policy of sustained low interest rates will lead to higher inflation, the law would require the Fed to adopt a formal procedure for setting its key short-term interest rate, the “federal funds rate.”
More specifically, the law suggests a specific interest-rate rule (the Reference Policy Rule) while giving the Fed the opportunity to adopt a different rule if it explains to Congress why it prefers the alternative.
The Reference Policy Rule is essentially the rule first proposed in 1993 by John Taylor of Stanford University, based on his statistical estimate of what the Fed appeared to have been doing under Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan during a period of both low inflation and low unemployment.
It states that the federal funds rate should be 2% plus the current inflation rate plus one-half of the difference between current and target inflation and one-half of the percentage difference between current and full-employment GDP.
All of this implies that if the economy is at full employment and targeted inflation, the federal funds rate should equal 2% plus the rate of inflation.
It should be higher if the inflation rate is above the target level and lower if current GDP is less than the full-employment level.
Given uncertainty about the level of full-employment GDP, this rule still leaves the Fed substantial discretion.
The Fed could argue that the gap between current and full-employment GDP is larger than the 6.1% unemployment rate implies, owing to the large number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time employment and the sharp decline in the labor force participation rate. If the GDP gap is 4%, as a recent Congressional Budget Office estimate implied, the Taylor rule would indicate an optimal federal funds rate of about 1.25% (2 + 1.5 – 0.25 – 2), compared to the current rate of only 0.1%.
While the federal funds rate may be heading to 1% over the next 12 or 18 months, by then the narrowing GDP gap will imply an even higher Taylor-rule interest rate.
And, complicating things further, given US banks’ vast holdings of excess reserves as a result of the Fed’s bond-buying policies (quantitative easing), the federal funds rate is no longer the key policy rate that it once was. Instead, the Fed will be focusing on the interest rate on excess reserves.
The proposed legislation is full of excessive and impossible requirements, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives may not be able to pass it, even in modified form. Even if it does, it will not get through the Democratic-controlled Senate.
But if the Republicans hold a Senate majority after the next election, some form of legislation requiring a monetary-policy rule could land on the president’s desk.
He or she might veto it, but a Republican president after the 2016 election might not.
The Fed no doubt fears that if the principle of requiring a formal rule is accepted, Congress could tighten the requirement, forcing a more restrictive monetary policy.
That is why the new Fed chair, Janet Yellen, forcefully opposed such legislation in recent congressional testimony.
One thing is certain: The bill will put pressure on the Fed to pay more attention to inflation, avoiding a persistent rate above its own 2% target.
Otherwise, the Fed’s operational independence could be restricted, forcing it to focus its policies more sharply on its inflation mandate.

Winning the War on Child Sexual Abuse
NEW DELHI – With every new crisis that the world faces, humanity’s differences appear increasingly intractable.
Religion, ethnicity, history, politics, and economics have all become tools to denigrate and demean.
People seem to be drifting apart, and no country is immune from divisive discourse.
But there is one fundamental issue where contrasts dissolve into consensus: the desire to keep children safe.
Protecting the physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing of children is a universal instinct that no faith, dogma, or ideology can defeat.
And yet, despite this shared instinct, children everywhere continue to be preyed upon. Too often, societies ignore child sexual abuse, owing to family pride or fear of stigma.
The world can stay silent no longer.
The numbers are truly alarming.
According to a 2016 World Health Organization report, one of every four adults was sexually abused as a child. A 2007 Indian government study found that 53% of children in India faced some form of sexual abuse growing up.
And human trafficking, especially trafficking of children, is a booming business, with annual average profits totaling $150 billion.
In other words, child sexual abuse is a moral epidemic afflicting the entire world –one that we can defeat only when we openly declare open against it.
Young victims and their families should not have to live in silence while predators roam fearless and free.
That is why, in December 2016, I joined a diverse group of Nobel laureates and global leaders to launch the “100 Million for 100 Million”campaign.
One of the campaign’s objectives is to persuade, provoke, and inspire 100 million young people around the world to raise their voices against violence inflicted on children.
The response so far has been overwhelming; tens of thousands have taken the pledge to defend the defenseless.
But I believe we must do even more to awaken the world’s slumbering consciousness on this evil.
So on September 11, I will embark on a bharat yatra (political pilgrimage), traveling across India to declare war on sexual abuse and exploitation of children everywhere.
Together with dedicated campaigners and child-rights advocates, I will travel from Kanyakumari, on India’s southern tip, to India’s capital, Delhi.
More than ten million people are expected to join me physically and virtually on a march that will traverse 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles), touching all corners of India in a bid to raise global awareness.
Cynics might say that marches cannot change engrained social taboos.
I disagree.
I have seen first-hand how change is possible when ordinary people speak out.
In 1998, I accompanied a group of young people from around the world to the headquarters of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva.
One by one, these brave children told the assembled leaders of their chained lives as forced laborers.
They demanded the freedom to chase their own dreams.
And they called for an international law against child labor.
It was the culmination of the Global March Against Child Labor, and more than 15 million people had joined us by marching some 80,000 kilometers through 103 countries.
The result of these combined efforts was dramatic and pathbreaking.
Within a year, the ILO passed Convention 182, which banned the worst forms of child labor.
Today, 181 countries have ratified the convention and passed domestic laws that ban the practice.
Back in 1998, when we launched the global march – amid similar cynicism and apathy – roughly 250 million children were being forced to work in horrific conditions.
Though much remains to be done, that number has since dropped by about a third, and I am confident we can reach zero within a generation.
We have also had success marching for civil liberties in India.
In 2001, our shiksha yatra (march for education) called on government officials to make access to school a fundamental right for all children.
Today, that right is enshrined in the Indian Constitution, and primary school enrollment is almost universal.
The world needs a similar effort against child sexual abuse and trafficking.
As many as two million children are victims of trafficking every year, with many sold into the sex trade.
Young refugees are especially at risk.
In 2016, a record number of people – more than 65 million – were forced from their homes by civil war and other unrest.
When children are displaced, they become highly vulnerable to trafficking and sexual abuse, underscoring the need to act decisively.
When we begin marching this month, we will do so as non-violent soldiers in a global war.
Our goal is to give voice to ordinary victims who have been silenced by fear and social pressure.
We aim to tug at the conscience of people everywhere, to provoke others into action.
Mahatma Gandhi galvanized millions of oppressed people through his marches.
So did Martin Luther King Jr.
Let us be inspired by them, and wage a humanitarian war against child sexual abuse.
India is ready to march again on a journey of hope and audacity.
We invite the world to join us.

How Seattle Can Disrupt Tuberculosis
SEATTLE – A major report recently published by the medical journal The Lancet finds that a tuberculosis-free world is possible.
While TB is not an issue that many in Seattle think about, many of the city’s leading institutions are actually doing a tremendous amount to reduce the 4,400 deaths from tuberculosis that occur each and every day.
TB is a contagious, potentially fatal infectious disease that destroys body tissue, particularly affecting the lungs. As an airborne disease, it can be spread when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or even speaks.
Though TB is curable with antibiotics, if the medicine is not taken properly, an even more dangerous drug-resistant strain of the disease – which some call “Ebola with wings” – emerges.
Despite the scale of the TB threat, research funders and the pharmaceutical industry have largely ignored the disease over the past 50 years.
The reason is as simple as it is indefensible: TB disproportionately affects the poor and disenfranchised, who often cannot pay for treatment.
Given the lack of investment in the fight against TB, progress stalled, and prevention continued to center on an 80-year-old vaccine with limited efficacy.
Diagnosis continued to rely on a 125-year-old test that fails to detect the disease in half of all cases.
And treatment continued to mean a six-month-long drug regimen that has remained virtually unchanged for 60 years.
As a result, TB continues to kill one person every 20 seconds.
In 2017, it killed a total of 1.6 million people – the highest death toll of any infectious disease.
In the last decade, however, TB has started to get the attention it deserves, particularly among Seattle-based health organizations.
Scientists at the University of Washington, the Institute for Systems Biology, and Seattle Children’s Research Institute are deepening our understanding of the biology of TB.
The Institute for Disease Modeling and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation are improving disease tracking.
The Infectious Disease Research Institute, Global Good, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center are developing better tests, drugs, and vaccines.
And PATH is pioneering better ways to deliver TB care in the world’s most challenging settings.
Thanks to the work of these organizations – as well as the generosity and technical prowess of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation – doctors now have a new and more accurate test to diagnose TB, more potent drugs to cure drug-resistant strains, and a promising vaccine candidate.
But developing these tools is just the first step.
Innovation is also needed to enable their delivery to those who need them most.
And, on that front, progress has been much slower.
According to the Lancet report, further gains in the fight against TB are contingent upon delivering services to the ten million people who will develop the disease in the next year.
This cannot be left up to the health community alone.
Seattle’s tech companies – which are already changing the way people live, connect, and consume with disruptive technologies – must also contribute their expertise and vision.
Imagine a world in which public-health officials in the most impoverished settings could tap into Amazon’s marketing prowess, Tableau’s analytical power, and PEMCO’s understanding of health behaviors.
Imagine if they could take advantage of Microsoft’s cloud-based services, Google’s data streams, Facebook’s reach, and Uber’s delivery capacity.
In such a world, outreach through social media could help ensure care for the four million people who go undiagnosed each year.
Smart pillboxes could help TB patients to take their medications.
Mobile phone-based cough monitoring could help health-care providers ensure that patients are responding appropriately to treatment.
Moreover, artificial intelligence-based algorithms could help health workers provide optimal care to patients and real-time data about the TB burden to public-health officials.
Blockchain-based systems could keep patients in control of who has access to their medical information. And, when needed, the “gig” workforce could contribute transportation and logistical support.
Before long, such a world would be TB-free.
To realize this vision, Seattle’s health leaders must collaborate with the region’s technology companies.
Corporate executives could establish partnerships with public-health bodies to identify opportunities to fulfill their oft-repeated promises to deploy technology to advance the common good. Their employees could then collaborate with TB researchers to develop effective projects and products.
The first step is to create a comprehensive strategy for integrating biomedical research and digital technologies in the next decade.
Otherwise, by 2030, TB could claim another 15 million lives.
That is not a world where any of us wants to live.

Iran’s Options
Berlin -- With President Bush in Europe getting EU leaders to agree to toughen UN sanctions against Iran, and with the ongoing debate between John McCain and Barack Obama about whether the US needs to talk with Iran’s rulers, the issue of Iran’s nuclear program is heating up. Iranians, no surprise, are watching this debate with interest. They need to do more than watch.
Iran’s political elite sees the United States, rather than Europe, as their appropriate international counterpart.
Only the US can give the Islamic Republic the security guarantees it craves.
The US, indeed, should be prepared to eventually give such guarantees if it wants Iran to stop the more suspicious parts of its nuclear program.
But Iran must do its part to make any future dialogue with the US a success.
In talks with members of Iran’s policy community, I am continually astounded that they see resolving the nuclear conflict (or, indeed, other problems in which Iran has a stake) to be primarily the responsibility of the US, Europe, and other major powers, not of Iran.
Such passivity is not in Iran’s interest. As the Middle East’s essential regional player, Iran can trigger and heat up conflicts as well as contribute to their solution.
Yet few in the Iranian establishment understand that being the leading regional power brings responsibility; and that only responsible behavior can create legitimacy and acceptance that Iran craves.
Iranian policymakers must, therefore, try to develop their own ideas for a negotiated resolution of the nuclear and other regional security issues, as well as to think about how Iran can rebuild trust in its actions.
Iran’s leaders should begin by shunning hostile rhetoric.
Incendiary statements about Israel exacerbate the lack of trust among Iran’s would-be partners, and make it hard for those in Europe and the US who are interested in building more favorable relations.
Iran hints that it wants to have a high-level dialogue with the US in the not-too-distant future.
If true, Iran should realize that violent statements on sensitive issues will set back any serious attempt to get a dialogue going.
Iran could also build trust if it became more transparent, particularly about its own strategic ambitions.
A good start would be to publish key documents that are constantly referred to by Iranians but never seen – say, Ayatollah Khamenei’s fatwa that reportedly rules that Islam prohibits the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons?
It would also be helpful if Iran laid out its strategic vision for the region.
It should accept the concerns of its neighbors, seek to develop its own ideas for regional confidence- and security building, and participate in efforts to create regional security arrangements.
It should also positively respond to offers from the US to establish confidence-building measures between the two countries’ military forces, particularly their navies.
As to the nuclear issue, Iran should try to switch from the language of “inalienable rights” to one of pragmatic solutions.
This would help depoliticize the issue.
The right to independent nuclear research and development under the NPT is not disputed.
But rather than insist as a matter of principle on operating the fuel cycle independently under national sovereignty, Iran could engage the Saudis about their idea of a regional joint venture, or explore different options of multilateral consortia with other countries.
Iran’s parliament, now led by Ali Larijani, Iran’s former nuclear negotiator, could make a strong contribution to confidence building and to the resolution of the nuclear conflict by ratifying the NPT’s Additional Protocol.
Other clarifications are also needed. Is Iran prepared to accept a compromise that responds to European and other international concerns about its nuclear program, and thereby gain wide-ranging economic, energy, technology and science cooperation?
Nuclear energy, after all, is only one technology, and a 20th century, rather than a 21st century one at that.
Eventually, partnership with Europe could help Iran keep the best of its young generation at home rather than having them queue for visas at foreign embassies – or, more often, the US consulates in Istanbul or Dubai.
The willingness of major countries to accept Iran with a nuclear status similar to Japan depends on whether Iran not only refers to itself as a status-quo power – which it occasionally does – but whether it acts as such.
If it wants to be seen as a status-quo power, it needs to accept local and international efforts at establishing peace between Israel and its neighbors.
For a grand bargain with the US, Iran needs to end its support for militant organizations like Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad which undermine efforts at reaching a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
Even without such a bargain, however, Iran will have to do certain things if it wants to be seen as a constructive regional player.
It will have to accept all the other states in the region as legitimate players with their own legitimate interests as much as it wants to be recognized as such itself.
It will also have to accept the wish of the huge majority of Palestinians for a peaceful settlement with Israel.
Iranian officials sometimes try to make relative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s more violent statements about Israel as nothing more than a call for “regime change.”
That is not a status-quo policy.
Iran is entitled to seek assurances against externally forced regime change.
But it cannot have it both ways, seeking guarantees against regime change at home, and promoting it in its neighborhood.

Nature by the Numbers
NORWICH – When Cyclone Amphan came barreling up the Bay of Bengal this past May, South Asia’s first named storm of the year appeared to pose a massive threat to the people who live on the coastal floodplains and to the animals and plants – including many endangered species – that rely on these sensitive ecosystems.
But nature came to the region’s rescue.
The Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest, offered better protection than any man-made storm wall could have done.
When Amphan’s 16-foot storm surge slammed into this 4,000-square-mile national park, the mangroves took the teeth out of it, just as they did with the two other supercharged cyclones, Aila and Sidr, that have made landfall in recent times.
On the other side of the world, natural storm defenses on the lower end of Manhattan have long since been paved over.
Real-estate developers have even extended the island into New York Harbor with acres of landfill, neglecting to build up storm surge protections.
As a result, when Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy hammered the city in 2011 and 2012, respectively, lower Manhattan, including the city’s financial district, was inundated.
City planners have since been working with the US government to plan for the next wave of superstorms.
But the price tag of the infrastructure needed – a retractable wall across New York Harbor costing at least $62 billion – has prevented any plans from being finalized.
As we look to rebuild the global economy following the COVID-19 crisis, conserving our remaining natural assets must be a top priority.
If we don’t act, we risk losing the plants, animals, and microorganisms needed to keep our air clean, our water pure, and our food supplies plentiful – not to mention the mangrove forests and barrier reefs that stand between us and the superstorms that are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change.
The world has become less wild as we have built and expanded cities, cut down forests for crops and livestock, drained wetlands for roads, and flooded valleys for dams.
The economic cost of this ecological damage goes mostly uncounted.
But it is prohibitively high, eroding the value of goods and services that nature produces.
One million species are now at risk of extinction.
Fortunately, there is a relatively simple initiative underway to curb some of these losses and solve our looming conservation crises.
Under the heading of “30x30,” it aims to protect 30% of our planet’s land and oceans by 2030 through effective, permanent measures.
More than 20 member states in the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity have already committed to supporting this global target.
According to a new report authored by more than 100 scientists and economists from around the world, expanding existing protected areas to 30% of the planet would add $250 billion to annual global economic output, on average.
(The report estimates a range of $64-454 billion, as the costs and benefits will vary depending on which areas are protected.)
Moreover, the study finds that protected areas and the nature-based activities they support are among the world’s fastest-growing economic sectors, with 4-6% projected annual revenue growth, compared to less than 1% in agriculture, and negative growth in fisheries.
For countries with large areas of forest and mangroves, embracing 30x30 would prevent the loss of an average of $350 billion ($170-534 billion) annually in ecosystem services.
These costs stem largely from flooding, soil loss, storm surges, and the release of stored carbon that occurs when natural vegetation is destroyed. By protecting India and Bangladesh over the years, the Sundarbans have provided an extraordinarily valuable service.
Conversely, the environmental destruction in the Brazilian portion of the Amazon rainforest has resulted in major, far-reaching losses.
Even the drinking water shortages that afflict São Paulo, the largest city in the Americas, are directly connected to Amazon deforestation.
As governments contemplate how to re-open their economies after the COVID-19 lockdown, they must accommodate the need for greater conservation and restoration of natural resources.
Every tropical storm that is strong enough to be named should serve as a reminder of what is at stake if we do nothing. With recent forecasts of an “above-normal 2020 Atlantic hurricane season,” the US east coast should already be bracing itself.
India and Bangladesh are fortunate to have the Sundarbans.
But no country in the world lacks natural areas that are worth conserving or restoring. Not only is it critical for all countries to adopt the 30x30 target, but each should also look for ways to invest more in its natural areas.
By doing so now, governments can ensure that nature-based sectors and ecosystem services will recover at the same pace as the rest of the economy.
There’s no better time to start than before another storm strikes.

Revolutionary Shadows
VIENNA – What happens after the euphoria of revolution fades?
Today’s Eastern Europe, some two decades after the revolutions of 1989, may offer a salutary warning for today’s defiant and jubilant Arab youth that they must remain vigilant.
Ever since I left Romania for exile in 1986, my returns have been rare and tense.
Although the schedule for my most recent trip was overwhelming, and offered little real contact with ordinary people, I could still grasp – from daily newspapers, TV programs, and conversations with friends – the profound economic, political, and moral crisis engulfing the country. Mistrust and anger toward a corrupt and inefficient political class, coupled with skepticism about democracy – even nostalgia for communism – is to be found nowadays not only in Romania, but also in some other parts of Eastern Europe.
Some 70% of Romanians reportedly now claim to regret the death of Comrade Nicolae Ceauşescu, whose summary execution in 1989 elicited general enthusiasm.
Of course, the source of such an astonishing finding is difficult to trust, like everything else in Romanian politics, but the vulgar and radical coarsening of public discourse – now peppered with old-new xenophobic elements – is clear enough.
I was offered a taste of this as a guest on a well-respected TV cultural program.
I was amused that the debate focused not on my books, but on issues like the “Jewish cultural mafia” and the “exaggerated” anti-Semitism of past and present Romania.
My interviewer was kinetic, taking over the dialogue with insinuations and personal interventions.
I assumed that I was supposed to be provoked into unguarded comments, a method that fashionable TV journalists everywhere use nowadays.
But I faced a new surprise the following week, when, on the same TV program, the hostess was rather passive towards her guest, a militant journalist turned mercenary journalist, as he confessed his admiration for Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the “Captain” of the Iron Guard, the far-right Orthodox terrorist organization of the pre-war years.
The journalist considered Codreanu a “Romantic hero.”
A group of Romanian intellectuals, including me, protested in an Open Letter against this effort to rehabilitate a murderer and propagandist of hate and xenophobia.
Romanian TV answered promptly that it understood that victims of anti-Semitic crimes might feel hurt by such a program, but that the program had not promoted this kind of propaganda, offering the bizarre interview with me the previous week as proof of the channel’s good faith.
But the debate didn’t end there.
Soon after, the national committee for the media condemned the program.
And soon after that, some leading intellectuals condemned the national committee’s condemnation as an affront to freedom of speech.No one mentioned the danger of inciting an already radicalized audience.
In fact, the responses from members of the public to these controversies were mostly of a vulgar nationalistic and anti-Semitic tone.
Romania is not alone, of course, in reliving this dark comedy.
Revitalization of the extreme right in Hungary and the rise of “National Bolshevism” in Russia, where Tolstoy is now re-condemned by the Orthodox Church as a proto-communist, suggest a deeper and more pervasive atavistic longing.
I was reminded of my last class at Bard College before my trip to Romania.
We were discussing Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice.
Commenting on the moment when “Asiatic cholera” kills the great and troubled writer Gustav von Aschenbach, a brilliant Asian student pointed out that Mann related the disease to the “pestilence” of the Ganges delta, which traversed China and Afghanistan, Persia and Astrakhan, and “even Moscow,” before reaching Europe through the “city of the lagoon.”
She noted with gravity today’s migrations from poor to prosperous countries, the globalization of evil, the contradictions and conflicts of modernity, the angry terrorist response to it, and the contrast between a rational, pragmatic West and a more idealistic and superstitious East, prone to religious fanaticism and political extremism.
It was a relief to listen to my student’s well-articulated opinions and to see in her the hope of a new, cosmopolitan generation.
But her example was also an unavoidable reminder of the great dangers of our time.
I needed that hope, for what I saw in Eastern Europe had depressed me as much as what I was seeing in the United States, my adopted homeland.
For someone who lived through two totalitarian systems, it is almost unbearable to contemplate America’s decline.
Although we refugees, immigrants, exiles, and outcasts do not boast ad infinitum that “we are the best,” as many Americans do, we still believe that the US remains a powerful guarantor of freedom and democracy, and we consider its incoherence part of its liberty.
For far different reasons, the US, and the entire world, seems condemned to simplification of thought, action, and feeling in the service of immediate, quotidian efficiency.
Of course, art and culture can offer a respite from the oversimplifications of our age – a respite that we need more than ever if we are to reckon with the destiny behind and before us.
But we also need modesty about ourselves and our societies.
Some years ago, I proposed that every country should add to its monuments to heroism some monuments to its national shame. After all, guilt is as significant as courage in any human enterprise.
To remember and reflect on how we have wronged other people and nations may benefit a country’s citizens as much as celebrating great deeds.
Monuments to shame would not resolve the insoluble problems of humanity’s fate on Earth, but they might slow the advance of its dark side – in Eastern Europe, the Arab world, and everywhere else.

How to Sell Anti-Protectionism
STOCKHOLM – The looming global recession has brought government intervention to save failing companies to the forefront of economic policy. In a speech just prior to the recent G-20 summit, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned President-elect Barack Obama against bailing out America’s struggling Big Three automakers, arguing that global competition has made their decline irreversible.
A bailout, then, would simply delay the inevitable at a huge cost to taxpayers.
Such advice is always tough to sell – all the more so in the face of the worst economic outlook in 70 years.
After all, according to conventional wisdom, global competition moves jobs to low-cost countries and puts downward pressure on wages everywhere else. As globalization intensifies and accelerates economic change, it affects the lives of ordinary citizens like never before, stoking popular fear.
Little wonder, then, that French president Nicolas Sarkozy succumbed to the allure of protectionism during last year’s election campaign, as did both presidential candidates in the United States.
But protectionism need not be the only alternative to fear of global competition.
In the Scandinavian countries, as in the US, foreign competition intensified sharply during the past decade.
China and India gained considerable economic power, and close neighbors in previously isolated communist states were rapidly integrated in the European economy.
However, surveys by Pew Research show that in Sweden, 85% of the population agrees that trade is good for their country, compared to only 59% of Americans.
Among Swedish industrial workers, the figure is 75% in favor.
How can that be?
By designing educational and social protection policies that strengthen the individual, Scandinavian politicians have sought to promote change rather than prevent it.
The positive public opinion in Sweden is not a symptom of brainwashing, but a rational response to people’s experience during the last decade.
As competition intensified and production started moving to the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, Sweden’s policy answer was to upgrade the skills of the work force.
As a result, from 1997 to 2007, Swedish exports nearly doubled and industrial production grew by 36%, with manufacturing companies achieving record-high productivity growth.
Indeed, while annual US output per hour grew by 6.2% during this period, Swedish productivity rose by 8%.
Sweden accumulated a current-account surplus of 53% of GDP, in contrast to America’s 48%-of-GDP deficit.
Employment rose by 11%, and blue-collar workers’ wages increased by 24%, fueling a more than 30% surge in private consumption.
In short, even as globalization progressed, Swedish wage earners enjoyed a substantial improvement in living standards.
While some jobs moved abroad, the net effect was still greatly positive.
The secret behind Sweden’s successful development, and hence people’s attitudes, is how the costs of change are distributed.
Official policy aims to reduce the cost of globalization for individuals, but never for companies.
Entrepreneurs need to face competition in order to develop, whereas individuals who are laid off may have difficulties getting back into productive work.
As trade minister of Sweden for most of this period, I never hindered or postponed import competition.
In the European Union, Sweden voted against almost all anti-dumping and other protectionist proposals. This never met any criticism from my voters, because educational policy and the social safety net were designed to lower workers’ risk aversion.
Broad educational policies equip an increasing share of Sweden’s population with basic education, thereby enhancing their employability.
Higher education is free of charge and accessible in all parts of the country.
But reaching one cohort per year is too little to meet demands in a fast-changing economy.
Therefore, on top of this, large resources are spent on modernizing the skills of those already in the labor force.
Social protection also has a broad, general nature.
In the Scandinavian countries, as opposed to, say, Germany and the US, the government, not individual companies, are responsible for most social benefits.
That way, economically irrational lock-in effects, whereby workers simply cannot afford to change jobs, are avoided.
Furthermore, benefits are generous enough to ensure that short periods of unemployment don’t force workers to sell their homes or even cars.
The system protects not only the unemployed, who can continue to pay their mortgages and interest, but also indirectly the banks, because their loans to households are repaid even in times of recession.
And, instead of solving all sorts of economically caused private problems, laid-off workers can concentrate on finding new and more future-oriented jobs.
No doubt, these policies are expensive.
But they pay for themselves by producing growth and revenues.
As the past decade shows, they have served the Scandinavian countries well during a period of extreme internationalization.
Instead of giving in to conventional wisdom, we have exploited the possibilities that globalization and technological change offer.
Could the Scandinavian model work for others?
At the very least, the Scandinavian example shows that politicians have more than one option to choose from when considering how to handle globalization.
Intense foreign competition and rapid technological change does not have to be a race to the bottom.
On the contrary, it can be compatible with rapidly rising real income and more and better jobs.

What Could Go Wrong in America?
CAMBRIDGE – Although the United States economy is in good shape – with essentially full employment and an inflation rate close to 2% – a world of uncertainty makes it worthwhile to consider what could go wrong in the year ahead.
After all, if the US economy runs into serious trouble, there will be adverse consequences for Europe, Japan, and many other countries.
Economic problems could of course originate from international political events.
Russia has been acting dangerously in Eastern and Central Europe.
China’s pursuit of territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, and its policies in East Asia more generally, is fueling regional uncertainty.
Events in Italy could precipitate a crisis in the eurozone.
But within the US, the greatest risk is a sharp decline in asset prices, which would squeeze households and firms, leading to a collapse of aggregate demand.
I am not predicting that this will happen.
But conditions are becoming more dangerous as asset prices rise further and further from historic norms.
Equity prices, as measured by the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 stocks, are now nearly 60% above their historical average.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond is so high that it implies a yield of about 2.3%; given current inflation expectations, the yield should be about twice as high.
Commercial real-estate prices have been rising at a 10% annual pace for the past five years.
These inflated asset prices reflect the exceptionally easy monetary policy that has prevailed for almost a decade.
In that ultra-low-interest environment, investors have been reaching for yield by bidding up the prices of equities and other investment assets.
The resulting increase in household wealth helped to bring about economic recovery; but overpriced assets are fostering an increasingly risky environment.
To grasp how risky, consider this: US households now own $21 trillion of equities, so a 35% decline in equity prices to their historic average would involve a loss of more than $7.5 trillion. Pension funds and other equity investors would incur further losses.
A return of real long-term bond yields to their historic level would involve a loss of about 30% for investors in 30-year bonds and proportionately smaller losses for investors in shorter-duration bonds.
Because commercial real-estate investments are generally highly leveraged, even relatively small declines in prices could cause large losses for investors.
The fall in household wealth would reduce spending and cause a decline in GDP.
A rough rule of thumb implies that every $100 decline in wealth leads to a $4 decline in household spending.
The return of asset prices to historic levels could therefore imply a decline of $400 billion in consumer spending, equal to about 2.5% of GDP, which would start a process of mutually reinforcing declines in incomes and spending leading to an even greater cumulative impact on GDP.
Because institutional investors respond to international differences in asset prices and asset yields, the large declines in US asset prices would be mirrored by similar declines in asset prices in other developed countries.
Those price declines would reduce incomes and spending in other countries, with the impact spread globally through reduced imports and exports.
I must emphasize that this process of asset-price declines and the resulting contraction of economic activity is a risk, not a prediction.
It is possible that asset prices will come down gradually, implying a slowdown rather than a collapse of spending and economic activity.
But the fear of triggering a rapid decline in asset prices is one of the key reasons why the US Federal Reserve is reluctant to raise short-term interest rates more rapidly.
The Fed increased the overnight rate by just 0.25% in December 2015 and is likely to add just another 25 basis points in December 2016.
But that will still leave the federal funds rate at less than 1%. With the inflation rate close to 2%, the real federal funds rate would still be negative.
Market participants are watching the Fed to judge if and when the process of interest-rate normalization will begin.
Historical experience implies that normalization would raise long-term interest rates by about two percentage points, precipitating substantial corrections in the prices of bonds, stocks, and commercial real estate. The Fed is therefore trying to tamp down expectations concerning future interest-rate levels, by suggesting that changes in demography and productivity trends imply lower real rates in the future.
If the Fed succeeds, the decline in asset prices may be diminished.
But the danger of sharp asset-price declines that precipitate an economic downturn should not be ignored.

NATO’s Dangerous Afghan Dream
NEW DELHI – The agreement at the NATO summit meeting in Lisbon on a transition plan to help end the war in Afghanistan within the next four years raises troubling questions about regional security and the global fight against transnational terrorism.
As the US and other coalition partners gradually wind down their combat role, Afghan security forces – to number 300,000 after crash training of new recruits – are to take their place.
But these local forces are unlikely to be able to hold the country together.
The most likely post-war scenario is a partition of Afghanistan, with the Taliban calling the shots in the Pashtun-dominated south and east, and the non-Pashtun northern and western regions retaining their current de facto autonomy.
Regionally, there is likely to be greater turmoil.
The withdrawal of NATO forces before the job is done will leave India on the front lines to face the brunt of greater terror from the Afghanistan-Pakistan belt.
In fact, NATO’s retreat is expected to embolden jihadists in the region – and beyond it – to stage transnational attacks.
The 2014 withdrawal plan, however, comes as no surprise, given US President Barack Obama’s expressed desire to end combat operations in Afghanistan.
Indeed, his defense secretary, Robert Gates, made clear last year that the US will now seek to contain terrorism regionally rather than defeat it.
The transition plan cements that strategic shift.
The problem, however, is that the US war effort is already faltering, with Afghan President Hamid Karzai exploring the possibility of cutting his own deals with the Taliban and other warlords.
And that is largely the result of Obama’s botched strategy, whose twin troop surges were designed not to rout the Taliban militarily, but to strike a political deal with them from a position of strength.
But, as CIA director Leon Panetta admitted, “We have seen no evidence that [the Taliban] are truly interested in reconciliation.”
Why would the Taliban be interested in negotiating a deal with the Americans, given Obama’s public declaration, just weeks after coming to office, that he was interested in a military exit from Afghanistan?
The Afghan Taliban and their sponsors, the Pakistan military, simply want to wait out the Americans.
Last year, with the stroke of his pen, Obama ended his predecessor’s “global war on terror.”
But renaming it a “struggle” or a “strategic challenge” has not changed the grim realities on the ground.
The US has been lucky to escape further terrorist strikes since September 11, 2001, despite several attempts.
By contrast, India’s location next to the Af-Pak has left it far more vulnerable, and the country has since suffered a series of major attacks – from the assault on its parliament in December 2001 to the terrorist siege of Mumbai in 2008.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, two artificially created states with no roots in history, have searched endlessly for a national identity. Today, they have emerged as the global epicenter of transnational terrorism and the heroin trade.
Although Pakistan is now the largest recipient of US aid in the world, the Failed States Index2010, created by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace, ranks the country 10th, between Guinea and Haiti.
Unlike in other failed states, however, in Pakistan state-nurtured terrorism and state-supported nuclear smuggling uniquely intersect.
To compound the situation, the political border between Afghanistan and Pakistan has now ceased to exist in practice.
The 2,640-kilometer Durand Line, a British-colonial invention that divided the large Pashtun community when it was established in 1893 as the border between British-led India and Afghanistan, has long been despised and rejected by Afghanistan.
Today, the Durand Line exists only on maps.
On the ground, it has little political, ethnic, or economic relevance, even as the Af-Pak region has become a magnet for the world’s jihadists.
A de facto Pashtunistan, long sought by Pashtuns, has now grown up on the ruins of an ongoing Islamist militancy, but without any political authority in charge.
The disappearance of the Af-Pak political border seems irreversible, undermining Pakistan’s own territorial integrity.
Yet, as if the forces of terror could be neatly boxed in, the US has scaled back its objective to contain terrorism regionally – a strategy that promises to keep the Af-Pak problem a festering threat to global security.
Indeed, NATO’s withdrawal plan is likely to lead to a realignment of ethnic forces, and thus to greater volatility.
Afghanistan is not Vietnam.
A withdrawal of US and other NATO troops will not mean the end of the war, because the enemy will continue to target Western interests, wherever they may be.
The hope that terrorism can be regionally contained is a dangerous exercise in self-delusion.

South Africa's Corruption Nemesis
JOHANNESBURG – On January 2, South Africans woke up to the news that the country’s parliament building was on fire.
Just days later came the release of an 800-page report detailing rampant corruption and poor governance in South Africa.
Then, several glass doors and windows were shattered at the Constitutional Court.
It was an ominous start to the year for a country still mourning the loss of its “moral compass,” Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The report – the first of three expected from the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, known as the Zondo Commission after its chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo – confirmed what was long suspected: State capture is rampant in South Africa.
Systemic political corruption benefited the influential Gupta family, for example, as well as a range of facilitators in the country’s civil service and ministries.
The report reveals patterns of abuse at almost every stage of public procurement.
When professionals in government departments or state-owned enterprises resisted, they were replaced with more compliant officials.
In the commission’s view, South Africa needs an independent anti-corruption agency that can perform its functions without fear or favor.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who campaigned on a promise to fight corruption and improve governance, has declared that the Zondo Commission’s findings should be used to help the country reform its institutions and hold those responsible to account.
“We must ensure that we use [the findings] to safeguard these institutions into the future so that they may never be captured again,” Ramaphosa wrote in his weekly newsletter.
But statements from other members of the ruling party, the African National Congress, were not as resolute.
Speaking to community and religious leaders in a rural province shortly after the release of the report, Deputy President David Mabuza was evasive on the steps government would take.
“We are committed to do a thorough reflection, and we are going to change,” he said.
But “reflection” could fall short of accountability. ANC National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe has said that he opposes using the report to prosecute party leaders.
The ANC’s stance, coupled with weakened state institutions, has led to skepticism about the government’s ability and will to act meaningfully on the report’s recommendations.
The mixed reactions to the commission’s report must be viewed in the context of the ANC’s internal battles. As the party prepares for its National Elective Conference in December, factional infighting is more pronounced than ever.
Ramaphosa, who is expected to run for a second term as party leader, faces stiff competition from the Radical Economic Transformation faction, and will need to balance his political aspirations, the needs of the party, and the long-term interests of the country.
It will be difficult to implement the recommendations of the report without doing permanent damage to the ANC’s reputation.
Moreover, South Africa’s constitutional democracy faces threats beyond the corruption revealed by the Zondo Commission.
As the report notes: “State capture aggressively attacked a system which was already weakened by longstanding comorbidities,” including high levels of inequality, poverty, and unemployment.
Given this state of affairs, the events of early January, like the riots and looting last July, should come as no surprise.
While they may not have been part of a coordinated effort to destabilize the country, they are clear symptoms of democratic decay.
Some have seemed to embrace the disease.
In a recent commentary, Lindiwe Sisulu, the minister for tourism and a member of parliament since 1994, questioned the benefits of the “rule of law” and called the country’s constitution a “palliative” for the poor.
Sisulu’s comments were denounced as a further attack on South Africa’s democratic institutions.
But it is true that the political freedoms contained in the constitution were meant to be accompanied by measures to reduce economic inequality, which is the world’s highest.
Twenty-eight years of democratic rule have brought negligible progress on this front.
The constitution represents a social contract among all South Africans.
The democracy it envisions requires the support of ordinary citizens and political leaders alike.
But the rights it guarantees depend largely on the state.
In February, South Africa faced a second assessment by the African Peer Review Mechanism, a voluntary arrangement established by African Union members, on the state of its governance.
This evaluation suggested credible reforms, offering another opportunity to reflect on the serious problems that have come to light.
South Africa needs bold and decisive action to restore confidence in institutions like the National Prosecuting Authority, to professionalize the civil service, and to strengthen transparency norms.
The constitution’s ideals must be put into practice.
A good way to start would be to act conscientiously on the recommendations of the Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture.

What’s a President to Do?
SEOUL – Donald Trump took office promising a raft of sweeping economic-policy changes for the United States.
He has quickly discovered, like previous US presidents, that America’s political system is designed to prevent rapid, large-scale change, by interposing formidable institutional obstacles, from the Congress and career civil servants to state governments and the courts.
Start with reform of personal income tax.
This should be a slam-dunk, because the president and congressional Republican leaders are on the same page.
Trump’s goal of removing the government’s groping hand from Americans’ pockets, by cutting the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income from 39.5% to 33%, is entirely consistent with mainstream Republican ideology, according to which high tax rates penalize success and stifle innovation.
But, to be politically viable, significant tax cuts for the wealthy would have to be accompanied by at least token tax cuts for the middle class.
And broad-based tax cuts would blow a hole in the budget and excite congressional deficit hawks, of whom there are still a few.
One can imagine closing loopholes to render rate cuts revenue neutral. But one person’s loophole is another’s entitlement.
Even if there are economic arguments for eliminating, say, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, imagine the howls of protest from homeowners, including many Trump voters, who borrowed to purchase their houses.
Imagine the reaction of Trump’s friends in real estate.
Cuts on the spending side would assuage the deficit hawks.
And big cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Agency for International Development, and National Public Radio are high on the Republican hit list.
But the vast majority of federal spending is on entitlements, the military, and other proverbial “third rail” items that elected officials touch at their peril. Simply put, broad-based spending cuts to match broad-based income-tax reductions are not politically feasible.
Eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) would save the government a little over $100 billion a year, about 3% of federal spending.
But those subsidies are largely paid for by their own dedicated taxes. Moreover, Trump and congressional Republicans are learning that replacing Obamacare is easier said than done.
Health-care reform, as Hillary Clinton could have told them, is fearsomely complex.
It is increasingly clear that the name will change (“Trumpcare,” anyone?), and it can be expected that the Republican plan will cover fewer people; but much of the substance will remain the same.
Because corporate taxes are less significant in terms of overall federal revenue, rate cutting doesn’t pose a comparable threat to the budget balance.
But here there is no agreement between Congress and the Trump administration on the form such cuts should take.
House Speaker Paul Ryan and others favor moving to a border adjustment tax that would tax corporate cash flows regardless of where the goods sold by US companies are produced, while exempting exports.
Others, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are evidently skeptical.
And an important part of Trump’s business constituency – import-dependent retailers like Target and Walmart – are actively hostile.
Agreement on a plan won’t come easily.
Trump’s other flagship proposal is a $1 trillion infrastructure program.
But this initiative will run headlong into deficit concerns, and it is fundamentally at odds with Republican skepticism about big government, and specifically about the public sector’s capacity to carry out investment plans efficiently.
Trump will want to be able to point to a few signature projects.
He will want his border wall with Mexico.
But any new federal infrastructure spending is likely to be more symbolic than real.
So what will an impatient president, frustrated and hemmed in on all sides, do?
First, Trump will focus on the one set of economic policies a president can pursue without close congressional cooperation, namely those affecting trade.
He can invoke the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, restricting imports on the grounds that they threaten US “material interests.”
He can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 on the grounds that the loss of jobs to Mexico and China constitutes an economic emergency.
He can even invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 on the grounds that the US has Special Forces active in the Middle East.
Second, Trump will respond, as populists do, by attempting to distract attention from his failure to deliver the economic goods.
This means directing his ire and that of his supporters toward others – whether internal enemies like the press, the intelligence community, and Barack Obama, or external adversaries like the Islamic State and China.
It wouldn’t be the first time a politician used a domestic political crusade or a foreign policy adventure to divert attention from his economic failures.
We have already seen Trump’s tendency to lash out at perceived enemies, foreign and domestic.
And we know that this confrontational style is the modus operandi of senior White House advisers like Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller.
We can hope that cooler heads prevail.
But, given the constraints on implementing Trump’s economic agenda, it’s hard to be optimistic.

Globalizing the Fight Against the Pandemic
SAN JOSÉ – The COVID-19 pandemic began less than six months ago, but we have already learned a great deal about the disease.
Scientists around the world are looking at new and improved methods of detecting the novel coronavirus as early as possible.
And in addition to these lines of inquiry, there are already eight potential vaccines under clinical evaluation, and more than 100 vaccine candidates in preclinical stages.
All of this represents extraordinary progress that we should celebrate.
But there is reason to worry that not everyone will benefit from these breakthroughs.
Developing tests, treatments, and vaccines for the coronavirus is only half the battle.
The other half – what might be the hardest part – is to manufacture, distribute, and administer enough of these life-saving tools to benefit everyone, everywhere.
Early on in the pandemic, Costa Rica and the World Health Organization began discussing the creation of a one-stop shop for data, knowledge, and intellectual property relating to diagnostics, medicines, vaccines, and any other tools that may work against COVID-19.
As of May 29, this visionary idea has become a reality with the launch of the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool, which will ensure that progress leaves no one behind.
When effectively managed, open and global research produces results much faster than individual efforts can.
The WHO’s own “Solidarity Trial” to find a COVID-19 treatment follows the same principle and is already collecting randomized data from 17 countries, with more than 100 others either getting involved or inquiring about joining. The WHO is also supporting 60 countries on related issues such as regulation, ethics, and the procurement of trial drugs, in recognition of the fact that the more countries participate, the sooner we will get results.
An open framework built around voluntarily shared information is not just good for science.
It also will maximize the number of companies involved in producing in-demand technologies, thereby scaling up worldwide availability, lowering costs, and helping secure universal access.
Equitable access is a key ingredient of the antidote to COVID-19.
Vaccines or treatments – no matter how effective – will fail to end the pandemic unless they benefit everyone.
Until everyone is protected, the world will remain at risk.
We applaud the United Kingdom for its commitment to make vaccines available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost, as part of its £84 million ($103 million) funding pledge for research at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.
We also agree with French President Emmanuel Macron, who has made a compelling case for why every COVID-19 treatment or vaccine produced in the Global North should be made accessible immediately in the Global South, prioritizing synchronization over sequencing.
When a COVID-19 vaccine does become available, it should be treated as a global public good.
To that end, we are both calling on all governments to ensure that the outcomes of publicly funded COVID-19 research are affordable, available, and accessible to everyone around the world.
We also invite the pharmaceutical industry and relevant research institutions to share knowledge, data, and viable discoveries through the new access pool, so that companies large and small can join the global collective effort.
Bringing more companies into the mix will expand the pool of knowledge and diversify how it is applied, increasing the odds of effective solutions being developed and delivered to more people in more places, and in less time.
Overcoming COVID-19 will require unprecedented breakthroughs in technological innovation and human collaboration.
Fortunately, many countries are already coming together to realize a shared vision of health for all.
For example, both the United Nations General Assembly and the World Health Assembly have passed resolutions in support of universal, timely, and equitable access to health technologies.
Private and philanthropic health leaders have been joined by 11 heads of state to support the launch of the WHO’s Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which also places special emphasis on access.
And funders from around the world are now preparing their pledges for the upcoming Global Vaccine Summit on June 4.
With the launch of the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool, we hope to complement years of work by the Medicines Patent Pool in negotiating for voluntary licenses on pharmaceuticals.
This work has helped to deliver drugs for HIV, tuberculosis, and hepatitis C around the world.
But even more global solidarity is required to meet the current crisis.
All pharmaceutical and technological innovators should ensure that their discoveries become beacons of hope for everyone, not just for the wealthiest individuals and countries.
Combating COVID-19 calls for a global arsenal, and every tool that proves effective must be included.

America’s Debilitating Middle-East Obsession
NEW DELHI – “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” US President Donald Trump declared in his 2019 State of the Union speech.
He had a point: military entanglements in the Middle East have contributed to the relative decline of American power and facilitated China’s muscular rise.
And yet, less than a year after that speech, Trump ordered the assassination of Iran’s most powerful military commander, General Qassem Suleimani, bringing the United States to the precipice of yet another war.
Such is the power of America’s addiction to interfering in the chronically volatile Middle East.
The US no longer has vital interests at stake in the Middle East.
Shale oil and gas have made the US energy independent, so safeguarding Middle Eastern oil supplies is no longer a strategic imperative.
In fact, the US has been supplanting Iran as an important source of crude oil and petroleum products for India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer after America and China.
Moreover, Israel, which has become the region’s leading military power (and its only nuclear-armed state), no longer depends on vigilant US protection.
The US does, however, have a vital interest in resisting China’s efforts to challenge international norms, including through territorial and maritime revisionism.
That is why Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, promised a “pivot to Asia” early in his presidency.
But Obama failed to follow through on his plans to shift America’s foreign-policy focus from the Middle East.
On the contrary, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate staged military campaigns everywhere from Syria and Iraq to Somalia and Yemen.
In Libya, his administration sowed chaos by overthrowing strongman Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011.
In Egypt, Obama hailed President Hosni Mubarak’s 2011 ouster.
Yet in 2013, when the military toppled Mubarak’s democratically elected successor, Mohamed Morsi, Obama opted for non-intervention, refusing to acknowledge it as a coup, and suspended US aid only briefly.
This reflected the Obama administration’s habit of selective non-intervention – the approach that encouraged China, America’s main long-term rival, to become more aggressive in pursuit of its claims in the South China Sea, including building and militarizing seven artificial islands.
Trump was supposed to change this.
He has repeatedly derided US military interventions in the Middle East as a colossal waste of money, claiming the US has spent $7 trillion since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
(Brown University’s Costs of War Project puts the figure at $6.4 trillion.)
“We have nothing – nothing except death and destruction.
It’s a horrible thing,” Trump said in 2018.
Furthermore, the Trump administration’s national-security strategy recognizes China as a “strategic competitor” – a label that it subsequently replaced with the far blunter “enemy.”
And it has laid out a strategy for curbing Chinese aggression and creating a “free and open” Indo-Pacific region stretching “from Bollywood to Hollywood.”
Yet, as is so often the case, Trump’s actions have directly contradicted his words.
Despite his anti-war rhetoric, Trump appointed war-mongering aides like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been described as a “hawk brimming with bravado and ambition,” and former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who in 2015 wrote an op-ed called “To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran.”
Perhaps it should be no surprise, then, that Trump has pursued a needlessly antagonistic approach to Iran.
The escalation began early in his presidency, when he withdrew the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (which Iran had not violated), re-imposed sanctions, and pressured America’s allies to follow suit.
Furthermore, since last May, Trump has deployed 16,500 additional troops to the Middle East and sent an aircraft-carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf, instead of the South China Sea.
The assassination of Suleimani was part of this pattern.
Like virtually all of America’s past interventions in the Middle East, its Iran policy has been spectacularly counterproductive. Iran has announced that it will disregard the nuclear agreement’s uranium-enrichment limits.
Trump’s sanctions have increased the oil-import bill of US allies like India and deepened Iran’s ties with China, which has continued to import Iranian oil through private companies and invest billions of dollars in Iran’s oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors.
Beyond Iran, Trump has failed to extricate the US from Afghanistan, Syria, or Yemen.
His administration has continued to support the Saudi-led bombing campaign against Yemen’s Houthi rebels with US military raids and sorties.
As a result, Yemen is enduring the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
Trump did order troops to leave Syria last October, but with so little strategic planning that the Kurds – America’s most loyal ally in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) – were left exposed to an attack from Turkey. This, together with his effort to strike a Faustian bargain with the Afghan Taliban (which is responsible for the world’s deadliest terrorist attacks), threatens to reverse his sole achievement in the Middle East: dramatically diminishing ISIS’s territorial holdings.
Making matters worse, after ordering the Syrian drawdown, Trump approved a military mission to secure the country’s oil fields.
The enduring oil fixation also led Trump last April to endorse Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar, just as Haftar began laying siege to the capital, Tripoli.
The Trump administration is unlikely to change course any time soon.
In fact, it has now redefined the Indo-Pacific region as extending “from California to Kilimanjaro,” thus specifically including the Persian Gulf.
With this change, the Trump administration is attempting to uphold the pretense that its interventions in the Middle East serve US foreign-policy goals, even when they undermine those goals.
As long as the US remains mired in “endless wars” in the Middle East, it will be unable to address in a meaningful way the threat China poses.
Trump was supposed to know this.
And yet, his administration’s commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific seems likely to lose credibility, while the cycle of self-defeating American interventionism in the Middle East appears set to continue.

Saving Afghanistan Despite the Taliban
WASHINGTON, DC – The Afghan economy is in free fall.
Public-sector employees –teachers, health-care workers, bureaucrats, police – are not being paid, the currency has lost a fifth of its value, and shortages of food, medicines, and everyday products are growing.
Even when these items are available, many households cannot afford to buy them.
It was inevitable that the country’s takeover by the Taliban and the withdrawal of American and allied forces would leave most Afghans economically worse off and personally less free.
Still, few anticipated the speed and scale of the humanitarian catastrophe now taking shape.
While the international community decides how to calibrate its response – or if it should respond at all – life in Afghanistan is becoming more difficult.
Aid flows, which financed 75% of the country’s national budget before the Taliban seized power, have mostly dried up.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have halted their substantial funding.
Afghanistan’s $7 billion of reserves in the United States have been frozen by President Joe Biden’s administration.
And fear of violating sanctions has stopped banks and businesses from engaging even in permitted activities.
In addition, education and health programs risk closure – not because of decisions by the new government, but because they have no money.
This, too reflects the international community’s indecision about how best to approach Afghanistan under the Taliban.
On one side, there are calls to respond urgently to the humanitarian crisis and continue to work to preserve the gains of the past two decades in human development, especially for women and girls.
For this to happen, aid and trade need to keep flowing, and the international community must engage with the country’s new leaders. A small subset of this group would go further, arguing that the international community must accept the reality of the new government and work with it more broadly, just as it does with many other governments that represent objectionable policies and behavior.
On the other side are those who start from the premise that Afghanistan is now ruled by a party that has taken power by force.
Moreover, the Taliban’s values and policies are fundamentally at odds with what the international community has promoted for the last two decades, and its early actions hold little promise of a smooth future relationship.
For this camp, any action that helps bolster the popularity or effectiveness of the Taliban’s government, even as a collateral effect, crosses a red line.
Those who are reluctant to provide aid want to be sure that any funds given to Afghanistan are not diverted to general expenditures that strengthen the new government.
They also want to ensure that easing access to funding is matched by positive actions from the Afghan leadership.
These are valid points, but they will not convince the 23 million Afghans at risk of starvation as the harsh winter approaches.
As images of widespread hunger force Afghanistan back into the global spotlight, the calls to increase financial support will be hard to resist.
Those calls will be stronger if even a small fraction of desperate Afghans vote with their feet and trigger a new, massive refugee crisis.
For some perspective, consider that nearly a third of Syria’s pre-civil war population of 20 million became refugees, with an additional third internally displaced.
Afghanistan’s population is close to 40 million.
The consequences of an imploding Afghanistan, with or without Taliban leadership, will not be contained within the country’s insecure and porous borders.
At a minimum, Afghanistan’s neighbors will feel the effects of its economic, security, and humanitarian crises – and they are not well positioned to manage these challenges.
Careful, considered work to loosen financial restrictions needs to start now, taking into account some consequential trade-offs.
Two actions could provide near-term, targeted relief.
First, the US Treasury needs to clarify the scope and operation of financial sanctions for humanitarian and development work and to broaden the range of permitted activities.
The Treasury should apply to Afghanistan the lessons from its own review of sanctions programs, which calls for greater precision and better targeting to avoid unintended consequences for civilian populations.
Second, the international community should allow a limited, monitored release of Afghanistan’s frozen reserves to pay for essential imports of food, fuel, and medicine.
Access could start small and be audited independently, with an option to terminate in the event of misuse.
Both of these proposals can be implemented relatively quickly, and both have recent precedents – specifically, in relations with Venezuela and Yemen.
When faced with difficult choices, there is a natural tendency to delay.
These targeted measures will, of course, attract criticism from both those who think they fall short and those who believe they go too far.
But opting for a middle path now is unambiguously better than delaying a decision in the hope that a more attractive option will emerge.

Is America Going Fascist?
CAMBRIDGE – White nationalism is on the rise in the United States.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were 6,768 incidents of extremism and anti-Semitism (mostly from the right) in the US in 2018 and 2019.
That figure is significantly higher than in previous years, leading many to conclude that President Donald Trump is to blame for the uptick in domestic extremism.
Since the launch of his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has overtly and covertly encouraged violence by his supporters.
After a white supremacist, James Alex Fields Jr., drove his car into counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring dozens, Trump infamously said that there were “some very fine people on both sides.”
And he has not shied away from racist rhetoric when describing African countries and even non-white members of Congress.
Trump’s words have consequences.
In addition to the Charlottesville killer, several other high-profile white nationalists who have carried out acts of violence or domestic terrorism have said that they were inspired by the president.
These include Cesar Sayoc Jr., who mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton; Robert Bowers, who killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue; and Patrick Crusius, who gunned down 22 people in El Paso. New research by economists Karsten Müller of Princeton University and Carlo Schwarz of Warwick University draws a direct causal link between Trump’s anti-Muslim tweets and anti-Muslim hate crimes.
Owing to Trump’s propensity to foment violence and distort the truth, many have concluded that he is a fascist.
Most ominously, Trump seeks to delegitimize democratic institutions and impartial bureaucratic procedures, not only to insulate his and his family’s dubious business dealings, but as a strategy to increase his personal power and authority.
Italian fascists and the Nazis routinely used similar strategies from the 1920s onward.
But it would be a mistake to exaggerate these similarities.
For starters, interwar fascism cannot be understood without the foil of communism, which many middle-class Germans and Italians considered an existential threat.
There is no such threat today.
Obama’s election as America’s first black president did reinforce extremists’ fears that America’s white population is being “replaced.”
But such conspiracy theories cannot be compared to the real-world threat posed by communism following Russia’s Bolshevik revolution in 1917.
Second, in the post-World War I era, traumatized, disillusioned, and battle-hardened young men comprised a significant share of many countries’ population.
While many veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered similar traumas (and some are staunch Trump supporters), they command neither the numbers nor the political influence that their interwar counterparts did.
Third, despite his rhetoric and attempts to enlist the help of other countries in his re-election campaign, Trump has not yet tried to consolidate his power by non-electoral means.
That could change if he loses to the Democratic challenger in November.
But even then, it would be a far cry from past fascists’ systematic undermining of democratic processes.
Lastly, while the Republican Party’s unconditional support for Trump is eerily similar to the behavior of center-right politicians who backed Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, there is nothing uniquely fascist about unprincipled politicians behaving dishonorably.
This is important, because it really does matter whether one calls Trump a fascist, as opposed to applying some other label.
To be sure, a second Trump term would represent an existential crisis for American institutions.
The forces that have hampered his agenda – most critically, mobilized citizens – would become less powerful as his rule became further normalized.
Political conventions would be even more radically undermined than in Trump’s first term.
The administration’s ongoing effort to abolish impartial expertise from the bureaucracy would continue unabated.
The political system, including the judiciary, could become irreparably polarized.
But partisan polarization and the decimation of any middle ground for compromise are key weapons in Trump’s own war against the institutions that are meant to keep him in check.
Those who brand him and his supporters as fascists are merely deepening the divide, and delegitimizing the (often valid) grievances of millions of Americans, most of whom have nothing to do with white nationalism or extremism.
The most promising strategies for resisting and defeating Trump are nothing like those required to fight twentieth-century fascist movements.
Once Mussolini and Hitler took power, there simply was no way to stop them by working within the system.
By contrast, the most effective way to combat Trump is through the ballot box, as demonstrated by the 2018 midterm congressional elections, when Democrats trounced Republicans to retake the House of Representatives.
The best way forward, then, is with a two-pronged strategy.
First, Democrats (and all other interested parties) need to find a better way to communicate with the millions who voted for Trump because they felt – and, in many cases, truly were – left behind economically and ignored politically.
Any movement that turns its back on these Americans not only reduces its own chances of winning political power, but also deepens the polarization that has allowed Trump to act with near carte blanche.
Yes, most Trump supporters will not readily switch to the Democratic nominee in 2020. But it is nonetheless critical that Democratic candidates recognize these constituents’ concerns and start building bridges to them.
Second, the Democrats must win decisively.
Otherwise, Trump and his supporters will claim that the election was stolen from them.
An overwhelming Democratic victory is needed to signal to the country that most Americans oppose Trump’s destructive agenda, disrespect for US political institutions, and polarizing rhetoric.
It is not too late to address Americans’ grievances and rebuild the country’s institutions.
But that won’t be possible in a politically polarized environment, and charges of fascism will merely make that environment less hospitable to Trump’s opponents.

Who Beats Corruption?
Corruption undermines the quality of life for people around the world, not only in poor countries.
The US currently is witnessing several corruption scandals. Even America’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man-made catastrophes, was in the hands of inept political cronies rather than professionals.
When hurricane Katrina struck America’s Gulf Coast, that incompetence proved fatal.
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure.
Thus, governments are invested with unique powers, especially the powers of policing and judicial control.
But these powers are also readily abused.
How, then, to ensure that governments are law-abiding as well as strong?
The best answer, both in theory and practice, is to find ways to hold governments accountable to the people that they serve.
Elections are obviously one method, though campaign financing can be a source of corruption.
Politicians around the world trade favors for cash needed to win elections, and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people.
Clear electoral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency, but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections.
Privately owned newspapers, independent radio and television networks, trade unions, churches, professional societies, and other groups within civil society provide a bulwark against despotism.
In the poorest countries, where illiteracy is high, desperate people are subject to government manipulation, and there is a lack of independent control through the media and professional organizations, governments face only weak control by society.
They tend to be the most despotic and corrupt, not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary, their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding.
The result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty – a two-way spiral downward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government, lacking computers, telephones, information systems, and trained civil servants, couldn’t function honestly even if it wanted to.
The end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy, as in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Somalia.
One measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by Transparency International, an organization dedicated to strengthening civil society in the fight against government corruption.
Transparency International produces an annual ranking of “corruption perceptions,” measuring the public’s view of the extent of corruption in a country.
In the 2005 rankings, Iceland scored as the least corrupt country, with the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand, and Singapore close behind.
The US ranked seventeenth from the top, a not-so-glorious position for the world’s leading power.
In general, the poorer the country, the lower the ranking: tied for last place are Chad and Bangladesh.
A bit of statistical analysis reveals further important patterns.
First, Sub-Saharan African countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world.
For example, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam.
Yet the Asian countries’ economies have tended to grow much faster over the past generation.
Corruption therefore cannot be the unique factor that holds Africa back.
Africa’s problems have more to do with droughts, malaria, AIDS, and lack of infrastructure.
Poor countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protected.
When people have the freedom to assemble, to speak, and to publish their views, society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are debated, but also by keeping corruption in check.
It is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press, trade unions, and on professional associations.
In Africa, less corrupt countries like Ghana also have much better protection of civil liberties than more corruption-prone countries like Chad and Ethiopia, which are also even poorer.
Finally, the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas-producing countries.
In general, natural resources like oil, gas, diamonds, and other precious minerals breed corruption, because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to “compromise” with their own societies.
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power.
Many foreign companies, intent on cashing in, fuel the pathology of corrupt regimes by peddling in bribes and political protection.
The implications for action are clear.
By strengthening civil society – through legal rights and long-term economic development – and instituting clear rules to ensure accountability, political despotism and corruption will be brought under control.
We should be uncompromising, therefore, in our defense of civil liberties.
The rich world should offer impoverished regions like sub-Saharan Africa more economic support to break out of poverty.
Of course, aid should be directed to specific needs – for example, malaria control, food production, safe drinking water, and sanitation – whose fulfillment can be measured and monitored to resist corruption.
By raising living standards, we would also be empowering both civil society and impoverished governments to defend the rule of law.

Socrates in Silicon Valley
LONDON – If Socrates’s gadfly was in Silicon Valley, it would have a lot of lazy horses to sting.
The citizens of the techno-polis appear oblivious to how the outside world’s perception of them has changed, and radically so.
Once universally revered as a hotbed of innovation, the world’s premier technology hub is increasingly viewed with suspicion and resentment.
Yes, Silicon Valley is still admired as a source of invention and creative destruction; but it is also widely viewed as having lost its ethical compass.
With proliferating reports of lax attitudes toward data privacy, wanton disregard for the dignity of the less fortunate, and a growing sense that technology companies are pushing their preferred policy agenda on the rest of the world, discontent and disillusion are rising.
Viewed from outside, the world sees companies that exude a sense of entitlement – for example, by flouting local regulations as they expand into cities around the world, from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro.
Supremely confident in the power of their knowledge and skills, they are convinced that they will guide the world onto the Path of Truth.
This overweening certitude is not new – the United States, after all, was founded on missionary zeal – but the ethical arrogance is.
Of course, not all technology companies should be tarred with the same brush as the main offenders.
But the recent spate of high-profile cases harms the reputation of the sector as a whole.
As the world looks to Silicon Valley and sees an echo chamber of self-righteous conceit, mature and law-abiding technology companies are assumed to be inside it, too.
The cases are becoming legion.
Uber, the data-abusing car-sharing app that spikes prices during peak demand and threatens journalists who write negatively about it, has been banned in Spain, the Netherlands, Thailand, and two Indian cities so far, including New Delhi (after a driver allegedly raped a passenger).
These reports follow the revelation that pictures shared on Snapchat may not be deleted, as promised.
In August, Brazilian authorities banned the social-networking app Secret after the company failed to respond to cyberbullying concerns, with Israel considering a similar move.
The list goes on.
Silicon Valley is risking a backlash that will not do anyone any good.
Its leaders are increasingly out of step with the public’s expectation of ethical and conscientious behavior.
If they fail to generate new ideas and devise novel approaches, their problems will only multiply further.
One thing that would help is fresh blood.
Much of Silicon Valley’s success stems from its tight networks – people who have been successful and support one another.
But history shows that the same structures can also choke off innovation.
Organizations, like species, become inbred and weak, and eventually perish, when they fail to embrace diversity.
Indeed, one of the most revealing facts to come to light about Silicon Valley in recent months is the extreme ethnic and gender imbalance at large technology companies, including Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
No one is shocked, but clearly something needs to change.
Somehow a place that prides itself on innovation and doing things differently should be doing this differently as well.
Above all, there is value in questioning and challenging the status quo.
Independence in thought and deed is vital for any company to function and to build things that last and contribute to economic growth and prosperity.
In Plato’s Apology, Socrates advocates for the examined life – the habit of rigorous self-reflection and posing hard, heterodox, and possibly upsetting questions.
The tech sector needs to embrace that credo.
Ironically, questioning prevailing wisdom – and thereby inventing radically new solutions – has been Silicon Valley’s modus operandi from the outset.
But it has followed this approach on a macro level and for problems elsewhere in the economy, without examining itself.
Silicon Valley’s citizens must start applying their skill at innovation – and their pride in “breaking things” – to themselves.
The only way to evolve is by adapting to new environmental pressures, and now Silicon Valley – owing in large part to its own behavior – is facing plenty of them.
Unless it changes, it will be overtaken.
The good news is that if any place has proved that it can innovate, it is Silicon Valley.
Now, however, its citizens must recognize that they do not have all the answers; unfortunately, so far at least, there seems to be no awareness among them that there is even a problem.
Like the “skilled craftsmen” described by Socrates, “on the strength of their technical proficiency, they claimed a perfect understanding of every other subject, however important.”
As Plato’s teacher knew – and as every fresh report of the tech sector’s abusive behavior should remind us – a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.

The Fear Factor in US-China Relations
Opinion polls indicate that one-third of Americans believe that China will “soon dominate the world,” while nearly half view China’s emergence as a “threat to world peace.”
In turn, many Chinese fear that the United States will not accept their “peaceful rise.”
Americans and Chinese must avoid such exaggerated fears.
Maintaining good US-China relations will be a key determinant of global stability in this century.
Perhaps the greatest threat to the bilateral relationship is the belief that conflict is inevitable.
Throughout history, whenever a rising power creates fear among its neighbors and other great powers, that fear becomes a cause of conflict.
In such circumstances, seemingly small events can trigger an unforeseen and disastrous chain reaction.
Today, the greatest prospect of a destabilizing incident lies in the complex relationships across the Taiwan Strait.
China, which regards Taiwan as an integral part of its territory that has sheltered behind the US navy since the days of the Chinese civil war, vows that any Taiwanese declaration of independence will be met by force.
The US does not challenge China’s sovereignty, but it wants a peaceful settlement that will maintain Taiwan’s democratic institutions.
In Taiwan itself, there is a growing sense of national identity, but a sharp division between pragmatists of the “pan-blue alliance,” who realize that geography will require them to find a compromise with the mainland, and the ruling “pan-green alliance,” which aspires in varying degrees to achieve independence.
The two sides in Taiwan will face off in a presidential election on March 22.
Current polls suggest that former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT) leads Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
But some observers fear that the incumbent DPP President Chen Shui-bian will seek a pretext to prevent a defeat for the pro-sovereignty camp.
He is currently advocating a referendum on whether Taiwan should join the United Nations, which China views as provocative.
Chen replies that it is China “that is acting provocatively today.”
America is clearly concerned.
Recently, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a news conference that “we think that Taiwan’s referendum to apply to the UN under the name ‘Taiwan’ is a provocative policy.
It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait and it promises no real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage.”
She also reiterated the administration policy opposing “unilateral threat by either side to change the status quo.”
The same day, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized China for unexpectedly curtailing American ship visits to Chinese ports because of American arms sales to Taiwan.
According to Gates, he had told Chinese officials that American arms sales were consistent with past policy and that “as long as they continued to build up their forces on their side of the Taiwan Strait, we would continue to give Taiwan the resources necessary to defend itself.”
Gates added, however, that despite China’s rising defense budget, “I don’t consider China an enemy, and I think there are opportunities for continued cooperation in a number of areas.”
In principle, the Taiwan issue need not lead to conflict.
With increasing change in China and growing economic and social contacts across the strait, it should be possible to find a formula that allows the Taiwanese to maintain their market economy and democratic system without a placard at the UN.
Thus far, the US has tried to allow for this evolution by stressing two bright lines: no independence for Taiwan and no use of force by China.
But, given the danger of incidents that could grow out of political competition in Taiwan or growing impatience in the Peoples’ Liberation Army on the mainland, the US would be wise to encourage more active contacts and negotiations by the two sides.
The US has a broad national interest in maintaining good relations with China, as well as a specific human rights interest in protecting Taiwan’s democracy.
The US does not have a national interest in helping Taiwan become a sovereign country with a seat at the UN, and efforts by some Taiwanese to do so present the greatest danger of a miscalculation that could create enmity between the US and China.
Already, some Chinese suspect the US of seeking an independent Taiwan as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” for use against a future Chinese enemy. They are wrong, but such suspicions can feed a climate of enmity.
If America treats China as an enemy today, it will ensure future enmity.
While we cannot be sure how China will evolve, it makes no sense to foreclose the prospect of a better future.
America’s current policy combines economic integration with a hedge against future uncertainty.
The US-Japan security alliance means China cannot play a “Japan card.”
But, while such hedging is natural in world politics, modesty is important for both sides.
If the overall climate is one of distrust, what looks like a hedge to one side can look like a threat to the other.
There is no need for the US and China to go to war in this century.
Both sides must take care that an incident concerning Taiwan does not lead in that direction.
Americans and Chinese must avoid letting exaggerated fears create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The Conservative Without Qualities
PRINCETON – The satirist Karl Kraus observed about his native Austria in 1899: “When the constitution is violated, the people just yawn.” How upset Austrians really were last week when Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was accused of corruption is unclear.
But the charges – and the public leaks of vulgar chats involving Kurz and his colleagues – were serious enough to prompt his always somewhat unlikely coalition partner, the Greens, to bring him down.
Kurz’s fall is widely seen as having consequences beyond Austria: his approach had been touted as a model for center-right parties across Europe, especially in Germany, where the Christian Democrats are currently in disarray after their dramatic election loss last month.
But “Kurzism” has been all about style and tactics, not new political ideas or, for that matter, a sustainable alliance of social forces.
Worse, Kurz’s model is downright dangerous for democracy.
Just 35 years old, Kurz has the distinction of having been ex-chancellor twice already.
He was always the youngest and fastest: foreign minister at 27, chancellor at 31.
He was also fast when it came to switching political positions: initially liberal, he turned hardliner on matters of immigration and refugee policy, in effect copying and mainstreaming the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).
In 2017, he entered a coalition with the FPÖ.
When a similar government had been formed in Austria in 2000, it set off alarm bells across Europe.
This time, with Hungary and Poland having since pioneered the autocratization of EU member states, the creation of the Kurz coalition elicited only yawns.
Mainstreaming the far right has been a general trend across Europe, owing partly to the fact that center-right parties are bereft of ideas.
For many years, the conventional wisdom has been that social democracy is in a terminal crisis.
But the fact is that the proverbial man (or woman) on the street will be able to indicate roughly what it is about.
The same has not been true of center-right forces: Christian Democrats, in particular, no longer push for European integration or offer a distinctive model, in line with Catholic social doctrine, for mediating conflicts between capital and labor.
Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they relied on a Cold War strategy of being the moderate center that served as a bulwark against communism.
As Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) discovered a few weeks ago, because warnings about a red menace are so implausible, reliance on them is widely perceived as a sign of desperation and intellectual bankruptcy.
Kurz did not solve the problem of a conservatism without qualities.
But he was a master of public relations: rebranding the staid Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) as a “movement” suggested youthful dynamism.
A “movement” connotes grassroots enthusiasm and participation.
But the reality was the opposite: what Kurz sold as a “new style” consisted of the ÖVP having to accept his total dominance.
Party elders agreed that Kurz alone would decide on candidates and set the programmatic direction of what was rebranded as the “Sebastian Kurz List.”
The latter was not a people’s party reinvented for a new age; it was and is a single person’s party.
Plenty of people both inside and outside the ÖVP probably liked Kurz’s post-2017 leadership. After all, it contrasted with the squabbling in the grand coalitions between Social and Christian Democrats that had dominated postwar Austrian politics.
And, whereas the ÖVP had long been divided by rivalries between old male barons in control of individual federal states, Kurz’s team was disciplined, remained on message, and was excellent at dominating coalition partners, be it on the far right or the left.
If the anti-corruption authorities’ accusations are true, they were also good at manipulating the press and fanning the flames of political conflict, as long as it served the ambitions of their man.
Legal and democratic theorists are right to say that an internally autocratic party is likely to exhibit autocratic tendencies in government.
Kurz in effect took a page from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s playbook, with frequent attacks on independent news organizations and the judiciary (and, like Silvio Berlusconi, portraying himself as the innocent victim of a vast conspiracy by a nefarious left-wing establishment).
Kurz has not succeeded the way Orbán has, but it would be premature to conclude that, west of the former Iron Curtain, the center will always hold.
Kurz himself, promising to step aside (but not down), has just been elected as leader of his party’s parliamentary group, receiving 98.7% support in a secret vote – just what one would expect when anything resembling intra-party democracy has been killed (even former US President Donald Trump, who has reshaped the Republican Party into a personality cult, has not managed such a feat).
In Germany, Markus Söder, the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, is likely to dominate the center-right in the coming years; he is at least as ruthless as Kurz and just as opportunistic.
The venerable Christian Democrat Wolfgang Schäuble did his utmost to prevent Söder from becoming the party’s candidate for German Chancellor this past spring, fearing that Söder, following Kurz’s template, would hollow out and in effect destroy his party.
Christian Democrats and center-right forces more broadly need to rethink what they stand for, beyond a claim to technocratic competence.
They also must decide where to draw the line vis-à-vis the far right.
The alternative, as Kurz’s example demonstrates all too clearly, is a quasi-authoritarian politics that regards democratic institutions like the judiciary and the free press as pesky obstacles for a charismatic and popular leader.

Ukraine’s Tale of Two Colonizations
LJUBLJANA – As everyone knows, Volodymyr Zelensky played a Ukrainian president in the television series Servant of the People before becoming Ukraine’s president in real life, and that irony led many not to take him seriously (as if a president who previously served in the KGB is better).
But less well known is the basic plot of the series.
Zelensky played Vasily Petrovich Goloborodko, a schoolteacher whose students record him ranting about corruption, share the video online (where it goes viral), and then sign him up as a candidate in the country’s next presidential election.
Having unwittingly tapped into Ukrainians’ widespread frustration over corruption, Goloborodko wins, faces a steep learning curve in office, and eventually starts to confront the country’s oligarchy from his new position of power.
The show’s depiction of Ukraine is apt.
Of all the post-communist countries in Eastern Europe, it was the hardest hit by economic “shock therapy” (sweeping market reforms and privatization) in the 1990s.
For three decades since independence, Ukrainian incomes have remained below where they were in 1990.
Corruption has been rampant, and the courts have proven a farce.
As Luca Celada of il manifesto writes, “the ‘conversion’ to capitalism has followed the usual pattern: a class of oligarchs and a narrow elite have enriched themselves disproportionately by despoiling the public sector with the complicity of the political class.”
Moreover, financial assistance from the West has always been “strongly tied to reforms that Ukraine was required to implement, all under the banner of fiscal restraint and austerity,” further immiserating much of the population.
Such is the legacy of the capitalist West’s engagement with post-independence Ukraine.
Meanwhile, my sources in Russia tell me that President Vladimir Putin has assembled a group of Marxists to counsel him on how to present Russia’s position in the developing world.
One can find traces of this influence in the speech he gave on August 16:
“The situation in the world is changing dynamically and the outlines of a multipolar world order are taking shape.
An increasing number of countries and peoples are choosing a path of free and sovereign development based on their own distinct identity, traditions, and values.
These objective processes are being opposed by the Western globalist elites, who provoke chaos, fanning long-standing and new conflicts and pursuing the so-called containment policy, which in fact amounts to the subversion of any alternative, sovereign development options.”
But, of course, two details spoil this “Marxist” critique.
First, sovereignty “based on their own distinct identity, traditions, and values” implies that one should tolerate what the state is doing in places like North Korea or Afghanistan.
Yet that is completely out of step with true leftist solidarity, which focuses squarely on antagonisms within each “distinct identity” in order to build bridges between struggling and oppressed groups across countries.
Second, Putin objects to “the subversion of any alternative, sovereign development options,” even though that is exactly what he is doing in Ukraine by seeking to deprive its people of self-determination.
Putin is not alone in pushing this pseudo-Marxist line.
In France, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen now presents herself as the protector of ordinary working people against multinational corporations, which are said to be undermining national identities through the promotion of multiculturalism and sexual depravity. In the United States, the alt-right succeeds the old radical left with its calls to overthrow the “deep state.”
Donald Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon is a self-proclaimed “Leninist” who sees a coalition of the alt-right and the radical left as the only way to end the reign of financial and digital elites.
(And, lest we forget the progenitor of this model, Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers’ Party.)
More is at stake in Ukraine than many commentators seem to appreciate.
In a world beset by the effects of climate change, fertile land will be an increasingly valuable asset.
And if there is one thing Ukraine has in abundance, it is chernozem (“black earth”), an extraordinarily fertile soil with high concentrations of humus, phosphoric acids, phosphorus, and ammonia.
That is why US and Western European agrobusiness firms have already bought up millions of hectares of Ukraine’s farmland – with just ten private companies reportedly controlling most of it.
Well aware of the threat of dispossession, the Ukrainian government imposed a moratorium on land sales to foreigners 20 years ago.
For years thereafter, the US Department of State, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank repeatedly called for this restriction to be removed.
It was only in 2021 that the Zelensky government, under immense pressure, finally started allowing farmers to sell their land.
The moratorium on sales to foreigners remains in place, however, and Zelensky has said that lifting it must be put to a national referendum, which would almost certainly fail.
Nonetheless, the cruel irony is that, before Putin launched a war to colonize Ukraine by force, there was some truth to the Russian argument that Ukraine was becoming a Western economic colony.
If the conflict has any silver lining, it is that the neoliberal project has been put on hold.
Since war demands social mobilization and a coordination of production, it offers Ukraine a unique chance both to halt its expropriation by foreign corporate and financial entities and to rid itself of oligarchic corruption.
In pursuing this opportunity, Ukrainians must bear in mind that it is not enough simply to join the European Union and catch up to Western living standards.
Western democracy itself is now in deep crisis, with the US veering toward ideological civil war, and Europe being challenged by authoritarian spoilers from within its own ranks.
More immediately, if Ukraine can achieve a decisive military victory (as we should all hope), it will find itself deeply indebted to the US and the EU.
Will it be able to resist even greater pressure to open itself up to economic colonization by Western multinationals?
This struggle is already playing out beneath the surface of Ukraine’s heroic resistance.
It would be tragic if Ukraine defeated Russian neo-imperialism only to yoke itself to Western neoliberalism.
To secure genuine freedom and independence, Ukraine must reinvent itself.
While being a Western economic colony is certainly better than being absorbed into a new Russian empire, neither outcome is worthy of the suffering Ukrainians are now enduring.

Three Threats to China’s Economy
SHANGHAI – After a decades-long “growth miracle,” China’s economy has lately become a source of mounting concern.
Some factors – from high corporate debt to overcapacity in the state sector – have received a lot of attention.
But three less-discussed trends point to still other threats to the country’s economic growth.
First, despite the decline in GDP growth, total social financing – and especially bank credit – has increased.
This relates directly to China’s debt problem: the continual rolling over of large liabilities creates a constant demand for liquidity, even if actual investment does not increase.
Such “credit expansion” – which is really just rolled-over debt – is not sustainable.
Clearly, the debt issue must be addressed.
And the Chinese government has been working to do so, implementing policies aimed at supporting debt restructuring.
For example, the central government has helped local authorities to replace CN¥3.2 trillion ($471.9 billion) of risky debt in 2015, and an expected ¥5 trillion this year.
Its corporate debt-for-equity swap plan could augment the impact of these efforts.
But these strategies cannot fully address China’s debt problem, not least because the largest share of debt in China is held by state-owned enterprises. One important solution that has not yet been proposed would involve a far-reaching restructuring of large SOEs.
The sale or transfer of state-owned assets would cover liabilities, breaking the state sector out of its debt-ridden status quo.
This approach would also create an opportunity to advance privatization, which could bolster innovation and competitiveness.
The second risky trend is the rapid decline in fixed-asset investment, from 20-25% to around 8% today.
The decline has been particularly marked in the private sector.
In 2002-2012, growth in private-sector investment averaged around 20%; by the end of last year, it amounted to just 10%, and from January to August of this year, it reached just 2.1%, including a stunning 1.2% contraction in July.
Investment in real estate has also slowed, having increased by just over 1% last year, owing to a number of policy constraints.
Given that private investment accounts for at least 60% of total investment in manufacturing, this will undoubtedly have macroeconomic consequences.
And, though double-digit growth in state-sector investment will temper the overall effect, this trend also reflects problems with state-sector dominance.
Private companies struggle to gain credit from state-owned commercial banks and are at a disadvantage in the direct financing market.
Moreover, private firms are blocked from entering SOE-dominated, capital-intensive, and high-end service industries. In most of the modern service sectors, the share of non-state actors remains small, limiting private investment.
The third trend that should be worrying China is that unemployment remains relatively steady.
Because the unemployment rate is not excessively high, this might seem like a good thing.
But it reflects some negative trends – starting with long-term weakness in productivity growth.
China’s productivity growth rate, which averaged 8% over the last 20 years, may have dropped now to less than 6%.
And the country is not exactly positioned for a surge in productivity.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the services sector has far outpaced manufacturing in employment growth since 2010, a reversal of the earlier trend.
Given the need for China to move away from manufacturing, this is not altogether bad news.
But most of the service-sector jobs being created are in low-end, low-productivity activities.
Worse, these are often informal jobs characterized by high turnover, which impedes long-run human-capital accumulation.
Stable employment levels in China also reflect – yet again – shortcomings in the state sector.
Few workers have been released from SOEs, despite the overall growth slowdown.
In other words, there is considerable hidden unemployment in China’s state sector, which is already plagued by other kinds of overcapacity.
China has no easy option for addressing this problem.
If the government continues to prop up SOEs, especially “zombie” firms, the concentration of a large number of workers in low-productivity, stagnant SOEs will continue to undermine productivity growth.
But if China pursues state-sector restructuring, unemployment will rise. And, once unemployed, state-sector workers tend to take much longer to find a new job than their private-sector counterparts do.
Yet state-sector restructuring seems unavoidable.
Indeed, it would help to address a number of the most fundamental challenges facing China, from debt and overcapacity to lack of competitiveness.
To be sure, some claim that SOEs should be allowed to continue their operations, citing their huge profits. But those profits are the result of their monopoly status and massive state investment, which brings lower returns than private-sector investment.
That is why progress on SOE reform is so urgent, regardless of the short- and even medium-term challenges that it might create.
Two decades ago, then-Premier Zhu Rongji began to pursue such reform, with the goal of bolstering the efficiency of SOEs and creating space for private-sector investment.
But the reforms were incomplete, and some have even been rolled back, with SOEs regaining market share in some cases.
In 2013, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China took up the mantle, with a plan to reform SOEs through mixed ownership.
But here, too, progress has been inadequate.
And, in fact, without a strategic reorganization of SOEs, mixed ownership will become a feature of only non-essential sectors.
If China is to succeed in its economic restructuring, industrial upgrading, and expansion of high-productivity services, the role of SOEs needs to be once again limited to a few relevant sectors.
Only then can China recapture its dynamism and keep its economic growth on track.

Cleaning Up Europe’s Vaccine Mess
BRUSSELS – COVID-19 has caused vast suffering across Europe, and the European Union’s slow vaccine rollout threatens to prolong the agony.
If the region’s leaders do not take decisive action soon, the pandemic could cause irreversible damage to the EU itself.
When the coronavirus hit the region in 2020, EU member states were unable to agree on vaccine deployment – their main line of defense against it.
National governments entrusted vaccine procurement to the European Commission, but then failed to harmonize their production and distribution strategies, or reach a consensus on which groups should be vaccinated first.
More recently, 13 European countries suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after a small number of people who had received it developed atypical vascular thrombosis.
The European Medicines Agency’s subsequent conclusion that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is “safe and effective” has not reassured everyone.
While several EU countries have continued or resumed their rollout of the vaccine, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden have maintained their suspensions, while France has limited its use to people over 55.
These continued differences are fueling increasing public mistrust, not only of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine but of the entire COVID-19 vaccination campaign.
The EU’s first priority for the coming weeks must be to address the vaccine shortage.
Here again, member states have failed to agree, and some are not hesitating to shop outside the EU for supplies.
Hungary is distributing the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, Slovakia has purchased it, and the Czech Republic is considering doing so, while Hungary has also bought hundreds of thousands of doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine.
Furthermore, Austria and Denmark recently announced a separate agreement with Israel for the production of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.
This pact notably foresees the establishment of a joint fund for research and development, and collaboration in clinical trials outside regular EU programs.
At the same time, Europe must protect people at risk who either are waiting to be vaccinated or will not respond to vaccines because they have a particular disease or are receiving certain treatments.
In the United States, monoclonal antibodies have been highly effective in meeting these important needs.
France, Germany, and Italy did not wait for EMA approval before offering these therapies once their national regulatory agencies had approved them, suggesting that antibody nationalism may be as prevalent as vaccine nationalism.
Faced with these challenges, the European Commission established a task force to manage vaccine supply in the coming months.
Led by Thierry Breton, EU Commissioner for the Internal Market, the task force aims to mobilize all available European production capacity, with the ambitious objective of immunizing 70% of European adults by the end of summer.
In parallel, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in February the establishment of the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) Incubator, an agency charged with tackling new coronavirus variants. HERA is intended to play a role similar to that of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which has been instrumental in the unprecedentedly rapid development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
And through BARDA, the US quickly secured a massive COVID-19 vaccine supply that has enabled the country to launch a much faster immunization drive than Europe.
The success of the US government’s Operation Warp Speed effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines is due not only to the scheme’s budget of more than $12 billion but also to its integration and coordination of steps throughout the vaccine value chain, from basic research to large-scale production and distribution.
This strategy entailed significant risk-taking, shared between the public and private sectors.
Operation Warp Speed’s governance, entrusted to a senior pharmaceutical executive experienced in vaccinology and a high-ranking US Army general responsible for the logistics, was another decisive factor in the plan’s success.
If the EU’s ambition is to reproduce an initiative like this in Europe, it is clear that mobilizing sufficient financial resources will be a significant obstacle – though perhaps not the biggest one.
Instead, the main challenge may be reaching an agreement between member states and the European Commission to grant HERA sufficient autonomy to ensure the agility the agency’s operations will need.
The European Innovation Council, recently inaugurated by von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron, could offer an interesting model in that regard. Together with the European Investment Bank, the EIC made it possible to maintain a European foothold on CureVac, the next COVID-19 vaccine to hit the market.
Whatever form the new agency takes, European leaders must urgently accelerate the region’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
In addition, they should define an ambitious new strategy to support pharmaceutical innovation in Europe for the benefit of people everywhere.

The Russian Coup Fantasy
WASHINGTON, DC – “For God’s sake,” US President Joe Biden declared last month, “this man cannot remain in power,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose war of aggression in Ukraine has rocked the global – especially European – economy.
While the White House immediately clarified that Biden was expressing moral outrage, not calling for regime change, the possibility of a Kremlin coup d’état has received much attention, especially as the country’s military has racked up huge losses of personnel and equipment.
Weeks before Biden’s declaration, US Senator Lindsey Graham called for a Russian Brutus to “take out” Putin’s Julius Caesar, and some observers believe that Russia’s military officers or security services might do just that.
Politicians and government officials, among whom discontent is reportedly growing, might support such a move, as might a broader defection of Putin-allied elites.
But this is probably wishful thinking.
Military coups depend largely on two factors: officers’ predisposition for overthrowing the government and the preventive measures taken by the regime.
In Putin’s meticulously constructed Fortress Russia, the former is in short supply, and the latter are abundant.
Outside Africa and Southeast Asia, successful military coups are increasingly rare.
Of the 55 coup attempts that took place in the Arab world between 1949 and 1980, for example, only half succeeded.
Since then, just eight attempts succeeded.
This reflects neither progress on democratization nor growing respect for civilian rule.
Rather, it is a result of measures by leaders to “coup-proof” their regimes by, say, obsessively monitoring troops and empowering rival security agencies.
In Egypt, any military unit with more than 30 troops has a security-services detail, and the phones of soldiers and their families may be tapped.
Moreover, to prevent the emergence of cliques, regimes routinely stoke tensions among senior officers and hinder cross-corps communication.
During the 2003 American invasion, Iraqi field units were prevented from sharing information with one another directly; instead, reports were transmitted to headquarters before being rerouted to the front.
Putin has long employed such tactics in Russia.
In some cases, this has meant simply upholding Soviet practices, such as embedding ideological cadres known as commissars within military units to scrutinize troops and identify potential “traitors.”
Today, it is Russia’s Federal Security Service – the successor to the KGB, of which Putin himself is a product – that fills this role. A praetorian guard loyal to Putin rather than to the state protects the Kremlin while elite divisions stationed outside Moscow are complemented by myriad security units.
Putin also gives intelligence organizations overlapping mandates, so that they can act as checks on one another. In 2016, he installed a loyalist in the newly created National Guard to quell internal dissent.
While the American president receives a morning intelligence assessment detailing world events, Putin receives a daily analysis of the elites’ machinations.
Such steps drastically limit officers’ ability to discuss the possibility of a coup, let alone stage one.
Despite these efforts, certain conditions – such as domestic strife, economic crisis, and foreign pressures – might increase military officers’ motivation to defy the regime.
But, even then, a coup attempt is far from guaranteed.
While sociopolitical turmoil has spurred military coups in Nigeria and Turkey, Colombia’s military refrained under comparable conditions.
Similarly, whereas a prolonged economic downturn pushed Ghana’s military to act, such circumstances induced forbearance by Ivory Coast’s military.
But it is foreign pressures, such as the suspension of aid or imposition of sanctions, that seem to be the least likely to induce a coup: they have failed in a broad range of countries, from Iraq to Peru.
Militaries might be more likely to react to decisions affecting their corporate interests.
For example, budget reductions or curbs on the military’s autonomy can inspire a response, though Russian officers remained in the barracks in the 1990s, when the Kremlin slashed the military’s budget and size.
Disastrous foreign escapades can also spur militaries to act.
Factionalism within the officer corps is another potential trigger.
In Turkey, tensions between generals and junior officers drove the former to seize power.
The same may occur in Russia, if younger field officers upset by the armed forces’ abysmal performance in Ukraine revolt against the top brass.
Even without such a revolt, sinking military morale can motivate officials to act.
NATO estimates that 7,000-15,000 Russian soldiers died in Ukraine in the first month of fighting.
According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, up to 20,000 Russian troops have been killed, including eight generals.
For comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over a decade in Afghanistan, and the United States lost fewer than a dozen generals during the eight years of its official military engagement in Vietnam.
Such high death tolls are likely to stoke fear and doubt among Russian troops in Ukraine, with reports of surrender, desertion, and sabotage suggesting exceptionally low morale.
The desire to end the carnage and restore esprit de corps might induce military officials to consider challenging Putin’s regime.
But these potential motives for a coup remain speculative.
Since 1905, Russia’s military has remained broadly apolitical.
When intelligence chief Lavrentiy Beria was removed in 1953 and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, the military merely implemented political leaders’ plans during intra-elite feuds.
Likewise, when Communist Party hardliners unsuccessfully tried to topple Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, virtually all senior military officers remained on the sidelines.
Russia’s military leaders seem committed to the idea of civilian supremacy, rather than believing that they must act as the state’s guardians, as their counterparts in countries like Egypt and Pakistan do.
This has rendered the Russian military a passive political player.
Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukraine will probably increase elite frustration and decrease civilian morale.
But a military coup in Russia remains as implausible as the idea, apparently pushed by the Putin propaganda machine, that Ukrainians would welcome Russian invaders as liberators.

The Ultimate Computer
The personal computer on my desktop is hundreds of times as fast, and has thousands of times as much memory, as the mainframe computer that served my entire university when I was a student. Such advances in the processing speed and storage capacity of computers are expected to continue until the laws of physics impose certain limits.
After all, we cannot shrink atoms or increase the speed of light.
Now, imagine a computer technology that eventually approaches these limits.
Imagine further that every star in every galaxy in the observable universe could somehow be fashioned into computers of this ``ultimate'' type.
That would be a lot of very fast computers.
Or if they were connected together we could think of them as a single, massively parallel computer: call it the ``Universe Computer.''
Admittedly, there are tasks - word processing, for example - at which this imaginary computer would be no more useful than any one of its constituent computers operating independently.
But for large, repetitive trial-and-error tasks, such as code breaking, the speed and power of this integrated ``Universe Computer'' would be vastly superior to anything we could ever hope to build, right?
Hold that thought.
Quantum theory - the branch of physics that deals with elementary particles and the microscopic properties of matter - has produced some of our deepest insights into nature, and describes some startlingly counter-intuitive phenomena.
For example, it implies that elementary particles, rather than being located at one position at a time, travel on several trajectories simultaneously.
No one disputes that quantum phenomena, if they could be harnessed, would revolutionize information processing, enabling ways of computing that no existing computer, even in principle, would be capable of duplicating. Among the tasks for which quantum computing would be ideally suited are ``algorithmic searches.''
Put simply, algorithmic searches are what computer programmers use as a last resort when looking for a mathematical needle in a haystack: they make the computer try every possible answer in turn until it finds the right one.
Obviously, the resources required for such searches are proportional to the number of possible answers: common sense tells us that trying a thousand possibilities requires a thousand times as many operations as trying one.
Trying a million possibilities requires a million times as many operations.
But our ordinary common sense does not apply in fundamental physics.
In 1996, the computer scientist Lov Grover discovered a quantum algorithm - a way to program a quantum computer - that could try out a million possibilities in only a thousand times the time needed to try one, and a trillion possibilities in only a million times the time of one, and so on, without limit.
What would happen inside a quantum computer when it performs an algorithmic search?
The unseemly truth is that most physicists are perplexed and embarrassed by this question.
Many explain away quantum phenomena with weasel words, or worse, they simply eschew explanation altogether. True, quantum phenomena cannot be observed directly.
But we can deduce their existence and attributes by measuring their effects on things that are directly observable.
We have never observed live dinosaurs, either, but we know they existed - and quite a lot about how they worked - from the fossil record.
A growing minority of physicists, myself included, accept the ``many universes'' interpretation of quantum mechanics. We concluded that what we observe as a single particle is really one of countless similar entities in different universes, subtly affecting each other through a process called ``quantum interference.''
To us, no mystery exists in quantum computation, only wonder.
Quantum computing, according to this view, is possible because a quantum computer performs vast numbers of separate computations in different universes and then shares the results through quantum interference.
The equations of quantum theory describe this phenomenon step by step.
But because such information sharing is achievable only through quantum interference, these same equations also drastically limit the types of task that quantum computation should be able to perform, or speed up.
Direct communication between universes is, for example, ruled out.
In fact, only a handful of potentially useful quantum algorithms are known at present.
Grover's algorithm is one.
Other known quantum algorithms will easily be able to crack the most widely used secure cryptographic systems of today.
Coincidentally, cryptographic systems which themselves use quantum computation are already commonplace in laboratories, heralding the development of communication that is both perfectly secure - even against quantum attack - and immune to future advances in mathematics or technology.
Quantum cryptography happens to be relatively easy to implement.
Unfortunately, we have no computers powerful enough to run any other useful quantum algorithm; building powerful quantum computers is a major scientific and technological challenge for the coming decades.
But theoretical physicists already know how many different types of components are required to make a quantum computer, and how complicated these components must be. The astonishing answer is that virtually any interaction between two information-carrying entities, including atoms or elementary particles, will do.
As the physicist Seth Lloyd commented, ``almost anything becomes a computer if you shine the right kind of light on it.''
It has long been assumed that a single type of machine, given time and memory, could simulate the behavior of any other state of matter.
It turns out that existing computers, or even the imaginary ``Universe Computer,'' are not the ones.
But a general-purpose quantum computer would be.
In quantum physics, this ``computational universality'' is part of the essence of all matter - and thus of the comprehensibility of nature.
No other branch of physics involves such wide-ranging interaction between theory, experiment, technology, and philosophy.
No other field of scientific research holds more promising implications for our understanding of the universe.

Bush's Four Years of Failure
Many around the world are surprised at how little attention the economy is receiving in President Bush's re-election campaign.
But I am not surprised: if I were President Bush, the last thing I would want to talk about is the economy.
Yet many people look at America's economy, even over these past three and half years, with some envy.
After all, annual economic growth - at an average rate of 2.5% - may have been markedly slower than during the Clinton years, but it still looks strong compared to Europe's anemic 1% growth.
But these statistics mask a glaring fact: the average American family is worse off than it was three and half years ago. Median real income has fallen by over $1,500 in real terms, with American families being squeezed as wages lag behind inflation and key household expenses soar.
In short, all that growth benefited only those at the top of the income distribution, the same group that had done so well over the previous thirty years and that benefited most from Bush's tax cut.
For example, some 45 million Americans today have no health insurance, up by 5.2 million from 2000.
Families lucky enough to have health insurance face annual premiums that have nearly doubled, to $7,500.
American families also face increasing job insecurity. This is the first time since the early 1930's that there has been a net loss of jobs over the span of an entire presidential administration.
Bush supporters rightly ask: is Bush really to blame for this?
Wasn't the recession already beginning when he took office?
The resounding answer is that Bush is to blame. Every president inherits a legacy.
The economy was entering a downturn when Bush took office, but Clinton also left a huge budget surplus - 2% of GDP ­­- a pot of money with which to finance a robust recovery.
But Bush squandered that surplus, converting it into a deficit of 5% of GDP through tax cuts for the rich.
The productivity growth that was sustained through the downturn presented both an opportunity and a challenge.
The opportunity: if the economy was well managed, the incomes of Americans could continue to rise as they had done in the 1990's. The challenge: to manage the economy so that growth would be robust enough to create the new jobs required by new entrants to the labor force.
Bush failed the challenge, and America lost the opportunity because of his wrong choices .
True, the economy was stimulated a little bit by Bush's tax cuts; it was probably stronger in the short run (though arguably not in the long run) than it would have been had there been no tax cuts.
But there were other policies that would have provided far more stimulus at far less cost.
Bush's objective, however, was not to maintain the strength of the economy; it was to push forward a tax agenda that shifted the burden away from those who could best afford to bear it.
Bush's failed policies have not only cost the economy dearly; they have left the economy in a far weaker position going forward.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office agrees that even without Bush's new expenditure initiatives and tax proposals, costing trillions of dollars, the deficit will not be eliminated in the foreseeable future - or even cut in half, as Bush has promised. Expenditures on which America's future economic health depends - on infrastructure, education, health, and technology - will be crowded out, jeopardizing long-term growth.
Because fiscal policy did not stimulate the economy, a greater burden was placed on monetary policy.
Lower interest rates worked (a little), but for the most part by encouraging households to refinance their mortgages, not by stimulating investment.
The increased indebtedness of households is already leading to higher bankruptcy rates, and will likely dampen the recovery.
National debt, too, has risen sharply.
The huge trade deficit provides the spectacle of the world's richest country borrowing almost two billion dollars a day from abroad, contributing to the weak dollar and representing a major source of global uncertainty.
There might be some hope for the future if Bush owned up to his mistakes and changed course.
But no: Bush refuses to take responsibility for the economy, just as his administration fails to take responsibility for its failures in Iraq.
In 2003, having seen that its tax cuts for the rich had failed to stimulate the economy as promised, the administration refused to revise its strategies, but instead just prescribed more of the same medicine.
It now promises to make those tax cuts permanent.
The real risk is that this is one promise that Bush, if re-elected, will try to keep.
At the end of August, I joined nine other American Nobel Prize winners in economics in signing an open letter to the American public.
It is hard to get any two economists - let alone two Nobel Prize winners - to agree on anything.
But in this case our concerns were so grave as to overcome any disagreements.
We wrote: "President Bush and his administration have embarked on a reckless and extreme course that endangers the long-term economic health of our nation….
The differences between President Bush and John Kerry with respect to leadership on the economy are wider than in any other Presidential election in our experience. President Bush believes that tax cuts benefiting the most wealthy Americans are the answer to almost every economic problem."
Here, as elsewhere, Bush is dead wrong, and too dogmatic to admit it.

The Burma Road Goes Through Beijing
NEW YORK amp#45;amp#45; Three hard facts are setting the boundaries for the talks United Nations negotiator Ibrahim Gambari is undertaking as he shuttles between Burma’s ruling generals and the detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
First, despite the heroic leadership of the Buddhist clergy and the pro-democracy community, almost 50 years of military misrule and terror tactics have worn down Burma’s people, who will likely find it hard to maintain their defiance without obvious splits among the ruling generals or widespread desertions among ordinary soldiers.
Second, Burma’s generals know that they face a stark choice: either maintain power or risk imprisonment, exile, and possible death.
In their eyes, this leaves them with virtually no choice but to hold on to power at all costs.
Finally, as long as China provides political, financial, and military support for Burma’s rulers, it will be all but impossible for any meaningful change to occur.
Until China decides that it has more to gain from a more legitimate government in Burma than it does from the current incompetent military regime, little can happen.
China’s decision to block the UN Security Council from condemning the Burmese regime’s assault on the Buddhist monks and other peaceful protestors underscores its long-standing political support for the junta.
This past January, China, alongside Russia, vetoed a Security Council resolution that condemned Burma’s human rights record and called on the government to stop attacks on ethnic minorities, release political prisoners, and begin a transition towards national reconciliation and democracy.
For years, China has also blocked meaningful sanctions against Burma.
China’s economic ties to Burma’s rulers are strategically important for both sides.
Annual bilateral trade, estimated at $1.1 billion – a huge figure, given Burma’s total GDP of $9.6 billion – provides an economic lifeline for the Burmese government.
China is also Burma’s largest military supplier.
At the same time, the $2 billion oil pipeline that China is seeking to build from Burma’s southern coast to China’s Yunnan province will allow China to get Middle East oil to its southern provinces more easily and securely.
When completed, the pipeline will make China much less susceptible to foreign military pressure in the event of international conflict.
So the stakes in Burma are high for China, as are Chinese fears of about how any future “national reconciliation” government might react to China’s record of complicity with the corrupt military rulers.
It should be remembered that America and its allies, faced with strategic fears of a similar type during the Cold War, also supported repugnant and oppressive regimes in places like Zaire, Chile, and Indonesia.
But America and the West did, at key turning points, realize that times had changed so much that these dictators had outlived their usefulness.
Thus, despots like Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and Chun Doo-hwan in Korea were jettisoned, because the price of supporting their despicable regimes became greater than the benefits.
In today’s Internet age, the costs of China’s support for Burma’s generals are rising fast.
Just as in Darfur, where China’s perceived support for the Sudanese government translated into harsh criticism and threats to brand the 2008 Olympics the “Genocide Games,” China’s backing of the Burmese generals, particularly if the death toll rises, could cause similar problems.
Indeed, an Olympic boycott will become more likely if scenes of murdered or brutalized Buddhist monks are flashed around the world. Moreover, Burma’s public health woes and drug and human trafficking are increasingly being exported to southern China.
Although China has expressed some vague concerns over the crisis to the Burmese government, it has not taken any action that could meaningfully affect the regime’s calculations, despite its singularly unique leverage.
To encourage China to take the lead in fostering national reconciliation in Burma, the international community must convince China that pushing for reform and change can be a win-win proposition.
The international community must make clear that China’s interests would be protected during a transition to a more open society in Burma, and that some version of the oil pipeline project will be supported by any new regime.
Because China has been competing with India for access to Burma’s natural resources, India also needs to be actively included in efforts to pressure the Burmese regime, a process that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) might effectively coordinate.
In a statement issued on September 27, ASEAN foreign ministers expressed a surprising degree of condemnation of the crackdown in Burma.
They could play an essential leading role in a process including the Burmese parties, China, India, the European Union, Russia, and the United States that could devise a roadmap for change in Burma.
Such an international process simply cannot happen without China.
The road to change in Burma runs through Beijing.

The Infrastructure Solution
TORONTO – “Infrastructure, by the nature of the word,” former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in February 2013, “is basic to the functioning of societies.”
And yet infrastructure has arguably been the forgotten economic issue of the twenty-first century.
Indeed, failure to make the right infrastructure investments has impaired many countries’ potential to boost economic growth and employment.
Though the debate about infrastructure tends to focus on the need for more money and more creative financing, the real problem is not insufficient investment.
Rather, the built environment is deteriorating as a result of a fragmented approach to infrastructure planning, finance, delivery, and operation, which emphasizes cost, asset class, and geographical location.
Developing a new approach – based on a broad, systemic perspective – should become a top priority of those with the capacity to deliver change, including CEOs and senior public officials.
That is precisely what McKinsey’s Global Infrastructure Initiative, which held its second meeting in Rio de Janeiro last month, aims to do, by promoting practical global solutions aimed at raising the productivity and efficiency of every aspect of infrastructure.
Without such solutions, an estimated $57 trillion of infrastructure investment would be needed in 2013-2030, just to keep pace with GDP growth.
That is more than the value of the entire existing stock of infrastructure.
More productive infrastructure could reduce the world’s infrastructure bill by 40%, or $1 trillion annually – savings that could boost economic growth by about 3%, or more than $3 trillion, by 2030.
This would facilitate higher infrastructure investment, with an increase equivalent to 1% of GDP translating into an additional 3.4 million jobs in India, 1.5 million in the United States, 1.3 million in Brazil, and 700,000 in Indonesia.
Increasing infrastructure’s productivity begins in the planning phase.
A more pragmatic approach to selecting infrastructure projects in which to invest – including a systematic evaluation of costs and benefits, based on precise criteria that account for broader economic and social objectives – could save the world $200 billion annually.
Some countries are already reaping the benefits of such an approach.
South Korea’s Public and Private Infrastructure Investment Management Center has reduced infrastructure spending by 35%; today, officials reject 46% of the proposed projects they review, compared to 3% previously.
Similarly, the United Kingdom established a cost-review program that identified 40 major projects for prioritization, reformed overall planning processes, and then created a cabinet sub-committee to ensure faster delivery of projects, thereby cutting infrastructure spending by 15%.
And Chile’s National Public Investment System evaluates all proposed public projects using standard forms, procedures, and metrics – and rejects as many as 35%.
Additional opportunities for savings – to the tune of $400 billion annually – lie in more streamlined delivery of infrastructure projects.
There is massive scope to accelerate approvals and land acquisition, structure contracts to encourage innovation and savings, and improve collaboration with contractors.
In Australia, the state of New South Wales cut approval times by 11% in just one year.
And one Scandinavian road authority reduced overall spending by 15% by updating design standards, adopting lean construction techniques, and taking advantage of bundled and international sourcing.
Opportunities to save are not limited to new capacity.
Governments could save $400 billion annually simply by increasing the efficiency and productivity of existing infrastructure.
For example, smart grids could cut power infrastructure costs by $2-6 billion annually in the US, while reducing costly outages.
Similarly, intelligent transportation systems for roads can double or triple the use of an asset – typically at a fraction of the cost of adding the equivalent in physical capacity.
The UK’s intelligent transport system on the M42 motorway has reduced journey times by 25%, accidents by 50%, pollution by 10%, and fuel consumption by 4%.
Congestion pricing can also reduce the need for new capacity, while providing significant savings in terms of fuel costs and time.
Such a charge has enabled the City of London to cut congestion by 30%.
None of these solutions is particularly earth-shattering.
They simply require a less fragmented approach within government, and more cooperation between the public and private sectors.
This goal is achievable in rich and poor countries alike.
Switzerland’s Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy, and Communications, for example, incorporates national goals, set by the Federal Council, into a unified infrastructure strategy that accounts for the needs of specific sectors. Likewise, Rwanda’s Ministry of Infrastructure coordinates the activities of other ministries and public agencies – ensuring that infrastructure strategies align with the East African Community’s regional integration plans – and monitors downstream delivery and operations.
Governments must recognize that the private sector can provide more than infrastructure financing; it can also offer know-how in the planning, construction, and operation phases.
Chile, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan are all developing frameworks that expand the role of private players in planning projects.
Infrastructure increases economies’ competitiveness, while providing the physical framework for people’s lives.
Policymakers’ goal should be to ensure that infrastructure realizes its full potential, so that the people who depend on it can realize theirs.

Rushdie a la Russe
June will be a cruel month in Russia's courts.
On June 16th, the rebellious oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his comrade-in-arms Platon Lebedev finally began to face the judges of the Meshchansky district court.
No doubt, this case will attract the Russian and international press.
Hearings began just the day before Khodorkovsky's trial opened in another case that is no less significant.
But this case is not about oligarchs trying to interfere in politics; it is about a group of artists and curators whose professional activities have unexpectedly turned into a political hot potato.
In January 2003, a gang of Russian Orthodox activists destroyed an exhibition in the Sakharov Museum and Public Center called "Caution!
Religion."
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life.
But the Orthodox fundamentalists found the art blasphemous and offensive, and some trashed the exhibition.
Last December, prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition's organizers with inciting religious hatred.
They now face prison terms of up to five years.
The vandals, meanwhile, were hailed by church officials as heroes. All charges against them were dismissed.
The vandals had influential protectors.
All of them were members of the congregation of St. Nicholas in Pyzhi, whose archpriest, Alexander Shargunov, is a well-known radical fundamentalist.
In 1997, he established a movement called the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland.
In 2001, the committee's Web site carried instructions on how to vandalize "immoral" billboards by splashing paint on them.
Followers promptly destroyed 150 billboards in Moscow.
A group of well-known nationalist intellectuals, including film director Nikita Mikhalkov, artist Ilya Glazunov, and writers Valentin Rasputin and Vasily Belov, weighed in with a petition calling the exhibition a "new stage of conscious Satanism."
They wrote that Russia's enemies were bent on humiliating the powerless "Russian people, their objects of worship, and their historic values."
Who, precisely, were these powerful enemies?
The intellectuals didn't identify them, but the fascist political party Pamyat (Memory) did not hesitate. The appeal posted on its Web site called on Orthodox Christians to protect "our Lord Jesus Christ" from "Yid-degenerates," using the most derogatory Russian term for Jews.
These alarming events in the art world have taken place against a background of rising nationalism and Orthodox assertiveness in Russia.
The Orthodox Church has acquired enormous political clout in recent years, and few politicians risk offending it.
The Sakharov Museum exhibition was subjected to a vituperative media campaign, and the matter was almost immediately taken up in the Duma, where nationalist deputies vied with each other to denounce the artists and laud the vandals.
In February 2003, the Duma passed a decree stating that the Sakharov museum exhibition's purpose was to incite religious hatred and to insult believers and the Orthodox Church.
The state prosecutor was ordered to take action against the organizers, with 265 of 267 deputies approving the measure.
In April 2003, the Duma voted to toughen the law against inciting religious hatred by adding prison terms of up to five years for offenders.
In December 2003, Sakharov Museum director Yuri Samodurov was charged with actions "leading to the provocation of hatred and enmity."
If found guilty, he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Church officials are not calling for that harsh a penalty.
In March 2004, the Moscow Patriarchy's External Relations Department issued a statement that surprised everyone.
It asserted, in effect, that the Sakharov Museum exhibition organizers had committed an administrative rather than a criminal offense.
The difference is that administrative offenses are punished with fines, at most, not prison terms.
Such a softening of the church's position was probably the result of the public outcry in Russia's liberal press.
Yet the pogrom at the Sakharov museum provoked a chain reaction of similar attacks on contemporary art by Orthodox fundamentalists whom the church has been unable to control.
Anna Alchuk, an artist who participated in the exhibition in the Sakaharov Center and was later charged, said she had read all 14 volumes of evidence collected by the prosecutor, and that 11 volumes consisted entirely of letters from "working people" expressing outrage at the show and demanding that the artists be punished.
Almost none of the writers had seen the exhibition - most had signed form letters.
"The events around the exhibition discredit the Russian Orthodox Church, just as the fatwah condemning Salman Rushdie to death discredited Islam," said Elena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov's widow.
The outcome of the court hearings is difficult to predict, but it will answer the question of whether Russians have lost the freedom artistic self-expression that they gained after communism's fall.
Disillusion with "democracy Boris Yeltsin-style" has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state.
Putin calls it "managed pluralism."
As we can now see, the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland wants to be among the managers.

The Planet After the Pandemic
BASEL – Scientists have little doubt: the destruction of nature makes humanity increasingly vulnerable to disease outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic, which has sickened millions, killed hundreds of thousands, and devastated countless livelihoods worldwide.
It also will impede long-term economic recovery, because more than half of the world’s GDP depends on nature in some way.
Could the COVID-19 crisis be the wake-up call – and, indeed, the opportunity – we need to change course?
While some politicians have claimed that a pandemic of this scale was unforeseen, many experts believed that it was all but inevitable, given the proliferation of zoonotic diseases (caused by pathogens that jump to humans from other animals).
More than 60% of new infectious diseases now originate in animals.
This trend is linked directly to human activities.
From intensive farming and deforestation to mining and the exploitation of wild animals, destructive practices that we dismiss as “business as usual” place us in ever-closer contact with animals, creating the ideal conditions for disease spillovers. In this sense, Ebola, HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) – all of zoonotic origin – were warnings the world failed to heed.
But COVID-19 could be different.
After all, it has demonstrated more starkly than any of its predecessors just how fundamentally linked human health and prosperity are with the wellbeing of our planet – and how vulnerable that leaves us.
Claims that protecting the environment would crash economies were not only shortsighted, but also counterproductive.
It is environmental destruction that has ground the world economy to a halt.
Moreover, unlike previous recent disease outbreaks, COVID-19 has spurred unprecedented state intervention, with governments worldwide developing and implementing comprehensive recovery strategies.
This provides a golden opportunity to entrench environmental protection and restoration in our economic systems.
Two principles should shape recovery strategies.
First, stimulus alone is not enough; better environmental regulations, conceived with the active participation of business and investors, are also crucial.
Second, public spending should be allocated in ways that support a better balance between the health of societies, economies, and the environment.
This means investing in green industries, especially those that move us closer to a circular economy.
Leading economists such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern have found that green recovery packages would offer much higher rates of return, more short-term jobs, and superior long-term cost savings than traditional fiscal stimulus. For example, building clean-energy infrastructure – a particularly labor-intensive activity – would create twice as many jobs per dollar as fossil-fuel investments.
Other priorities include investment in natural capital, such as large-scale restoration of forest ecosystems.
This would yield many valuable benefits, ranging from bolstering biodiversity and mitigating floods to absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
To complement such efforts, banks and other financial entities should be held responsible for lending practices that fuel the nature and climate crises.
Some decision-makers recognize this imperative.
The International Monetary Fund has published broad guidance for a green recovery, and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has called for environmental conditions to be attached to corporate bailouts.
The French government is already pursuing such an approach.
Furthermore, the European Union is drawing up a green COVID-19 recovery plan that would complement its European Green Deal, which aims to restore biodiversity and accelerate the shift to a zero-carbon economy.
A group of 180 European politicians, companies, trade unions, campaign groups, and think tanks recently released a letter urging EU leaders to adopt green stimulus measures.
But, to achieve a sustainable global recovery, many more governments will have to embrace green-recovery policies.
And, so far, many are doing the opposite, directing resources toward environmentally destructive industries and activities.
For example, according to the research involving Stiglitz and Stern, unconditional airline bailouts perform the worst in terms of economic impact, speed, and climate metrics. And yet billions are being channeled toward airlines, often with few strings attached.
In fact, according to a recent Green Stimulus Index report, more than a quarter of the stimulus spending implemented so far in 16 major economies is likely to cause substantial and lasting environmental damage. Some, such as US President Donald Trump’s administration, have also relaxed existing environmental rules, in order to help major polluters recover.
It is increasingly difficult to justify this approach.
Lest we forget, just before the pandemic, countries were experiencing unprecedented wildfires and devastating flooding.
As climate change advances, the extreme weather events that produce such disasters will become more frequent and severe.
Politicians and vested interests can try to divert attention from the challenges ahead.
But this will not prevent future crises; it certainly won’t make them wait until the COVID-19 recovery is complete.
On the contrary, a return to business as usual could hasten their arrival.
Rather than continue to stumble from one crisis to the next, we must build more resilient systems today.
Putting environmental preservation and restoration at the center of the COVID-19 recovery is the perfect place to start.

The SolarWinds Wake-Up Call
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent discovery of the devastating Sunburst hacking campaign against US and global targets is once again challenging the international community to respond to an increase in cyber attacks.
Over the past year, cybersecurity personnel worldwide have faced a surge of hacks against critical infrastructure, including institutions fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
While governments have openly condemned some of this behavior, more collective action is clearly needed.
There is no international treaty for cyber matters, and the 11 non-binding norms of responsible state cyber behavior endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly are somewhat ambiguous.
Additional norms are being put forward all the time, which is a good thing.
But norms are not treaties and should not be treated that way.
The better option is to concentrate on the spirit – not just the letter – of what the norms convey.
Indeed, the latest hacking revelation shows precisely why an international cybersecurity treaty would likely fail.
SolarWinds, a leading US network-management company, produces a monitoring platform that grants IT support staff remote access to devices that have it installed. The recent supply-chain attack hijacked the software’s update function to install the so-called Sunburst malware.
As the tech publication The Register reports, SolarWinds is deployed in more than 425 US Fortune 500 corporations, all major US telecoms companies, and most branches of the US government (with a similar presence in many other developed economies).
And the cybersecurity company FireEye, whose reported breach early last week was instrumental in uncovering the campaign, said that institutions worldwide may have been compromised, even if the US government was the likely focus.
The US government itself suspects Russian intelligence actors of perpetrating the attack, and the cybersecurity expert Jeff Moss has argued that unmasking the campaign could even prompt the attackers to take further action.
What we know for sure is that the SolarWinds attack unfolded over many months, and coincided with governments’ latest negotiations to strengthen and clarify cyber norms.
Of the eight norms that have been proposed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, at least one was clearly violated: the injunction that “state and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production.”
The attack may also have violated a number of other norms, such as protecting the “public core” (or backbone infrastructure) of the global Internet. (This is also a principle of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, signed by over 1,000 government, industry, and civil-society organizations.)
More important, at least three of the 11 norms already endorsed by the UN General Assembly may come into play in the SolarWinds case, including those meant to protect the information and communications technology supply chain, critical infrastructure, and the cyber defenders themselves.
Some detractors might argue that the wording of these norms is so vague as to allow for this kind of activity.
We disagree.
Cyberattacks often seem designed to fall into a grey area between agreed norms; that is no reason to excuse them.
In 2015, within months of the UN-mediated agreement on the norm to protect critical infrastructure, there were at least three attacks that looked like attempts to test the boundaries of the agreement.
For example, hackers almost destroyed a German steel mill, but arguably left undamaged the registered critical infrastructure of which it was a part.
Then, a power grid went down in Ukraine, but only temporarily, and (arguably) during a state of war, for which different rules apply. Finally, one of France’s largest private TV stations was attacked and forced off the air, but the network had not been officially designated as critical national infrastructure.
The lackluster international response to these breaches may have played a role in encouraging a much more controversial and widely noticed hack: the one directed against the 2016 US presidential election.
That effort fell into a grey area as well, because elections and election processes were not officially designated as “critical infrastructure” at the time.
No one can seriously claim that there was no foul in these cases because there was no clear norm violation. Norms are not legally binding rules, where the exact wording is determinative.
Rather, they are flexible instruments whose range of possible interpretations can be a strength, not a weakness.
They exist precisely because it is often difficult to interpret how existing international law applies in cyberspace, and because most democracies want to avoid being bound by an international treaty that is certain to be inadequately worded and poorly monitored.
The SolarWinds case shows why: In cyberspace, there will always be new techniques devised to fall outside the scope of any specific text.
But the attack also shows that considering more norms, even if only as subsidiaries to existing norms, could help clarify precisely which values the international community is trying to reinforce.
A norms-based approach not hamstrung by incomplete definitions can facilitate a stronger response to counter and discourage malicious cyber activities. But political will is still needed to follow through and punish these apparent transgressions.
The best way to dissuade bad state actors is through collective action that can impose consequences and thus establish customary international law.
Ultimately, norms exist to foster and support this type of response where appropriate, not to inhibit it. If we are going to prevent the recent surge in cyberconflict from spiraling out of control, such international action is urgently needed.

A New Fiscal Strategy for Germany
BERLIN – The extraordinary shock of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine are reverberating throughout the German economy.
Sharp increases in the prices of energy and raw materials, as well as continued and new disruptions to global supply chains, are postponing economic recovery.
Consumer and producer prices are rising at their fastest rate in a half-century, while forecasts for GDP growth are being revised downward.
In addition to these shocks, Germany is facing major medium- and long-term challenges that could further dampen growth and contribute to higher inflation.
For starters, productivity growth has fallen sharply since reunification in 1990 and has remained low since the 2008 global financial crisis. Higher productivity is key to longer-term economic growth, competitiveness, and price stability.
Moreover, demographic change in Germany will accelerate sharply, with the ratio of retirees to the working-age population set to rise markedly in the second half of this decade.
This will put increasing pressures on social security systems and labor markets, where limited access to skilled workers, already a problem, will constrain the economy’s medium-term growth prospects.
Future economic growth could also be markedly weaker if the necessary investments in decarbonization fail to materialize or Germany’s transition toward climate neutrality turns out to be excessively disruptive.
Higher fossil-fuel costs due to carbon pricing are essential incentives for developing renewable energy sources, but these intentional relative price changes risk driving up the overall price level.
Finally, Germany’s export-oriented economy is particularly dependent on the functioning and resilience of international supply chains, which since 2020 have proven to be fragile and vulnerable to persistent disruptions.
Economic growth could be slower and inflation higher if a partial reversal or reorganization of global trade means that Germany cannot rely on the benefits of the international division of labor as it did in the past.
Against this backdrop, Germany requires an efficient, forward-looking, and proactive fiscal policy that boosts sustainable growth through supply-side measures without further stoking inflation, and thus counteracts current stagflation risks.
At the same time, fiscal policy must take account of today’s global geostrategic challenges and strengthen the private-sector forces required for economic modernization, digitization, and carbon-neutral transformation.
These principles are reflected in the new fiscal strategy we recently presented at the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The strategy rests on three pillars, and seeks to achieve a carefully calibrated balance between tackling the current crisis and preventing the build-up of further inflationary pressures.
The first pillar is a powerful and resolute response to exceptional events like the ongoing war in Ukraine.
To this end, the government has already implemented two relief packages for households and firms that are suffering from the sharp increase in energy prices, including swift one-off payments to vulnerable households.
It is also protecting hard-hit companies.
To avoid creating additional inflationary pressures, these shock-absorbing measures are designed to be limited, temporary, and targeted.
For example, the support for companies is front-loaded to ensure that hard-hit but otherwise profitable businesses will survive the crisis.
The government is able to respond in this way thanks to the fiscal buffers built up before the pandemic.
Prudence in good times meant that we had sufficient financial reserves to boost the economy’s resilience in response to COVID-19 and now the war in Ukraine.
The second pillar of our fiscal strategy aims to initiate self-sustaining economic growth by unleashing the allocative and productive forces of the market.
Supply-side policies are therefore an integral part of our efforts to mitigate stagflation risks.
The strategy envisages the fiscal mobilization of private-sector investment without squeezing the economy further into inflationary bottlenecks.
This entails providing attractive incentives for companies and high-skilled individuals as well as improving financing opportunities for promising risk-taking enterprises.
More generally, we must strengthen Germany’s position as a good place to do business.
That will require a more innovation-friendly environment, with a competitive tax system, modernized public administration, and fast-tracked procedures.
The speed with which Germany is now building liquefied natural gas terminals and accelerating the energy-sector transition shows what can be done.
We urgently need to undertake similar initiatives in other sectors.
The third pillar of our strategy emphasizes fiscal resilience and thus debt sustainability.
It is reflected in the government’s commitment to return as early as next year to Germany’s constitutional “debt brake” (a balanced-budget rule that limits the state’s ability to borrow).
Exiting fiscal expansion and returning to a neutral stance will also contribute to the fight against inflation.
Returning to structurally balanced budgets will safeguard the sustainability of public finances, preserve investor confidence, and maintain public trust in the government.
The coalition government will need all three to secure funding for its modernization projects.
At a time of heightened inflation expectations, fiscal resilience and higher productivity growth are complementary goals.
Both will help to moderate inflation and boost the German economy.

Good Riddance to 2018
MADRID – Sadly, 2018 will not be remembered as a year of political and diplomatic success.
Though the international order had already begun to erode in 2017, the global political environment became downright chaotic, combustible, and hostile this year.
That is no coincidence, as these are perhaps the three adjectives that best describe the United States under President Donald Trump.
Since January 2018, when the Trump administration announced tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines, the year has been marked by an escalating “trade war,” waged primarily – but not exclusively – by the US against China.
The ongoing tariff disputes have seriously undermined the World Trade Organization and deepened mutual distrust in Sino-American relations.
For its part, China this year eliminated presidential term limits, raising fears that President Xi Jinping’s so-called new era will end the period of collective leadership ushered in by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, which were themselves a corrective to Mao’s cult of personality.
This move could also herald a further deviation from Deng’s trademark foreign-policy restraint.
Similarly, Russian President Vladimir Putin was reelected in March, to no one’s surprise.
Under Putin, Russia has been re-emerging as a geopolitical force.
And yet, its economy is essentially stagnant, owing in part to its excessive dependence on hydrocarbons.
In the absence of growth, Putin has relied on foreign policy to shore up his domestic popularity.
For example, Putin’s campaign press secretary welcomed the British government’s response to the nerve-agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, because it may have mobilized Putin’s supporters in the run-up to the presidential election.
And the Kremlin’s recent decision to blockade Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov may also have been designed to boost Putin’s domestic approval rating, among other goals. The danger now is that both the US and Russia will cease to implement the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, posing a new and acute threat to Europe in particular.
Meanwhile, the Middle East has continued to serve as a battlefield for some of the world’s most violent conflicts.
Though the Islamic State (ISIS) has continued to lose ground, it is far from defeated – contrary to what Trump has claimed – and the death toll in Syria’s civil war continues to climb. Likewise, the humanitarian calamity in Yemen has deepened, though negotiations that ran aground in 2016 have at least resumed and made some progress.
In Afghanistan, what is widely regarded as the longest-running war in US history continues, and it is estimated that the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since their government was overthrown in 2001.
Despite some recent developments in the aforementioned conflicts, the underpinnings of the Trump administration’s general strategy in the Middle East remained intact in 2018.
The US has reaffirmed its support for the axis of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, which it regards as a bulwark against Iran.
In May, the Trump administration moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
That same month, it abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and announced an abusive re-imposition of extraterritorial sanctions, which reflects the increasing weaponization of the US dollar.
Moreover, by siding with the Saudi government over his own intelligence agencies in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October, Trump has made clear that opposing Iran and purchasing US arms is one of the quickest ways to his heart.
The result of his broad approach to the Middle East has been to empower military hardliners throughout the region. In fact, Israel and Iran this year engaged in their first-ever direct military encounter.
Trump has also contributed, in one way or another, to the advance of populism around the world in 2018.
In Latin America, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) and Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro have shown that “populism” can encompass diverse ideologies.
While both claim to speak for “the people” against “the elites,” the leftist AMLO was elected partly as a rebuke to Trump, whereas Bolsonaro embraces a Trump-like brand of right-wing nationalism, and enjoys the support of many Brazilian elites.
The Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, often regarded as one of the Kremlin’s main ideologues, argues that “populism should unite right-wing values with socialism, social justice, and anti-capitalism.”
This “integral populism,” he believes, is perfectly illustrated by Italy’s current governing coalition, which comprises the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the nationalist League party.
In October, Italy’s government instigated a conflict with the European Union (which has fortunately subsided) by proposing a budget that defied EU fiscal rules.
Italy’s leaders justified their policies in the name of an outdated interpretation of “sovereignty,” one similar to that of the United Kingdom’s Brexiteers, whose haphazardness has left the UK’s future shrouded in uncertainty.
There were a few positive developments in 2018.
Certainly, the easing of tensions between the US and North Korea, and the even deeper rapprochement between North and South Korea, should be welcomed. Much credit belongs to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who used the occasion of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang to reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Trump’s subsequent turn toward diplomacy – which led to his historic summit with Kim – should also be applauded, though his administration has yet to achieve anything more than symbolic progress toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
The result of the US midterm elections was also good news.
Democratic control of the House of Representatives means that, from January 2019, there will be more checks on Trump’s policies.
And there have been welcome developments in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a recent resolution condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of Khashoggi, and another to end US support for the Saudi campaign in Yemen, passed with bipartisan support.
In Europe, the prospects for 2019 will depend primarily on three factors: Brexit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron’s push for EU reform, and the European Parliament election in May.
In each case, one hopes that the supporters of democracy, the rule of law, European integration, and multilateralism will prevail.
Those who oppose these principles have had a rather good year.
But they would be mistaken to think that those who uphold them have lost the will – and the ability – to cultivate a spirit of cooperation and harmony.

Europe Must Answer the Climate Call
BRUSSELS – In early 2015, the European Union became the first major economy to set a post-2020 target for limiting greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions.
By committing to reducing emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, the EU initiated a global movement that culminated in the adoption of the Paris climate agreement later that year.
This week, the EU has an opportunity to take up the banner of climate leadership once again.
EU leaders are currently discussing the bloc’s approach to the United Nations Climate Action Summit this September, which UN Secretary-General António Guterres hopes will serve as a political launchpad for a new round of commitments to cut GHG emissions.
The European Council must get the ball rolling, by adopting the 55% reduction target that the European Parliament endorsed in March. This is a time for bold action, not incrementalism.
Recognizing that the initial targets fell well short of what was needed, the Paris agreement requires participating countries to revisit their earlier commitments every five years.
Governments have committed to strengthening their targets to reflect their “highest possible ambition,” and the first such revision is due by 2020.
According to the UN, around 80 countries have already indicated that they will ramp up their climate commitments at this year’s summit. Recent announcements by the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Chile, Finland, and Costa Rica show that these governments have heard the call.
And China and India, two of the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies, have confirmed that they are ahead of schedule in meeting their initial targets, which suggests they could deepen their commitments over the coming year.
The EU must seize the moment and take advantage of emerging opportunities to decarbonize the global economy even faster.
The scientific consensus on climate change underscores the danger of complacency.
Global average temperatures are already 1ºC higher than in the pre-industrial era, and are continuing to rise by 0.2ºC per decade.
A world that is 1.5ºC warmer is just around the corner; if we continue along an irresponsible path, warming of 2ºC or more is inevitable.
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made clear, economic growth in a world that is 2ºC warmer will be much slower than in one that is 1.5ºC warmer.
And it should go without saying that the impact of rising sea levels, raging forest fires, acidifying oceans, and extreme weather will be more severe, more regular, and far costlier.
The IPCC finds that, to avoid the worst, global GHG emissions must be cut by 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, and then to net zero by 2050.
Yet, despite repeated warnings from climate scientists, global emissions are still rising, including in Europe.
As the UK and Irish parliaments recently acknowledged, following protests by young people around the world, we are facing a climate emergency.
For its part, the EU is working on a plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
But while long-term decarbonization strategies are welcome, they are no substitute for short-term measures, and they should not be considered a panacea for global warming.
Timing is everything, and without a transformational effort to halve global emissions by 2030, we will not be able to count on a safe future.
Fortunately, the EU is well positioned to lead the way.
New renewable-energy and efficiency targets established last year have put the bloc on track to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030, compared to its 2015 target of 40%.
Better yet, there is strong evidence that the EU could go even further. A recent report by Climate Action Tracker finds that bigger cuts in GHG emissions from the EU’s electricity sector, residential buildings, and passenger road and rail transport systems would reduce total emissions by 52% by 2030.
It is important to remember that pursuing even more ambitious emissions cuts would not imply an additional burden.
On the contrary, it would provide a pathway for economic renewal, improved quality of life, and reduced energy poverty, which currently afflicts 50-125 million Europeans.
According to the Climate Action Tracker report, emissions reductions in line with a 1.5˚C warming target would create 350,000 more jobs by 2030, particularly in the wind- and solar-energy sectors.
We could not have secured the Paris climate agreement in 2015 without the EU’s leadership in setting early, ambitious targets and in helping to bridge diplomatic differences.
Now, it’s crunch time, which means that Europe must rise to the occasion once again.

SOS for China’s SOEs
BEIJING – China’s economic slowdown has been the subject of countless debates, discussions, articles, and analyses.
While the proposed remedies vary considerably, there seems to be a broad consensus that the illness is structural.
But while structural problems, from diminishing returns to capital to the rise in protectionism since the global economic crisis, are certainly acting as a drag on growth, another factor has gone largely unnoticed: the business cycle.
For decades, China’s economy sustained double-digit GDP growth, seemingly impervious to business cycles.
But it wasn’t immune: in fact, the six-year slowdown China experienced after the 1997 Asian financial crisis was a symptom of precisely such a cycle.
Today, China’s business cycle has led to the accumulation of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the corporate sector, just as it did at the turn of the century.
While the rate of NPLs is, according to official data, lower than 2%, many economists estimate that it is actually more like 3-5%.
If they are right, NPLs could amount to 6-7% of China’s GDP.
Most of this debt is held by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which account for just one-third of industrial output, yet receive more than half of the credit dispensed by China’s banks.
Though the debt-equity ratio of the industrial sector as a whole has declined over the past 15 years, the SOEs’ has increased since the global financial crisis, to an average of 66%, 15 percentage points higher than that of other kinds of firms.
A looming recession undoubtedly spurred this debt accumulation, possibly aided by former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s massive 2009 stimulus package. But it was lax financial discipline that enabled the debt buildup.
Banks feel safe lending to SOEs, no matter how indebted, because the government implicitly guarantees the debt.
As a result, the SOEs, not surprisingly, have developed a habit of debt-financed growth.
That may not have been a problem when China’s economy was growing, but it represents a serious economic risk today, which is why the government has set deleveraging as one of its major tasks for this year.
But execution has been slow, owing partly to China’s failure to enforce its bankruptcy law fully.
The fact that commercial banks are not allowed to hold shares in companies has also impeded deleveraging, as it prohibits the use of direct debt-equity swaps to reduce SOE debt.
This should change.
China has employed debt-equity swaps to reduce NPLs in the state-sector before. In 1999, it established four asset-management companies (AMCs) to take on the weakest loans of the four largest state-owned banks, thereby improving those banks’ financial stability.
Given China’s high growth rates in 2003-2012, the AMCs made handsome profits from those shares.
Today, too, debt-equity swaps may be the only viable solution to the NPL problem.
But the government does not need to rely on government-owned entities to assume the debt.
Instead, it should allow private equity funds, which have accumulated large amounts of savings as they await good investment opportunities, to act as AMCs, bidding for the NPLs at a discount.
Such an approach would not just address the NPL problem; by giving the private sector a stake in the SOEs, it would also help to spur performance-enhancing reforms.
After all, despite their grim financial performance, many of China’s SOEs have a lot going for them, including state-of-the-art equipment, first-rate technical staff, and competitive products. Their problem is bad governance and poor management – a problem that, as China’s top leaders recognized in 2013, private-sector involvement can help resolve.
Of course, there are some obstacles to introducing debt-equity swaps between the public and private sectors, beginning with concern about the loss of state assets. Given the severity of SOEs’ debt problem – the National Railway Company alone holds CN¥3 trillion (over $40 billion) in debt – discounts are inevitable when SOE debts are transferred to private AMCs.
This could cause some to assert that the private firms are realizing unjust gains.
In order to overcome this obstacle, China should engage in local experimentation – a tried-and-tested approach that has long guided the country’s reform efforts – beginning in the regions where the SOE debt problem is the most acute.
The resulting revitalization of SOEs would also help quell any doubts about debt-equity swaps with the private sector.
Another obstacle is the fear that, by allowing SOEs, yet again, to escape market discipline, debt-equity swaps would set a dangerous precedent. But the improvements to corporate governance that would follow from the introduction of private shareholders would reduce substantially the likelihood that SOEs would continue to abuse the financial system.
Moreover, their NPLs are essentially sunk costs; debt-equity swaps are pretty much the only way to claw back anything at all.
By allowing private-sector participation in debt-equity swaps, China could kill three birds with one stone: advance SOE deleveraging, strengthen corporate governance in the state sector, and enhance economic efficiency.
With local experimentation, Chinese authorities map out that stone’s most effective trajectory.

Head for the Bunkers?
RIYADH – In August 2015, I tweeted that if Donald Trump were to be elected President of the United States, we would have to “head for the bunkers.”
A Trump presidency was considered highly unlikely back then; but here we are.
And while heading for the bunkers might not be the most appropriate response (yet), where we are is undoubtedly a more dangerous world.
Nearly two years ago, former US National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that, “as we look around the world, we encounter upheaval and conflict.”
As Kissinger observed at the time, “the United States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end of the Second World War.”
And what seemed true from the perspective of Washington, DC, was doubly so from a European perspective.
To put it plainly, Europe feels as though it were surrounded by a ring of fire, from the revisionist and revanchist Russia in the east, to the multiple meltdowns in the Middle East and North Africa in the south.
Since the spring of 2014, when Russia started fueling the conflict in Donbas and other parts of Eastern Ukraine, ten thousand people have died there, and another two million have been displaced.
And, of course, these figures pale in comparison to the humanitarian disasters in Syria, Libya, and Yemen.
Now, NATO is planning to deploy troops to Northeast Poland and the three Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – while the European Union struggles to manage continuous refugee flows and exert control over its external borders.
Moreover, the security threat from Russia has prompted a gradual increase in European defense spending and security cooperation.
Whereas the EU has traditionally made peace and prosperity its primary objectives, it is now being forced to prioritize security above all else.
That is a significant change.
The “complex array of crises” has also not spared Saudi Arabia, from whence I am writing.
No one seems to have an answer to such fundamental questions as how to restore stability to Yemen and the Levant, but everyone knows that as the conflicts continue, it becomes more likely that the entire region will be destabilized.
This is a threat that no one can ignore.
Equally concerning are the voices in Washington calling for renewed confrontation with Iran, just after the nuclear deal between that country and the P5+1 – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the US, plus Germany – averted the danger of such a confrontation (if not outright war).
Against this volatile backdrop, the new Trump administration could very well embrace vastly different policies from what we have seen so far.
Judging by the last few weeks, it seems as though we are going to have to live with a routine spectacle of international destabilization via Twitter.
For example, by questioning America’s longstanding “One China” policy, Trump has indicated that he might subject even the most fundamental aspects of US foreign policy to renegotiation and new “deals.”
National capitals around the world are undoubtedly feeling uneasy about what the future holds.
To be sure, incoming US administrations always usher in a period of relative uncertainty; it takes time for a new team to get up to speed, and to formulate policies in accordance with information that may not have been previously available, such as intelligence briefings.
Crisis management is an art form that one can only learn through experience, and with some training.
Still, after years of rising turmoil and uncertainty, we have no choice but to assume that more “black swan” events are around the corner.
From Donbas to North Korea to the Gulf region, there is no shortage of places where developments could take a shocking turn.
In normal times, the web of international relations affords enough predictability, experience, and stability that even unexpected events are manageable, and do not precipitate major-power confrontations.
There have been close calls in recent decades, but there have not been any unmitigated disasters.
But those times may be over.
We are entering a period of geopolitical flux: less stable alliances and increasing uncertainty.
One should not exaggerate the risk of things spiraling out of control; but it is undeniable that the next crisis could be far larger than what we are used to, if only because it would be less manageable.
And that is unsettling in itself.
Eventually, the world will become accustomed to the Trump administration, and the Trump administration will get used to the world.
But now that unpredictability is the order of the day, and a collective “me first” outlook has taken hold, we should prepare for the possibility that turmoil could go global.
In other words, while it is not time to head for the bunkers, it certainly wouldn’t hurt to have one nearby.

The Hidden Danger of Big Data
CAMBRIDGE – In game theory, the “price of anarchy” describes how individuals acting in their own self-interest within a larger system tend to reduce that larger system’s efficiency.
It is a ubiquitous phenomenon, one that almost all of us confront, in some form, on a regular basis.
For example, if you are a city planner in charge of traffic management, there are two ways you can address traffic flows in your city.
Generally, a centralized, top-down approach – one that comprehends the entire system, identifies choke points, and makes changes to eliminate them – will be more efficient than simply letting individual drivers make their own choices on the road, with the assumption that these choices, in aggregate, will lead to an acceptable outcome.
The first approach reduces the cost of anarchy and makes better use of all available information.
The world today is awash in data.
In 2015, mankind produced as much information as was created in all previous years of human civilization.
Every time we send a message, make a call, or complete a transaction, we leave digital traces.
We are quickly approaching what Italian writer Italo Calvino presciently called the “memory of the world”: a full digital copy of our physical universe.
As the Internet expands into new realms of physical space through the Internet of Things, the price of anarchy will become a crucial metric in our society, and the temptation to eliminate it with the power of big data analytics will grow stronger.
Examples of this abound.
Consider the familiar act of buying a book online through Amazon.
Amazon has a mountain of information about all of its users – from their profiles to their search histories to the sentences they highlight in e-books – which it uses to predict what they might want to buy next.
As in all forms of centralized artificial intelligence, past patterns are used to forecast future ones.
Amazon can look at the last ten books you purchased and, with increasing accuracy, suggest what you might want to read next.
But here we should consider what is lost when we reduce the level of anarchy.
The most meaningful book you should read after those previous ten is not one that fits neatly into an established pattern, but rather one that surprises or challenges you to look at the world in a different way.
Contrary to the traffic-flow scenario described above, optimized suggestions – which often amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy of your next purchase – might not be the best paradigm for online book browsing.
Big data can multiply our options while filtering out things we don’t want to see, but there is something to be said for discovering that 11th book through pure serendipity.
What is true of book buying is also true for many other systems that are being digitized, such as our cities and societies. Centralized municipal systems now use algorithms to monitor urban infrastructure, from traffic lights and subway use, to waste disposal and energy delivery.
Many mayors worldwide are fascinated by the idea of a central control room, such as Rio de Janeiro’s IBM-designed operations center, where city managers can respond to new information in real time.
But with centralized algorithms coming to manage every facet of society, data-driven technocracy is threatening to overwhelm innovation and democracy.
This outcome should be avoided at all costs.
Decentralized decision-making is crucial for the enrichment of society.
Data-driven optimization, conversely, derives solutions from a predetermined paradigm, which, in its current form, often excludes the transformational or counterintuitive ideas that propel humanity forward.
A certain amount of randomness in our lives allows for new ideas or modes of thinking that would otherwise be missed.
And, on a macro scale, it is necessary for life itself.
If nature had used predictive algorithms that prevented random mutation in the replication of DNA, our planet would probably still be at the stage of a very optimized single-cell organism.
Decentralized decision-making can create synergies between human and machine intelligence through processes of natural and artificial co-evolution.
Distributed intelligence might sometimes reduce efficiency in the short term, but it will ultimately lead to a more creative, diverse, and resilient society.
The price of anarchy is a price well worth paying if we want to preserve innovation through serendipity.

Bush’s New Middle East
President George W. Bush’s declaration of “mission accomplished” in Iraq five years ago was as hubristic as his current assessment that the “surge” has “delivered a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror” is a fantasy.
The Iraq adventure is not only the longest and most expensive war in America’s history – the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has advanced a staggering estimate of $3 trillion – but is also the least conclusive.
The war has pulverized Iraqi society, dissolving it into an ethno-sectarian patchwork.
The “surge” will end sooner or later, and the Iraqis, crippled by violence and corruption, will still be incapable of uniting their polity, and, with their military still unable to take over from the Americans, jihadi and inter-ethnic violence is bound to erupt again.
As Iraqi Colonel Omar Ali, the Iraqi battalion commander in Mosul, the main focus of the insurgency today, recently put it, “Without the Americans, it would be impossible for us to control Iraq.”
Wars, as Winston Churchill defined them, are always “a catalogue of blunders.”
History’s judgment of the Iraq war will therefore certainly dwell more on whether it has accomplished its strategic objectives of “reconstructing” a highly dysfunctional Middle East in America’s democratic image and consolidating America’s hegemonic position in the region than on its price in blood and money.
Strategically, the war was an utter failure. A clear case of imperial overstretch, the war strained America’s military, undermined the America’s moral standing worldwide and its reputation in the Middle East, severely threatened its economy, and showed to both friends and foes the limits of American power.
The most serious unintended consequence of the war is the emergence of a powerful Shia challenge to the West’s Sunni allies in the Middle East.
America’s destruction of Iraq as a regional power handed hegemony in the Persian Gulf – whose centrality to Western interests cannot be overstated – to Iran’s Shia Islamist regime on a silver platter.
On the rubble of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, the Americans helped create in Iraq the first Shia-dominated Arab state, which may well become subservient to Iran’s regional ambitions – a calamity of historic dimensions for America’s Sunni allies.
President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad’s recent state visit to Iraq conveyed to the Americans an unequivocal message: the prospects of the United States ever reaching a modicum of stability in Iraq have become dependent on Iran-aligned forces.
America’s difficulties in Iraq and beyond contributed decisively to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
The Iranians now see themselves as immune from an American attack on their nuclear installations, for America’s troubles in Iraq and the growing opposition to the war in the US are a signal to them that America’s strategy of pre-emptive wars has failed.
But, however radical the Iranian regime might be, it is not suicidal.
Hence, the threat of a nuclear Iran might consist less in its propensity to start a nuclear war with Israel than in its capacity to project its regional power effectively.
A nuclear Iran might even threaten America’s capacity to project conventional military force in the Gulf in times of crisis.
Nor should the possibility be ruled out that Iran might be tempted to back its regional ambitions by supplying nuclear material to proxy terrorist groups.
If anything, America’s debacle in Iraq has only emboldened the challengers of the status quo in the region.
That has also been the result of Bush’s ill-conceived democracy crusade in the Arab world.
Bush discovered to his dismay that any exercise in Arab democracy is bound to usher in anti-Western Islamists, be it the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Shia parties in Iraq, or Hamas in Palestine.
The US eventually had to abandon its fantasies about Western-style Arab democracy, but it ironically left the Iranians carrying the torch of democracy in the region.
After all, Iran was quick to recognize that free elections are the safest way to undermine the Middle East’s pro-American regimes.
The Iraq war also meant that America ignored the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The chances that the Bush administration might be able to rally America’s Sunni “moderate” allies in the region to help salvage an Israeli-Palestinian peace are now hostage to an Iranian-led regional axis that includes Hamas, Hezbollah, and Syria.
All are united in their rejection of a Pax Americana in the Middle East, and all have so far shown remarkable resilience in ignoring America’s pre-conditions for a dialogue.
America’s inability to inspire the peoples of the Middle East, all ruled by US-backed autocracies, is not exactly stunning news.
What is news is that American power might also be losing its ability to intimidate them.

The Emerging “New Middle East”
President George W. Bush’s Middle East policy undeniably managed to achieve one thing: it has thoroughly destabilized the region.
Otherwise, the results are not at all what the United States had hoped to accomplish.
A democratic, pro-Western Middle East is not in the cards.
But, while things are not developing as American neo-conservatives had intended, they are nevertheless developing.
The historical failure named Iraq war, the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the soaring oil and gas prices have wrought profound changes in the region.
From Damascus to Dubai, from Tel Aviv to Teheran, a new Middle East is now emerging.
The old Middle East arose from the borders and political identities created by the European powers after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1918.
Its driving ideological force was a European-inspired secular nationalism, which strove for political and social modernization through top-down government action. This type of nationalism, or “Arab socialism,” reached its apex during the Cold War, when it could lean on Soviet military, political, and economic support.
Its end came with that of the Soviet Union, as it petrified into authoritarian, corrupt, and inefficient military regimes and dictatorships.
The end of the Soviet Union also triggered a profound military crisis in many Arab states: without Soviet support as an external guarantor of their military capabilities, the nationalist regimes were no longer able to keep pace with military modernization.
The nationalist regimes thus gradually lost domestic popular legitimacy, creating a vacuum that non-state actors have now largely filled.
The ideological forces and the currency of power have also changed, with political Islam replacing secularism while skillfully integrating social issues and revolutionary, anti-Western nationalism.
Today, the old Middle East can still be found in Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, and Fatah-controlled Palestine.
The new Middle East includes Dubai, the Gulf emirates, and Israel, as well as Hezbollah, Hamas, and jihadi terrorism – and, partly, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Jordan and Morocco are also trying to associate themselves with the new Middle East.
Obviously, as these examples suggest, “new” does not necessarily mean better, but simply different and more modern.
Indeed, modernization by no means implies a solution to the conflicts that continue to fester in the region.
Instead, these conflicts are themselves “modernized,” which could make them even more dangerous than in the past.
An aspect of such modernization could be seen in the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah, where tank warfare was rendered obsolete by missiles and Katyushas.
At the same time, non-state actors, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and al-Qaeda, have taken the place of traditional armies, and suicide bombers equipped with road-side and car bombs or explosive belts have replaced guerrilla fighters with their Kalashnikovs.
Perhaps the most important change is the shift in the region’s political and military center of gravity.
While Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon defined the most important hot spots in the old Middle East, regional power and politics in the wake of the Iraq war is now centered in the Persian Gulf.
The dominant conflict is no longer the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, but the threat of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia for sub-regional supremacy, and between Iran and the US for regional hegemony.
Indeed, it is by now virtually impossible to implement any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without Iran and its local allies – Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine.
In a way, then, the war in Iraq forms the strategic and military bridge between the old and the new Middle East.
The US intervention has brought about four far-reaching changes in the region:
· Iran’s hegemonic ambitions have been unleashed, and the country has been helped to a strategic position that it could never have reached on its own.
· The democratization of Iraq has empowered the Shi’a majority, which in turn greatly strengthened Iran’s influence.
Indeed, the war in Iraq has transformed the centuries-old Shi’a-Sunni conflict by infusing it with modern geopolitical significance and extending it to the entire region.
· The rise of Iran poses an existential threat to Saudi Arabia, because the country’s oil-rich northeast is populated by a Shi’a majority.
A Shi’a government in Baghdad, dominated by Iran, would, in the medium term, threaten Saudi Arabia’s territorial integrity – a scenario that the Saudis cannot, and will not, accept.
· Should Iran manage to become a nuclear power, the Saudis’ existential fears would dramatically escalate.
More generally, the currency of conventional military power in the Middle East would largely lose its value, inevitably resulting in a regional nuclear arms race.
Emanating from this new situation is the threat of disintegration of the whole Anglo-French system of states in the Middle East.
The first candidate is, of course, Iraq.
Whether Iraq can be held together despite the ethnic and religious confrontations that pit Kurds against Arabs and Sunnis against the Shi’a is one of the most pregnant questions for the new Middle East.
For Iraq’s disintegration would be hard to contain; indeed, it could bring about a thorough balkanization of the region.
Another important question is whether political Islam will move toward democracy and acceptance of modernity or remain trapped in radicalism and invocation of the past?
The forefront of this battle is, at the moment, not in the Middle East, but in Turkey; nevertheless, the result is bound to have more general significance.
The emergence of the new Middle East may present an opportunity to establish a regional order that reflects the legitimate interests of all the actors involved, provides secure borders, and replaces hegemonic aspirations with transparency and cooperation.
If not, or if such an opportunity is not seized, the new Middle East will be much more dangerous than the old one.

The Erosion of Europe
BERLIN – Just weeks ago, the worst of the financial crisis in Europe seemed to be over.
Stability seemed to be returning.
But appearances proved to be deceptive.
A minor problem (at least in scale) like Cyprus, when combined with an almost unbelievable degree of incompetence among the “troika” (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), was enough to turn a molehill into a mountainous crisis.
While markets remained calm, the Cyprus crisis revealed the full extent of the political disaster that the eurozone crisis has wrought: the European Union is disintegrating at its core.
Europeans’ current crisis of confidence concerning Europe is far more dangerous than renewed market anxiety, because it cannot be overcome with another liquidity injection by the ECB.
Europe’s old political order was based on competition, mistrust, power rivalries, and, ultimately, war among sovereign states.
It collapsed on May 8, 1945, and was replaced by a system based on mutual trust, solidarity, the rule of law, and compromise.
But, with the crisis eroding these foundations, trust is giving way to mistrust, solidarity is succumbing to ancient prejudices (and even new hatred between the poor south and the rich north), and compromise is being overwhelmed by diktat.
And Germany is once again at the center of the process of disintegration.
That is because Germany, by far the EU’s strongest economy, has enforced a strategy for overcoming the eurozone crisis that worked for Germany at the beginning of the millennium, but under completely different internal and external economic conditions.
For the distressed southern European states, the German-backed mixture of austerity and structural reforms is proving fatal, because the decisive third and fourth components – debt relief and growth – are missing.
It is only a matter of time before one of the large European crisis countries elects a political leadership that no longer accepts the austerity diktats.
Even now, come election time, national governments more or less openly promise to protect their citizens from Europe, because Germany has seen to it that austerity and structural reforms take pride of place in managing the crisis.
The argument that “tough love” was necessary in southern Europe, because nothing there would ever have changed otherwise, has been settled.
The love has been very tough indeed, generating rapid economic contraction, massive unemployment (upwards of 50% among young people), and continued fiscal deterioration, owing to rising debt-service costs. Indeed, all eurozone members are now experiencing weak economic growth, if not recession.
What does Germany want?
A German Europe would never work, and the country’s political class lacks both the courage and the determination to pursue a European Germany.
So, does Germany want to hold together the monetary union and thus preserve the EU, or will it allow dithering and a lack of vision to hasten the erosion of Europe’s foundations?
In this crisis, intention takes a back seat to action (or lack thereof).
The International Herald Tribunerecently quoted Winston Churchill: “It’s not enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what’s required.”
That is precisely the order of the day in Europe and the eurozone.
What needs to be done has long been clear.
The price of the monetary union’s survival, and thus that of the European project, is more community: a banking union, fiscal union, and political union.
Those who oppose this because they fear common accountability, transfers from rich to poor, and a loss of national sovereignty will have to accept Europe’s re-nationalization – and thus its exit from the world stage.
No alternative – and certainly not the statusquo – will work.
It has become common knowledge in Europe that the ongoing crisis will either destroy the EU or bring about a political union, and that, without a solidarity-based solution to existing debt and a partial mutualization of new debt, the euro cannot be saved.
Such steps will make far-reaching transfers of sovereignty unavoidable.
Is Germany – or France – willing to do that?
The real crisis of the EU and the monetary union is not financial but political – or, more precisely, it is a leadership crisis.
A lack of vision, courage, and strength of purpose is on display in all European capitals, but especially so in Berlin (and on the part of government and opposition alike).
Europe’s national politicians routinely criticize the EU for its lack of democratic legitimacy, yet they bear part of the responsibility for it.
Or have pro-Europeans become so faint-hearted and dejected that they prefer simply to hand over the reins to anti-European populists and nationalists?
That would be a disaster, because the crisis now runs too deep to be resolved by technocratic means.
Germany is preparing for a national election in which – much like in last year’s French presidential election – the European crisis is to play no part, or at least only a minor one.
Both government and opposition believe that it would be better to tell the people the truth concerning the most vital question of the day only after the election (and in measured doses).
Such an outcome would make a mockery of democracy.
But things may turn out very differently if the dynamics of Europe’s crisis throw German politicians’ plans into disarray.
An unpleasant surprise cannot be ruled out; at this point, it might be Europe’s greatest source of hope.

Why Iran Won’t Budge
TEL AVIV – No one really believed that the latest round of international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would produce a breakthrough.
So it was no surprise that itdid not, despite the concessions that were made at the meeting in Kazakhstan by the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany).
America’s belief that a harsh sanctions regime could coax Iran into a deal has proved – at least so far – to be unrealistic.
Despite being isolated and ostracized, Iran has managed to gain some strategic breathing room with the help of countries like China, Russia, India, Syria, and Venezuela, allowing it to resist Western pressure.
More important, even though the severe sanctions regime led by the United States is bound to be imperfect – it only hardens further Iran’s resistance to “America’s designs.”
To be sure, Iran’s alliances are vulnerable to erosion and, in the case of two staunch allies, Syria and Venezuela, to outright collapse.
The end of Chavismo would threaten Iran’s vast interests in Venezuela and its considerable presence in the Andes, while the fall of the Assad dynasty would be a devastating blow to Iran’s regional strategy.
Even so, Russia and China continue to take a much more lenient approach to Iran than Europe and the US have since the International Atomic Energy Agency’s report in November 2011 described in detail Iran’s activities in pursuing the capability to produce nuclear weapons.
While the Western powers have embraced ever-harsher sanctions, Russia and China view Iran as a tool in their global competition with the US.
China’s Iranian interests boil down to economics.
Bilateral trade stands at about $40 billion a year, and China is not only Iran’s largest customer for crude oil, but also a colossal investor – somewhere between $40 billion and $100 billion – in Iran’s energy and transport sectors.
True, China cannot entirely overlook US pressure and the staunch opposition of its top oil supplier, Saudi Arabia, to Iran’s nuclear program. But, while China has supported the mandatory sanctions set by the United Nations Security Council, it has rejected the West’s unilateral measures.
With bilateral trade worth only about $5 billion annually, Russia’s economic interests in Iran are fairly modest. But it fears Iran’s ability to cause trouble, particularly by stirring up unrest among Russia’s Muslim citizens.
Moreover, America has refused to pay the Kremlin’s high price – curtailment of congressional human-rights legislation, repeal of Cold-War-era restrictions on Russian-US trade, and abandonment of plans for ballistic missile defense in Europe – for Russian support on Iran (or, for that matter, on any other trouble spot, such as Syria).
The problem with the US drive to have key stakeholders join its anti-Iran crusade is that some of them live in neighborhoods where Iran is an important factor.
India is certainly alarmed at the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, not to mention its concern at the possible effects of Iran’s Islamist fundamentalism on Kashmiri Muslims. But its $14 billion in annual bilateral trade, and dependence on Iranian oil – many of India’s refineries have been built to run solely on Iranian crude – are key strategic considerations.
Moreover, India needs Iran as an alternative trade and energy conduit to Central Asia, bypassing rival Pakistan, and also as a hedge against an uncertain future in Afghanistan after America’s withdrawal in 2014.
As a result, India’s policy mirrors China’s: it has aligned itself with mandatory international sanctions, but has abjured voluntary Western financial restrictions. The best one can expect is that India continues to act at the margin – for example, by reducing dependence on Iranian oil while increasing imports from Saudi Arabia, already its largest supplier of crude.
The equivocal nature of Iran’s alliances, however, can be a mixed blessing.
Yes, a harsh sanctions regime might still gain additional supporters, but an Iran with its back against the wall would probably be even more obstinate in its nuclear drive.
After all, Iraq was an easy target in the first Gulf War precisely because it had abandoned its nuclear program, and possessed no weapons of mass destruction.
Similarly, Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi exposed himself to a NATO onslaught by relinquishing his WMDs.
By contrast, North Korea shows that defiance, rather than accommodation, is a strategy that works.
That is why Syria, with North Korean assistance, tried to develop a nuclear program (presumably destroyed by Israel’s officially unacknowledged “Operation Orchard” in 2007).Iran will not consider abandoning its nuclear insurance policy unless a broad agenda is agreed upon that addresses Iran’s concerns as a regional power and secures the immunity of its Islamist regime from American actions.
Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity as “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” could be applied to America’s Iran policy.
The diplomacy of sanctions, ostracism, and brinkmanship has failed resoundingly.
As Iran’s uranium-enrichment and other weapons-development activities continue unabated, the US needs to make a break with the old rules of engagement.

Preparing for the Trump Trade Wars
LONDON – Is US President Donald Trump what Maoists used to call a paper tiger, or should his noisy threats be taken seriously?
That question has loomed particularly large over the North Korean nuclear issue.
But after Trump’s fairly emollient 12-day tour of Asia, fears of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula have ebbed somewhat.
And yet that same tour raised another threat, which the world has every reason to take seriously.
In the second year of his presidency, Trump’s administration will likely set its sights on trade, suggesting that the prospect of more trade wars will increase substantially.
In his first year in office, Trump has often huffed and puffed about other countries’ unfair trade practices, just as he did during the 2016 election campaign; but he has done little to turn words into deeds.
This inaction is understandable.
Trump is relying on China – one of America’s largest trade partners – to apply pressure on the North Korean regime, while US businesses have lobbied vigorously against any measures that might inhibit trade.
Still, Trump’s apparent restraint cannot be expected to last.
Trade is one of the few policy areas where he can be said to have an ideology.
The “logic” of that ideology holds that trade deficits are proof of unfair practices by other countries, and should thus be met with tough and decisive action.
Moreover, Trump has a compelling political interest in maintaining the support of his core supporters.
After Twitter, Trump’s trade rhetoric is his most powerful weapon.
It is never too early to start building a case for re-election in 2020.
Until now, Trump has been willing to hold back on the trade issue until the Republican Party’s planned tax overhaul makes its way through Congress. He does not want to risk disrupting his and his party’s last chance to secure a real legislative victory this year.
Once tax legislation is off the table – and especially if it fails ignominiously in the same manner as the Republicans’ health-care-reform effort earlier this year – Trump will want to show that he means what he has said on trade.
Trade is at the center of Trump’s “America First” approach, which he claims will protect and even restore lost American jobs.
While some in Trump’s cabinet might reject efforts to apply the slogan to the issues they oversee, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro all share Trump’s views on trade.
Each agrees that America’s big bilateral trade deficits with countries such as China, Japan, Germany, and Mexico are proof that America is being taken for a ride by its competitors.
Trump and his trade advisers believe that by reducing or even eliminating those deficits, they can create well-paid jobs for American workers.
Trump made his views clear in a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, on November 10.
“We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore,” he said.
“I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it.
They did not, but I will.”
But what concrete actions will Trump actually take?
So far, he has abandoned the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership – which his election opponent, Hillary Clinton, had also promised to do – and opened negotiations with Mexico and Canada to update the North American Free-Trade Agreement, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994.
This is minor stuff.
But next year, Trump can be expected to turn rhetoric into action on two main fronts. The first is China, which Trump has singled out as the greatest trade exploiter of the US.
Unless the North Korea standoff escalates critically, he will likely initiate anti-dumping actions against Chinese industries – notably in steel – deemed to be selling their goods below cost; and he will probably launch a broad assault on intellectual-property violations in China.
These measures will almost certainly provoke retaliation from China.
China feels stronger than ever in the Trump era, and in the eyes of Chinese cadres, not responding forcefully would be a sign of weakness.
The other main front for Trump is the World Trade Organization, which America helped establish in the early 1990s as a successor to the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Lighthizer has gone on record to describe the WTO’s dispute-settlement system as harmful to America.
And already, the Trump administration is blocking the appointment of new judges to WTO arbitration panels.
If it maintains that policy, the WTO’s entire dispute-settlement system will be crippled within months.
With the WTO essentially out of the picture, the US will launch a new initiative to strike bilateral deals on trade rules – an approach that Trump advocated in his APEC speech.
Given that the US remains a vital market for most exporters, such an initiative will have clout.
Asian and European countries, in particular, should be preparing for the worst by negotiating their own trade agreements with one another to preempt American mercantilism.
After all, taking the initiative to boost trade and other commercial contacts is the best way to resist a trade war.
By reviving the TPP without US involvement, Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries are already on the right track.
But if a Trump trade war is in the offing, they – and other countries – will need to double down on that approach.

Poverty, Social Spending, and IMF Programs: Myth vs. Reality
WASHINGTON, D.C.: An oft-repeated claim is that the IMF is responsible for increasing human misery in developing countries - in particular, by forcing countries to cut spending on programs like health and education.
But riots and repetition do not make such claims true.
At best, such accusations are out of date; at worst, they are ideological grandstanding.
The record, indeed, is clear: in 66 countries with IMF programs, between 1985 and 1998, per capita spending on health and education rose by more than 2% per year after inflation.
These numbers reflect the fact that IMF advice to countries facing budgetary pressures emphasizes the importance of sustaining expenditures on health and education. The Fund urges that savings be found in unproductive spending - meaning excessive military spending, subsidies for the well-to-do, and inefficient administrative practices.
Indeed, military spending (in the 41 countries where the IMF has data) fell by almost 1% of GDP between 1993 and 1997.
Low-income countries have posted larger gains in health and education spending than other countries under IMF programs.
This difference will become even more pronounced as increasing amounts of debt relief are delivered under the Initiative for Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), because a principal condition for this assistance is that money saved is channeled into poverty reduction.
In the past year, 10 of the 41 eligible countries have been granted debt relief under this initiative; we expect another 10 to start receiving debt relief by the end of this year.
Early participants like Bolivia and Uganda are seeing their debt service payments fall by as much as 1% of GDP, providing scope for a substantial increase in health and education spending.
In Tanzania, next year’s budget provides for a 44% increase in poverty-related spending.
Twenty years ago, it may have been true that IMF fiscal policy advice focused on the bottom line of a government’s accounts.
Over time, as it became increasingly clear that the burden of fiscal adjustment fell on those with the weakest voice - usually the poor - the IMF recognized that a focus on short-run fiscal outcomes was inadequate.
Since the late 1980’s, the Fund has regarded investment in human development as a way to promote sustained economic growth. Today, the IMF emphasizes protecting (or increasing) social expenditures for the poor, while making sure spending is well-targeted, and on improving governance mechanisms so that the voice of the poor is heard.
Of course, poverty reduction involves more than throwing money at a problem.
The quality and composition of social spending is just as important as the amount that is spent.
Social spending should be targeted at the needy.
In health and education, the poor often do not have good access to services.
In many of the HIPCs, we find heavy spending on urban hospitals and higher education relative to basic health care and primary education.
In these countries, only 14% of health and education spending benefits the poorest 20% of the population, while 30% of the spending goes to the richest 20%.
The need to target spending applies equally to social benefits.
Indonesia had large subsidies for cooking oil and other widely-consumed products, largely benefiting the middle class.
The IMF-supported program, despite heavy criticism, eliminated most of them. Instead, the money saved was ploughed back into better-targeted subsidies, such as a grade of rice mostly eaten by the poor.
To improve targeting to yield the largest possible reduction in poverty with the resources available, the IMF now expects all poor countries borrowing from the Fund to prepare comprehensive poverty reduction strategies.
Second, funds must be efficiently channeled to social expenditures.
Losses through corruption or excessive spending on program administration need to be minimized.
Here, improved transparency of government operations is vital.
Nigeria’s IMF-supported program, for example, embraces the Poverty Reduction Initiative, which aims to use funds productively and to ensure that the public funds for poverty reduction are accounted for in every quarter.
Finally, it must be recognized that - for whatever reason - even the best-intentioned policies do not necessarily translate into results. In countries with IMF programs, we know there have been positive outcomes.
School enrollment rates rose by 1% per year, and more quickly for girls than for boys, narrowing the gender gap.
Infant mortality fell by 22% per year, and even faster for children under 5.
Immunization rates rose by almost 5% per year.
Nevertheless, the IMF is not complacent, and seeks to ensure that policies deliver results.
It is a truism that a country’s future is its people, and promoting better health and education outcomes may be one of the soundest economic decisions a country can make. Still, giving priority to education and health care should not be at the expense of other public programs - such as sanitation and rural road-building - that may be just as important for reducing poverty.
We must not lose sight of the wood for the trees.
Much remains to be done to improve the lot of the poorest of the poor.
Indeed, there is much that we still don’t know about how to reduce poverty.
In many countries, even reliable data about the current state of affairs is hard to come by.
But the IMF is making every effort to help countries achieve the global objective of halving poverty by 2015, and as the numbers show, this is not just talk.

Victors’ Justice, Iraqi-Style
Saddam Hussein is dead, but not all Iraqis are celebrating.
On the contrary, the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity.
To the Shiite majority, long brutally oppressed by Saddam and all previous Sunni-dominated Iraqi regimes, Saddam’s death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony.
Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.
To the Sunni minority, pushed from power by the American invasion and giving vent to their frustration with daily attacks on the Shi’a population and their holy sites, Saddam will remain a hero for a long time to come.
The Kurds – who, like the Shi’a, were victimized by Saddam for decades – quietly cling to their de facto independence in the north, making sure that they will never again come under Arab rule.
Iraq’s prime minister, Nuri el-Maliki, representing the ruling Shi’a-Kurdish coalition, expressed the hope that the dictator’s end would help to heal the sectarian divides.
But, however sincere his words may sound, reality is moving in the opposite direction, and the ugly verbal exchanges surrounding the act of execution itself will certainly do little to dispel the notion that this was “victors’ justice” – the victors being not the United States, but the Shi’a.
None of this augurs well for the future of what we should get used to calling “the former Iraq.”
Indeed, the Washington debate surrounding how to “fix Iraq” is irrelevant, because something that does not exist any longer – namely, Iraq as a functioning state – cannot be fixed. Under the guise of US-inspired constitutional arrangements, the Shia majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power to itself.
Thus, what only a few months ago had looked from Washington like a successful transition to some sort of representative government is obviously a travesty: just as under Saddam, power today grows out of the barrel of the gun – only now the state does not hold a monopoly on the means of violence. Every militia, every ministry, every Shia political faction, has its own guns, goons, and death squads – while the Sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons they accumulated under Saddam to fight a rear-guard action against the new order, apparently legitimized by elections.
There is no power – save a new violent dictatorship – that can bring Shi’a, Sunnis, and Kurds to live once again in one body politic.
America’s chimerical dream of democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed only to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying array of political demons.
In these circumstances, the post-Baker-Hamilton debate in Washington is largely irrelevant to the future of Iraq – though it continues to be crucial to the future of US power, prestige, and standing in the world. The future of Iraq will be decided by the people of Iraq, but with bullets, not ballots.
The US and the entire international community are utterly unequipped to deal with this Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences.
And, unlike Yugoslavia’s successor states, which could look to Europe, the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic role model makes crafting a democratic order even more difficult.
Some Europeans and others may gloat over America’s failure in Iraq, and the ineptness – or worse – of US post-occupation policy cries to heaven. Yet the root causes of that failure go deeper, to Iraq’s creation as an artificial entity in the 1920’s by British imperialist planners, who stitched together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that never had a coherent identity.
Indeed, the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors’ justice: the British Empire, having vanquished the Ottomans, made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority.
That arrangement has now come unglued following another cycle of victors’ justice.
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear.
But a coherent Iraqi state – whether unitary, federal, or confederal – will not grow out of a society in which one part of the population views Saddam, rightly, as a gruesome oppressor, while another part reveres him as a hero and martyr.
Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies.
In Iraq, only now is it becoming evident that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed.

Capitalizing on Climate Unity
BONN – When Donald Trump was elected US president a year ago, some said the end of the Paris climate agreement was nigh. Yet, as the latest round of global climate talks in Bonn, Germany, has shown, the world’s political leaders are more committed to the deal than ever.
This is good news, but the fact remains that countries’ commitments do not yet add up to enough to turn the tide – and our window of opportunity to act effectively on climate change is rapidly closing.
Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States – the world’s largest historical carbon dioxide emitter – from the Paris agreement dealt the accord a major blow.
Many of America’s closest allies – including both of our countries, the Marshall Islands and Australia – were deeply disappointed by the move, which was shortsighted, for both America and the world.
But it is hard not to take heart from the fresh wave of global resolve Trump’s decision has unleashed, both globally and within the US itself.
Almost every major US state, city, and company has now pledged to do more to ensure that their country can meet its commitments, despite the Trump administration’s opposition.
The fact that climate action is now the worlds’ biggest economic opportunity has certainly helped.
According to the Trump administration’s own analysis, more than twice as many Americans are now working in the solar industry than in coal, oil, and gas combined.
And earlier this year, the OECD indicated that we could boost global growth by 5% per year by 2050, simply by linking the climate and growth agendas.
There is no time to waste; climate change has already arrived.
This year’s record-breaking drought in the Marshall Islands, apocalyptic storms in the Caribbean, and devastating floods in Bangladesh and the US demonstrate this.
As the United Nations Environment Programme recently reminded us, even if every country hits its existing 2030 emissions-reduction targets, we will be unable to limit warming to below 1.5° Celsius above preindustrial levels – the threshold, recognized in the Paris agreement, beyond which the impact of climate change becomes far greater.
Our chances even of staying within the more conservative – and dangerous – 2° Celsius limit will be slim.
To ignore this reality is to gamble with the existential future of many island countries, not to mention the prosperity of the global economy.
Without a sharp rise in global ambition for emissions reductions by 2020, we will be unable to save the world’s most vulnerable countries.
And if runaway climate change takes hold, no country will be immune to its effects.
Unfortunately, things will get a lot worse before they get better.
That is why we must step up our efforts to boost our resilience to the climate effects we won’t be able to avoid, and address the associated security consequences.
In the meantime, we must urgently increase the ambition of our climate commitments.
Fortunately, several upcoming events offer an opportunity to do just that.
We need to seize that opportunity with both hands.
Next month, French President Emmanuel Macron will host a conference to mark the two-year anniversary of the Paris agreement. And next September, California Governor Jerry Brown will host his own summit to galvanize greater action by cities, companies, and other non-state actors.
The biggest opportunity, however, will come in 2019, when UN Secretary-General António Guterres convenes world leaders in New York for the biggest climate gathering since the Paris talks.
We need to build an arc of ambition across these events that can, in the words of our friend Tony de Brum, the late Marshallese foreign minister and untiring climate warrior at the Paris conference, deliver a pathway to survival for the most vulnerable.
Some significant players are already going above and beyond their pledges.
A number of others, including the Marshall Islands, are set to bring forward new targets by 2020, to augment their current targets, which reach only as far as 2025.
Still others – including France, India, and New Zealand – have said informally that they are eager to do more.
The truth is that almost all countries have the capacity to do more, especially if the support is there and the opportunities are identified.
The imperative now is to create the right political conditions both to motivate and facilitate action. As more countries signal their ability to increase the ambition of their commitments, still more will follow.
At the same time, we must ensure that every sector, as well as every country, does its fair share.
This includes, for example, international shipping, which, if it were a country, would be the world’s sixth-largest emitter.
Next year’s “Talanoa Dialogue” – to be convened by Fiji, which last week became the first island state to chair UN climate talks – will help countries identify exactly how they can achieve the goals set in the Paris agreement.
That dialogue, which countries should approach in good faith, must be a springboard for further action.
To that end, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report laying out pathways for keeping the temperature rise below the 1.5°C threshold will be crucial.
The science remains key.
The Paris talks proved that political success is possible, if leaders are given the right platform, if civil society mobilizes behind them, and if the world acts in unison.
To get the rest of the way to a sustainable future, we must apply this lesson again.
The catchphrase at the Bonn conference was “further, faster, and together.”
Our collective challenge is to translate a nice-sounding slogan into reality.

Four Ways Out
BERKELEY – When an economy falls into a depression, governments can try four things to return employment to its normal level and production to its “potential” level.
Call them fiscal policy, credit policy, monetary policy, and inflation.
Inflation is the most straightforward to explain: the government prints up lots of banknotes, and spends them.
The extra cash in the economy raises prices.
As prices rise, people don’t want to hold cash in their pockets or their bank accounts – its value is melting away every day – so they step up the pace at which they spend, trying to get their wealth out of depreciating cash and into real assets that are worth something.
This spending pulls people out of unemployment and into jobs, and pushes capacity utilization up to normal and production up to “potential” levels.
But sane people would rather avoid inflation.
It is a very dangerous expedient, one that undermines standards of value, renders economic calculation virtually impossible, and redistributes wealth at random.
As John Maynard Keynes put it, “there is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose…” But governments will resort to inflation before they will allow another Great Depression – we just would very much rather not go there, if there is any alternative way to restore employment and production.
The standard way to fight incipient depressions is through monetary policy.
When employment and output threaten to decline, the central bank buys up government bonds for immediate cash, thus shortening the duration of the safe assets that investors hold. With fewer safe, money-yielding assets in the financial market, the price of safe wealth rises.
This makes it more worthwhile for businesses to invest in expanding their capacity, thus trading away cash they could distribute to their shareholders today for a better market position that will allow them to reward their shareholders in the future.
This boost in future-oriented spending today pulls people out of unemployment and pushes up capacity utilization.
The problem with monetary policy is that, in responding to today’s crisis, the world’s central banks have bought so many safe government bonds for so much cash that the price of safe wealth in the near future is absolutely flat – the nominal interest rate on government securities is zero.
Monetary policy cannot make safe wealth in the future any more valuable. And this is too bad, for if we could prevent a depression with monetary policy alone, we would do so, as it is the policy tool for macroeconomic stabilization that we know best and that carries the least risk of disruptive side effects.
The third tool is credit policy.
We would like to boost spending immediately by getting businesses to invest not only in projects that trade safe cash now for safe profits in the future, but also in those that are risky or uncertain.
But few businesses are currently able to raise money to do so.
Risky projects are at a steep discount today, because the private-sector financial market’s risk tolerance has collapsed.
No one is willing to buy assets and take on additional uncertainty, because everyone fears that somebody else knows more than they do – namely, that anyone would be a fool to buy.
Although the world’s central banks and finance ministries have been devising many ingenious and innovative policies to stimulate credit, so far they have not had much success.
This brings us to the fourth tool: fiscal policy. Have the government borrow and spend, thereby pulling people out of unemployment and pushing up capacity utilization to normal levels.
There are drawbacks: the subsequent deadweight loss of financing all the extra government debt that has been incurred, and the fear that too rapid a run-up in debt may discourage private investors from building physical assets, which form the tax base for the future governments that will have to amortize the extra debt.
But when you have only two tools left, neither of which is perfect for the job, the rational thing is to try both – credit policy and fiscal policy – at the same time.
That is what the Obama administration is attempting to do right now.

Getting Serious About European Defense
BRUSSELS – Russia’s war in Ukraine has forced the European Union to address longstanding strategic challenges.
The most immediate task is to end Europe’s dependence on Russian energy imports, and this process is now underway, with a gradual oil embargo that will reach 90% by the end of the year.
More broadly, Europe must also develop an effective security and defense policy, as well as the capabilities required to implement it.
While this ambition itself is not new, there is a fresh impetus for it.
Russia’s war makes clear that we need a step change toward greater pooling of defense investments.
That was the main conclusion from the European Council’s discussion about defense this week.
No two political problems are identical.
Sometimes, a challenge seems so new and unprecedented that it cannot be addressed until there has been a proper assessment of a changed landscape.
And sometimes, the solutions are known but the resources for them are lacking.
The European security and defense debate falls into a third category: the diagnosis and prescriptions are clear, but there has been a deficit of political will.
We have known for years – even decades – that European governments have been spending too little on defense, and in too fragmented a manner.
The result is that we lack the military capabilities to guarantee our own security or serve as a capable partner for NATO.
We need to spend more, and we need to do more of that spending together.
Over the years, many European politicians, institutions, defense ministries, think tanks, and others have issued reports and proposals calling for more and better defense spending.
These exhortations have reflected a clear and firm consensus among experts on the issue.
Moreover, in 2004, the EU created the European Defense Agency (EDA) to support member states with joint research, development, and procurement projects.
But many countries cut their defense spending following the 2008 financial crisis, reducing the shares of their budgets devoted to collaborative security investments.
Since then, governments have too often paid lip service to joint spending while continuing to put national procurement first (often for political reasons, such as to support domestic industries and employment).
The net result has been dramatic.
Between 2009 and 2018, member states’ cuts amounted to an aggregate defense underspending of around €160 billion ($171 billion).
Worse, many others around the world have raced ahead.
In the last 20 years, EU combined defense spending increased by only 20%, compared to 66% for the United States, almost 300% for Russia, and 600% for China.
Even more alarmingly, Europe reached a new low in 2021, when only 8% of equipment spending went toward collaborative investments – a far cry from the 35% that EU member states themselves have set as a target.
This underspending and lack of collaboration is costing EU countries (and thus taxpayers) tens of billions of euros per year, because of redundant spending and inefficiencies.
But it doesn’t have to be this way.
It is within our own power to change course, and we already know the way.
Through the Strategic Compass, EU institutions and all 27 member states have drawn up a roadmap.
We have tools and frameworks in place – starting with the Permanent Structured Cooperation and the European Defense Fund – to help member states pursue research, development, and investments in a more coordinated manner.
But other pieces still need to fall in place.
We must provide financial incentives for joint procurement and move toward more strategic programming.
We also need to strengthen the EU’s defense industrial and technological base by supporting research and development and harnessing the potential of disruptive new technologies.
As I told European leaders this week when they endorsed this approach, both the European Commission and the EDA can help with coordination.
Yes, it is a cliché in European politics to say that we lack only the political will to use the tools at our disposal.
But clichés are generally true.
We Europeans tend to make tough decisions only when we have tried everything else and are facing an acute crisis.
Those conditions have clearly been met.
We are watching Russia wage a brutal war of aggression against Ukraine – one that has underscored Europe’s own vulnerabilities, revealing longstanding capability deficits and new needs (such as to refill our depleted stocks).
Moreover, this crisis comes on top of many other threats, both in our own neighborhood and beyond.
European interests are being challenged in all strategic domains, including cyber, maritime, and space.
We need to develop the means to protect ourselves in a dangerous world.
That will require not just more defense spending but better defense spending.
To ensure our collective security, we must invest more together.

The Borgia Candidate for Russia’s Presidency
In the latest interview given by Andrei Lugovoi, the man Great Britain wants Russia to extradite for poisoning the dissident Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium, there was a remarkable moment that has not been fully appreciated.
Lugovoi, still rather diffident but with unmistakable pride, mentioned that when he is seen in public, he usually finds himself surrounded by people who want to shake his hand, congratulate him on his valor, and ask for his autograph.
“Well, have you thought about a career in politics?” the interviewer asked.
Unfortunately, the interviewer did not pursue the matter any further.
This is a pity, because Lugovoi’s status in Russia tells us much about my country in the seventh year of President Vladmir Putin’s rule.
Perhaps surprisingly, Lugovoi seems not to have wondered why he is enjoying such an enthusiastic reception from his compatriots.
Are ordinary Russians showing solidarity with a victim unjustly hounded by the British Crown Prosecution Service?
That seems unlikely.
When did Russians ever ask a victim for an autograph?
I myself have been attracting the interest of the Russian Public Prosecutor’s Office for several months now, and I have yet to encounter any public support in the street, let alone a single autograph hunter.
In Russia, you get asked for your autograph if you are a proper hero: an ice-hockey player, a cosmonaut, a high-society prostitute, or, like Lugovoi, an executioner.
Part of Lugovoi’s acclaim is derived from the fact that the list of unspeakable crimes committed by the late Alexander Litvinenko in the course of his brief life is growing longer in Russian media reports with every passing day.
These are crimes so treacherous that any right-minded Russian patriot can only thirst to see such a person subjected to the supreme measure of national retribution.
But only one such “patriot” was granted the honor of being allowed to perform this act.
That is why Lugovoi is being asked for his autograph.
This should not, of course, be taken to mean that the patriots gushing over Lugovoi’s achievement concede the justice of the British allegations.
The social awareness of Homo Putinicus, meticulously burnished by television propagandists, is such that pride in Lugovoi’s achievement and indignation at the infamous campaign unleashed against him by those who hate Russia can jangle within the breast of ordinary Russians without the slightest dissonance.
We are evidently facing the mystery of Russian thought that has proved so unfathomable to others, so unyielding to every analytical scalpel, and about which our Slavophiles and Eurasians wrote at length.
But I see a practical turn in all this that no one has yet broached.
Wouldn’t Lugovoi’s entrance into politics bring about the ideal solution to the problem of finding an heir for Putin?
That search, after all, is threatening to divide the nation’s elite.
So why not choose a man like Lugovoi who truly represents what that elite stands for?
Let us compare two potential presidential candidates, Putin in 1999 and Lugovoi in 2007.
The similarities are striking: the modest social background, the KGB milieu, the criminal vocabulary, the mentality and physique, the mercilessness towards “enemies of the people.”
The underworld manners of both go hand in hand with that lively interest in business which is so essential if “liberal reforms” in Russia are to be continued.
Finally, there is the additional, highly significant coincidence that both men, at the start of their political careers, were largely dependent on the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, but subsequently fell out with him.
Regarding their professional attainments, Lugovoi in 2007 seems to have the edge.
Successfully carrying out a large-scale operation in the middle of London beats a desk job in the GDR-USSR House of Friendship in Dresden in the years of perestroika and communist collapse.
So perhaps the Russian people might take to their hearts this executioner with the rank of lieutenant colonel, just as eight years ago they took to their hearts another KGB lieutenant colonel, Vladimir Putin?
Would the sybaritic, globe-trotting Lugovoi agree to wear the crown?
Running the Kremlin is, after all, a testing job.
We have all seen Putin’s face age dramatically over the last eight years.
But Lugovoi’s face, too, has also changed markedly over the last eight months of press conferences.
Once a wary non-entity, he has grown bolder.
His is the face of Putin’s new Russia, of a smug Russia that is “getting off its knees” and reaching for its gun.

A Bright Future for Africa’s Girls
LUSAKA – Education gives young people the tools they need – from cognitive and social skills to self-confidence – to succeed throughout their lives.
For many African countries, including my home country of Zambia, burgeoning youth populations make delivering high-quality education to all particularly urgent.
But success will be possible only with a sharp focus on girls and women.
Education plays a central role in determining girls’ and women’s capacity to claim economic, social, and political rights and status in society.
That is why it is so important that countries place the education and empowerment of girls and women at the top of their political agendas.
For Zambia, that decision is already paying off.
Women now occupy powerful positions previously dominated by men, including Chief Justice, Head of the Drug Enforcement Commission, President of the Constitutional Court, Vice President, and Finance Minister. Zambian President Edgar Lungu is experiencing his own “Blair’s babes” moment (British Prime Minister Tony Blair was once photographed surrounded by 96 of the 101 female Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons in 1997) without the patronizing slogan.
Of course, promoting gender equality is not just about getting women into the top levels of power.
Not everyone wants to or can be a CEO or political leader.
Gender equality is fundamentally about choice: giving women the same breadth of opportunities that men enjoy.
Education gives girls and women the knowledge they need to make informed choices about the life they want – to become a homemaker or scientific researcher, for example, or a small business owner or the head of a multinational corporation – and the skills they need to achieve it.
To support this effort, Zambia’s government has increased its investment in building technical secondary schools for girls.
Moreover, to boost education quality, it has been recruiting teachers, with a focus on women.
So far, 1,265 female teachers have been hired, compared to 744 male teachers.
The Zambian government has also strengthened its “re-entry policy,” focused on helping young mothers return to school after childbirth.
And it is buttressing its efforts with legislation, including the Gender Equity and Equality Act and an amendment to the Zambian Constitution Act.
A bill to curb sexual and gender-based violence is also in the pipeline.
Zambia’s progress challenges outsiders’ assumptions about what it means to be a woman in Africa.
It should serve as a model for neighboring countries seeking to bolster development by improving gender equality, and as a source of hope for girls and women everywhere, giving them the confidence to dream big.
But our work is far from finished.
We not only need more women to be playing decisive roles at all levels of society; we must also close educational-attainment gaps between, say, urban and rural girls.
Nevertheless, the future looks bright.
For one thing, with the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 4, United Nations member states have committed to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030, with a focus on eliminating gender disparities.
For another, high-profile figures have thrown their weight behind initiatives promoting education – and, in particular, girls’ education.
Notably, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is now a patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the only accredited organization representing higher education (more than 500 universities) throughout more than 50 Commonwealth countries.
Among the ACU’s key areas of work is gender equity.
This is an obvious fit for the duchess, a vocal feminist, who has used her platform to encourage the empowerment of young women, including through education. For example, speaking to a group of students at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji last October, she declared, “Everyone should be afforded the opportunity to receive the education they want, but more importantly the education they have the right to receive.”
She then underscored the added importance of this objective for “women and girls in developing countries.”
The duchess has previously worked with organizations like One World Vision and has been an ambassador for UN Women.
Perhaps most important, she has the star quality that captures young people’s attention.
With her compelling personal story – in which she found her own success, lived her values, and defied expectations – she is the epitome of the modern woman, and an inspiration to girls and women throughout Africa.
The advocacy of figures like the Duchess of Sussex, together with a strong commitment from governments and NGOs, suggests that the future of our young girls is bright.
Now more than ever, African women can look forward to lives they choose for themselves.

Terror vs. Liberty
The terrorism that we have come to associate with Al Qaeda is special in many ways.
It is global, technologically sophisticated, but, above all, it is not about an achievable political objective.
It is not aimed at creating a united (Catholic) Ireland, an independent Basque country, or even a Palestinian state, but at a particular worldview and those who represent it.
It is aimed at what used to be called the West, that is, a liberal order of things, a free world.
Because the United States is the most visible and powerful representative of that free world, it is aimed against America and its closest allies in Europe and elsewhere.
This is a critical fact to remember.
What we describe under the heading of Al Qaeda is an essentially negative, destructive movement.
It does not offer an alternative view of the modern world other than the implicit claim that modernity is neither necessary nor desirable.
Moreover, that claim, when made by men who appear to be religious leaders, is almost certainly dishonest.
Such leaders are using religion for their own highly modern political purposes; they use it to organize and mobilize their supporters - to commit individual or collective suicide, if need be. In this they are not entirely dissimilar from the totalitarian leaders of fascist movements, who likewise built on popular frustration to pursue an essentially destructive purpose in the name of anti-modern beliefs and promises.
Violence born from such sources is difficult to fight.
Signs of frustration with modernity are never hard to find.
They are present in highly developed countries, but above all in entire regions of the world that are suspended between a yesterday that no longer exists and a tomorrow that has not yet come into being.
How, then, do free countries deal with terrorist expressions of organized frustration?
Without doubt, the first priority for any free country must be to protect its citizens and assets against acts of terrorist violence.
Given a globalized movement of fury, this is not simple.
It requires measures that do not come easily to citizens, groups, and authorities steeped in a tradition of liberalism and tolerance.
We must accept that there are limits to tolerance.
Opting out of the values and customs of free societies is problematic, but it is ultimately acceptable.
Non-aggressive demonstrations of difference - including Islamic headscarves worn by students or teachers in largely Christian countries - should be bearable.
But violence should never be tolerated.
The monopoly on the use of violence exercised by democratic states must be preserved, which may involve expelling non-citizens who choose violence or advocate its use, and the detention of citizens who have practiced or threatened it.
However, it is of critical importance that the treatment of terrorists and those suspected of terrorist acts remains strictly within the rule of law. Indefinite detention without trial is as unacceptable as defining people as "illegal combatants," to whom no rules of any kind apply.
The status of the prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay and the recent incidents of possibly systematic humiliation and torture of Iraqi prisoners cast doubt on the very values on which a liberal order is based.
Such incidents make one wonder whether the terrorists have, in the end, achieved their aim of destroying the West and what it stands for.
Terrorism aimed at the destruction of the liberal order is a test of that order.
This is particularly so if one accepts - as I do - intervention in the internal affairs of countries in order to prevent genocide or the murderous suppression of minorities and opposition groups.
But intervention must never borrow methods from those against whom it is undertaken.
This applies also to the intervening powers' objectives.
Terrorism of the Al Qaeda type is basically destructive.
Any response must be basically constructive.
The frustration of many in the economically developed countries is, like the frustration of entire countries in developing regions, a challenge.
This challenge cannot really be met by simply promising unlimited opportunities, as they uniquely exist in America.
It requires a sense of social responsibility that accompanies and cushions the painful process of modernization.
People who are suspended between a lost past and a future not yet gained need help.
Such assistance will not yield immediate results, but awareness of the medium term - which means readiness to face it by delaying immediate gratification - is also a sign of a liberal order.
Thus, fighting Al Qaeda is not a war.
It is partly self-defense, partly an assertion of the rule of law in difficult circumstances, and partly a constructive effort to redress the causes of frustration.

Strategies for Responsible Gene Editing
CAMBRIDGE – The discovery of a powerful new tool capable of addressing health and environmental problems as diverse as malaria, Lyme disease, and invasive species should be a cause for celebration.
But, because the tool, called CRISPR, can alter entire populations of wild organisms (and thus shared ecosystems), ensuring that these interventions are developed responsibly poses an unprecedented challenge for science and society.
Humans have been altering animals and plants through selective breeding for millennia; but, because these changes typically reduce the capacity for survival and reproduction in the wild, they do not spread to wild populations. Alterations accomplished using CRISPR, which enables scientists to edit a cell’s DNA with unprecedented precision, are different in one crucial respect: The process can result in “gene drive,” a naturally occurring feature of some genes that enables them to spread through a population over generations, even if they do not help survival (and thus reproduction).
Simply put, we can now contemplate altering wild populations in very specific and consequential ways.
Those changes can be highly positive.
By altering certain features of mosquitos, we could reduce or even eradicate ancient scourges such as malaria and dengue that afflict hundreds of millions of people each year.
(Malaria alone kills a child every 90 seconds, on average.)
By permanently immunizing the relevant animal populations, we could prevent new cases of Lyme and other diseases that originate in wild organisms, or we could block newly emergent pathogens such as the Zika virus, which has been linked to an epidemic of stunted brain development in newborns in Latin America.
As for the environment, human activities have already impacted every ecosystem on Earth, with far-reaching consequences – for us and many other species – many of which are yet to unfold. Gene drive elements could potentially reverse much of this damage.
For example, limiting invasive species – such as cane toads in Australia, mosquitoes in Hawaii, or rats and mice almost everywhere – could help to restore damaged biomes.
And eliminating pests’ attraction to our crops, without diminishing their capacity to fulfill their other ecological roles, would remove the need for toxic pesticides.
As we attempt to realize these tremendous potential benefits, however, we must bear in mind that the effects of gene drive interventions will be shared by entire communities.
Given the vast complexity of ecosystems, careful research will be needed to assess the consequences of each intervention before proceeding.
CRISPR gene drives also highlight a problem that goes beyond ecology: Existing systems for developing and evaluating new technologies are woefully inadequate for powerful new tools with broad impacts.
It should be self-evident that technologies like gene drives, which don’t require widespread adoption to have a widespread effect, should never be released without informed community consent.
Yet history shows the opposite pattern, with decision-making seldom factoring in environmental consequences or citizens’ opinions.
Nowadays, there are few opportunities for public input until after products are developed, when it is typically too late to make changes.
By ignoring potentially helpful contributions from an increasingly knowledgeable public, closed-door technological development has precluded balanced assessments and created acrimony – a dangerously irresponsible and wasteful outcome for both science and society.
CRISPR gene drives offer an opportunity to chart a new course.
For starters, public notification and broadly inclusive discussions should always precede and inform development of gene drive interventions in the lab.
A clear description of the potential impact of an experiment – as my colleagues and I have provided for the technology as a whole – must be followed by transparency throughout the development process.
This community-guided approach to research provides opportunities to identify and address potential problems and concerns during development. If a perceived problem cannot be adequately addressed, researchers should be prepared to terminate the project.
Transparency and collective scrutiny would also help to ensure that scientists fulfill their fundamental responsibility to protect against laboratory accidents. Experiments involving gene drive organisms are almost unique in terms of the potential harm that a mishap could cause beyond the lab.
Though DNA-level changes spread by one gene drive can be overwritten by another gene drive – an important safeguard against unwanted side effects and misuse – the ecological impacts would not be so easy to reverse.
To be sure, most gene drive experiments will pose little, if any, environmental risk.
Nonetheless, an accidental release would prove devastating to public confidence in researchers' ability to develop this powerful technology with wisdom and humility.
That is why my colleagues and I have detailed, demonstrated, and publicized several easily implementable confinement strategies.
Another feature of a responsible approach would be a commitment by scientists to evaluate each proposed gene drive intervention – say, immunizing mice so that they cannot transmit Lyme disease to ticks – individually, rather than making a blanket decision on the technology as a whole.
After all, the benefits and risks of each intervention would be entirely different.
A final safeguard against the irresponsible development of gene drive technology is to ensure that early interventions are developed exclusively by governments and nonprofit organizations.
Given the potential of financial incentives to skew the design and results of safety tests, keeping the profit motive out of the development and decision-making processes will encourage balanced assessments.
The bottom line is that existing models for technological development are inadequate for technologies with broadly shared effects.
Only with early discussion, transparent research, careful safeguards, and community guidance can we build a responsive model of scientific development well suited to ecological technologies.
Given the life-saving (and environment-saving) potential of CRISPR gene drive interventions, let us determine how to develop them – and when to decline to do so – together.

Which Asian Century?
NEW YORK – It has become something of a cliché to predict that Asia will dominate the twenty-first century.
It is a safe prediction, given that Asia is already home to nearly 60% of the world’s population and accounts for roughly 25% of global economic output.
Asia is also the region where many of this century’s most influential countries – including China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, and the United States – interact.
But to point to Asia’s growing importance says nothing about its character.
There can be two, very different Asian centuries, and the one that emerges will have profound consequences for the region’s peoples and governments – and for the world.
One future is an Asia that is relatively familiar: a region whose economies continue to enjoy robust levels of growth and manage to avoid conflict with one another.
The second future could hardly be more different: an Asia of increased tensions, rising military budgets, and slower economic growth. Such tensions could spill over and impede trade, tourism, and investment, especially if incidents occur between rival air or naval forces operating in close proximity over or around disputed waters and territories.
Cyberspace is another domain in which competition could get out of hand.
The question is this: Will twenty-first-century Asia resemble Europe – the dominant region of much of modern history – during the first half of the twentieth century, when it experienced two wars of unprecedented cost and destruction, or the second half, when tensions with the Soviet Union were effectively managed and Western Europe experienced unprecedented peace and prosperity?
The reference to Europe is instructive, because Europe did not just get lucky.
History unfolded as it did only because its political leaders demonstrated great vision and discipline.
As a result, long-term adversaries like France and Germany were reconciled within a region-wide project – first a coal and steel community, which expanded to become the European Economic Community and, ultimately, the European Union – that integrated the continent politically and economically to such an extent that violent conflict was rendered unthinkable.
All of this is worth considering, because few parallels are to be found in contemporary Asia.
On the contrary, the region is notable for a lack of meaningful regional agreements and institutions, particularly in the political-military and security spheres.
Moreover, a marked lack of reconciliation and settlement of long-standing disputes makes it all too easy to imagine not only a military incident involving two or more neighbors, but also the possibility that such an incident leads to something larger.
Many of these disputes date back to World War II, or even before.
Korea and China harbor strong anti-Japanese sentiment.
There is no Russia-Japan peace treaty, and the two countries have competing claims over the Kuril Islands (known as the Northern Territories to the Japanese).
The border between China and India is also a matter of contention.
In fact, the regional security climate has worsened in recent years.
One reason is the continued division of the Korean Peninsula and the threat that a nuclear-armed North Korea poses to its own people and its neighbors.
China has added to regional tensions with a foreign policy – including advancing territorial claims in the East and South China Seas – that would be described diplomatically as “assertive,” and more bluntly as “bullying.”
Meanwhile, Japan appears determined to extricate itself from many of the military constraints imposed on it (and, until recently, embraced by the vast majority of Japanese) as a result of its aggressive behavior in the 1930’s and 1940’s.
These developments both reflect and reinforce heightened nationalism throughout the region.
What is needed is more intense bilateral diplomacy among Asian governments to settle long-standing disputes.
From there, regional pacts that promote free trade and contend with climate change should be negotiated.
Finally, a regional forum should be established to regulate better the deployment of military force, including confidence-building measures to reduce the risk of incidents and to help manage them if they occur.
Some of what is needed can be modeled on what Europe has achieved.
But Europe is relevant for another reason: Europeans have succeeded in maintaining stability and building great prosperity for the last seven decades in no small part because of the American presence and role.
The United States, an Atlantic power, was fully integrated into the region’s economic and security arrangements.
Something along these lines is likely to be no less critical for Asia, where the US, which is also a Pacific power, has vital interests and deep commitments.
America’s strategic “pivot” to Asia thus needs to be substantial and lasting.
This will require that successive US administrations emphasize free trade, increase America’s air and naval presence, and invest in diplomacy designed to promote China’s integration within the region on terms consistent with the interests of the US, its allies (Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia), and its many friends.
The alternative is an Asia left to its own devices – and an Asian century that is dominated by China or characterized by frequent bouts of diplomatic tension or even conflict.
Few in Asia or beyond would benefit from such a future.

Turkey and Europe: Two Trains on a Collision Course?
By intervening in Lebanon, Europeans have made a far-reaching, risk-fraught, and, at the same time, correct decision.
The reason is that the future of Europe’s security will be determined in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.
Europe, whether it likes it or not, has taken on a new, strategic role in the region.
Should it fail, the price will be high.
In view of the serious risks that Europe has assumed, in full awareness of the consequences, it is of the utmost importance that a European “Grand Strategy” for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East be developed, so that Europe can calmly and clearly define its interests.
In any serious variation of this Grand Strategy, Turkey will need to play a central role – politically, militarily, economically, and culturally.
Safeguarding Europe’s interests today means establishing a strong link – indeed an unbreakable bond – with Turkey as a cornerstone of regional security.
So it is astonishing that Europe is doing exactly the opposite: firmly closing its eyes to the strategic challenge posed by Turkey.
Successful modernization and democratization of Turkey – with a strong civil society, the rule of law, and a modern economy – will not only be hugely beneficial for Turkey, but will also export stability and serve as a model for transformation in the Islamic world.
Above all, the successful modernization of a large Muslim country will make a decisive contribution to Europe’s security.
Since the days of Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, the modernization of Turkey has relied on its Western or European perspective.
For the last 43 years, this perspective has been largely defined by Turkey’s interest in joining the European Union and by the EU’s promise of accession.
But at the very moment when even slightest glance at the crisis-ridden region on Europe’s eastern flank – Iran, Iraq, Syria, the Middle East conflict, Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus, Islamic terrorism, emigration, and threats to Europe’s energy supplies – should make clear Turkey’s paramount importance to European security, Europe is reveling in its disinterest in the state of European-Turkish relations.
This autumn, the European Commission is scheduled to issue a progress report on accession negotiations with Turkey.
A dangerous situation may well emerge, as this report threatens to derail the whole process.
The key dispute is over Cyprus.
Turkey has refused to open its ports, airports, and roads to the Republic of Cyprus, as it is obligated to do by the Ankara Protocol, which set the terms of Turkey’s accession negotiations.
Turkey explains its refusal by the EU’s failure (as a result of a veto by the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia) to fulfill its own promise to open up trade with Northern Cyprus, which is under Turkish rule.
The EU made these promises at the Council of Europe in December 2003 and formally at the Council of Foreign Ministers in April 2004.
But so far it has not fulfilled them.
So it is Ankara – and not the EU! – that has a legitimate point here.
When the Ankara Protocol was agreed, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan achieved something that, until then, had been considered impossible: he shattered the decades-old opposition of Turkish Cypriots to a compromise between the two parts of the divided island.
Turkish Northern Cyprus accepted UN Secretary General Kofi Annan’s plan (massively supported by the EU) to resolve the long-standing conflict.
But the Greek South, goaded and inflamed by its government, rejected it. It would be deeply unjust and outright foolish if the EU Commission’s report holds Turkey responsible for its refusal to make further concessions to Greek Cyprus (now an EU member), while refusing to blame the government in Nicosia, which is the real cause of the blockage.
Some in the EU – mainly in France, Germany, and Austria – seem smugly pleased by the prospect of a clash on this issue, believing it will force Turkey to give up its drive for membership.
But this attitude is irresponsible.
The EU is about to commit a grave strategic error by allowing its report this autumn to be guided by the short-sighted domestic policy considerations of some of its important member states.
And what perspective would Turkey have outside the EU?
Pan-Turkish illusions?
A return to the Orient and to Islam?
None of these will work.
But Turkey will not sit idly on Europe’s doorstep.
Europe’s attitude is pushing Turkey towards forging alliances with its traditional regional rivals, Russia and Iran.
These three powers, each of great importance to Europe, have been rivals for many centuries.
So an alliance between them would seem a near impossibility.
Yet Europe seems bent on achieving the impossible, to the Continent’s detriment.
Within Turkey, opinion polls suggest that frustration with Europe is intensifying, while Iran is viewed with increasing favor.
A sense of alienation towards the West is spreading, and Turkey’s diplomatic relations with Russia have reached a hitherto unknown intimacy.
Of course, there is vast domestic resistance to Turkey’s accession to the EU.
The final result of the accession process is therefore an open question for both sides.
Admittedly, Turkey has a long way to go.
But to endanger this process here and now, in full awareness of the possible costs, is an act of very costly stupidity on the part of the Europeans – and stupidity is the worst sin in politics.
In European-Turkish relations, two trains are racing headlong towards each other.
Neither Turkey nor Europe can afford the all-too-foreseeable crash.

Neo-Liberalism Meets Neo-Confucianism
The West has dominated the world ever since the industrial revolution.
Today that dominance seems threatened by the East Asian heirs to Confucianism, the ideology par excellence of state cohesion.
Centuries of inculcation with Confucianism was as important to the rise of East Asia’s hyper-growth economies as the conjunction of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism was to the west.
Confucianism’s tenets still provide an inner compass to most East Asians in a post-Confucian age, just as Biblical admonitions remain standards for the West in a post-religious age.
The basic thrust of Confucianism has changed little since Confucius’s disciples recorded his aphorisms a generation before Socrates.
Indeed, Confucianism became the official ideology of the Chinese state two centuries before the birth of Christ.
Confucianism was essentially a philosophical justification of government by benevolent bureaucracy under a virtuous ruler.
Virtue ensured harmony between man and nature, as well as obedience within a stratified society.
As one Confucian classic put it: Possessing virtue will give the ruler the people.
Possessing the people will give him the territory.
Possessing the territory will give him its wealth.
Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.
Virtue is the root; wealth is the result.
During the neo-Confucian renaissance of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, a metaphysical dimension was added to fill a gap exposed by Buddhism’s inroads into China.
Thereafter, a good Confucian could, with untroubled conscience, scorn the Buddhist renunciation of the world.
This restatement of fundamental precepts restored Confucianism to a primacy in China and neighboring states that remained unchallenged for 700 years.
Neo-Confucianism provided the basic ideology for China’s admiring neighbors – Japan, Korea, and Vietnam – until the advent of the West.
Its tenets were highly appropriate to the settled, sophisticated agrarian civilizations of pre-nineteenth-century East Asia, for they knitted together society and polity in a manner calculated to promote stability and harmony.
The ultimate guarantee of harmony was the ruler’s justness, which permitted him to enjoy the “mandate of heaven”; the people had a right, indeed an obligation, to rebel against a tyrant.
But while the ethical basis of Neo-Confucianism was crucial, the Chinese also understood the need for a morally motivated bureaucracy, and thus perfected in the seventh century the world’s first examination system for selecting bureaucrats, with the Confucian canon as the syllabus.
Of course, the Neo-Confucian system was not immune to mankind’s appetites.
Many Confucian emperors were brutal.
Yet stability was achieved.
There was only one change of dynasty in China between 1368 and the end of the imperial era in 1911.
The Tokugawa Shoguns, who completed the reunification of Japan in 1600, remained in power for more than two and a half centuries.
In Korea, the Yi dynasty ruled from 1382 until the Japanese conquest of 1910.
Periodic civil strife and rebellion were not eliminated, but only in Vietnam was the longevity of a dynasty a cloak for inextinguishable internecine warfare.
Like a happy and secure childhood, Confucian civilization bestowed upon its practitioners the self-confidence to meet the challenge of the West.
Since Confucianism was essentially an agnostic ideology, concerned with the management of the visible world, the post-Confucians experienced little of the spiritual angst that afflicted Hindus, Muslims, and Christians in their collision with the “materialism” of industrial society.
Confucian civic culture also provided the basis for a long history of successful self-government.
East Asians entered the modern world of nation states in self-consciously discrete secular units.
By contrast, the Indian subcontinent, with two major religions and a dozen major linguistic groups, was united in modern times only under British rule.
Applied learning is the key to the post-Confucian states’ success.
Confucian literati, shunning manual labor, grew their fingernails long, but they never displayed antipathy towards the world of affairs.
The Chinese myth of success was the bright peasant boy whose village clubbed together to educate him and whose subsequent success resulted in the elevation of all who had helped him on his way into the civil service.
Ideally, state and family were mirror images.
The emperor was the supreme paterfamilias, his benevolent rule reciprocated by the obedience of his ministers and subjects, while family members were fixed in their appropriate hierarchical relationships.
Families and nations that obeyed together stayed together.
Meiji Japan grasped the advantages of making the nation a macrocosm of the family.
An imperial order in 1890 outlined the objectives of education: the Confucian concepts of loyalty, obedience, and filial piety were to be transferred from the family to the nation.
At about the same time, the Chinese scholar Yen Fu – whose translations of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, and Montesquieu were read even by the young Mao – also concluded that filial piety fostered habits of disciplined subordination to authority that could be applied to the factory and the polity.
During the past century, the post-Confucian states have accustomed themselves to a pluralistic world of theoretically equal nation states.
But it is difficult to know how deep that adjustment has gone.
If the West is perceived to be attempting to maintain the leadership it snatched 200 years ago by industrializing first, thereby denying the post-Confucians the fruits of their dynamism permanently, the Chinese, in particular, will conclude that pluralism is eyewash and that the West’s worldview in fact replicates their traditional one.
Today’s trade and currency battles would then become a Kulturkampf.
In a few decades, when China’s economy equals America’s in size, the winner will be hard to pick.
Better for the West to accept equality now – and struggle to maintain it.

Derek Chauvin and America’s Racial Reckoning
NEW YORK – The start of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has returned the spotlight to the racial reckoning that accelerated after May 25, 2020, when Chauvin’s knee ended George Floyd’s life.
Since then, massive urban protests, the toppling of Confederate statuary, and culture wars on university campuses have led many to believe that a semblance of racial justice in America might finally be achieved.
But to produce true and lasting change, America’s governing institutions will need to become directly involved.
Recognizing this, Representative Barbara Lee of California and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey have introduced resolutions calling for a “US Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation.” And Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and 169 co-sponsors have introduced H.R.40, which calls for the creation of a national commission to examine the legacy of racial injustice in the United States – from slavery to the policing and carceral abuses of the present.
More to the point, the commission created under H.R.40 would ultimately address the controversial question of reparations for the descendants of slaves.
Though reparations have become a hot-button culture-war issue, Americans would do well to remember that the US government has already adopted such a policy.
Under President George H.W. Bush, and then under President Bill Clinton, around 82,000 Japanese-Americans who had been interned in the US during World War II received reparations checks.
During the 2020 presidential election campaign, then-candidate Joe Biden promised to pursue a “reckoning” not just with words, but through structural changes to right some of the wrongs of racial discrimination.
“It will take more than talk,” he said, “Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.” Now that he is in the White House, Biden’s leadership could be crucial in garnering wider – potentially even bipartisan – support for bills like the one Lee has introduced.
To understand what America’s racial reckoning could look like, we can turn to the experiences of other countries that have formally dealt with historical injustices.
Here, one thinks of Argentina’s “Never Again” Truth Commission or the restorative-justice processes pursued in post-apartheid South Africa and Chile after Augusto Pinochet.
After the establishment of a nascent democracy, each of these countries took steps to investigate, document, and redress the previous regime’s abuses. The idea is that a society can advance into a more inclusive future only by drawing a clear line under the past.
To be effective, a US commission on racial reckoning and structural injustice would have to be nonpartisan, bringing in trusted representatives of all social groups, and allow for comprehensive fact-finding in addition to remedial measures.
Hearing from victims of segregation and mass incarceration, the families of survivors, and historians of slavery could help to focus public attention and clarify contested narratives, with testimony publicized through televised hearings, social media, and other channels.
Beyond procedural issues, the more difficult question concerns the ultimate purpose of such proceedings.
In the absence of a widespread consensus about America’s history of racial injustice, one obvious objective is to work toward national unity.
But will unity still be possible if the process includes a financial element like reparations?
Much may depend on the scope of such compensation; in the case of Japanese-American internees, it was rather narrow.
Equally pertinent is whether the process will include criminal immunity for those who admit culpability for past crimes.
In South Africa, disclosures of apartheid-era violence were traded for amnesty.
Similarly, in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement, Catholics and Protestants both agreed to the release of imprisoned partisans.
And most recently, cooperation with Colombia’s Truth Commission brought lighter penalties for FARC guerrillas and also for soldiers and members of right-wing paramilitaries.
The point of consulting these examples is not to draw direct comparisons to the US.
Each country’s situation is unique, and so must be the process through which it redresses past wrongs.
Still, one common element in past reconciliations is the importance of timing. Efforts that would fail at one point can succeed once the underlying cultural and political conditions change.
And, once launched, truth and reconciliation processes can justify themselves by educating the public and breaking impasses that have long stood in the way of accountability.
In the US, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris (herself a former prosecutor) rode to the White House on a massive wave of support that included many new voters.
After being elected with a clear mandate, Biden’s approval remains well over 50% – a threshold that Donald Trump never passed.
And, like Nelson Mandela, Václav Havel, and Raúl Alfonsín (Argentina’s first democratically elected president after the fall of the military dictatorship), Biden and Harris campaigned on the promise of pursuing accountability and national unity.
But while Biden personally has expressed support for a commission to study the question of reparations, a Reuters/Ipsos poll last summer found that most Americans – including one-third of Democrats – oppose the idea that the US should use “taxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people.”
It remains to be seen if political leadership and an open process of fact-finding can change people’s minds.
But sooner or later, Americans will have to recognize that the only way to move forward is to grapple with what lies behind them.

Global Silence on China’s Gulag
NEW DELHI – For more than two years, China has waged a campaign of unparalleled repression against its Islamic minorities, incarcerating an estimated one-sixth of the adult Muslim population of the Xinjiang region at one point or another.
Yet, with the exception of a recent tweet from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on China to “end its repression,” the international community has remained largely mute.
In its reliance on mass detention, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has followed the Soviet Union’s example.
But China’s concentration camps and detention centers are far larger and more technologically advanced than their Soviet precursors, and their purpose is to indoctrinate not just political dissidents, but an entire community of faith.
Although independent researchers and human-rights groups have raised awareness of practices such as force-feeding Muslims alcohol and pork, the Chinese authorities have been able to continue their assault on Islam with impunity.
Even as China’s security agencies pursue Uighurs and other Muslims as far afield as Turkey, Chinese leaders and companies involved in the persecution have not faced international sanctions or incurred any other costs.
Chief among the culprits, of course, is Chinese President Xi Jinping, who in 2014 ordered the policy change that set the stage for today’s repression of ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and members of other Muslim groups.
The forcible assimilation of Muslims into the country’s dominant Han culture is apparently a cornerstone of Xiism – or “Xi Jinping Thought” – the grand “ism” that Xi has introduced to overshadow the influence of Marxism and Maoism in China.
To oversee this large-scale deprogramming of Islamic identities, Xi, who has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, reassigned the notorious CPC enforcer Chen Quanguo from Tibet to Xinjiang and elevated him to the all-powerful Politburo. Though Chen’s record of overseeing human-rights abuses is well known, the Trump administration has yet to act on a bipartisan commission’s 2018 recommendation that he and other Chinese officials managing the gulag policy be sanctioned.
In general, financial and trade interests, not to mention the threat of Chinese retribution, have deterred most countries from condemning China’s anti-Muslim policies.
With the exception of Turkey, even predominantly Muslim countries that were quick to condemn Myanmar for its treatment of Rohingya Muslims have remained conspicuously silent on China.
While Pakistan’s military-backed prime minister, Imran Khan, has feigned ignorance about the Xinjiang crackdown, Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has gone so far as to defend China’s right to police “terrorism.”
Emboldened by the muted international response, China has stepped up its drive to Sinicize Xinjiang by demolishing Muslim neighborhoods.
In Urumqi and other cities, once-bustling Uighur districts have been replaced with heavily policed zones purged of Islamic culture.
The irony is that while China justifies its “reeducation hospitals” as necessary to cleanse Muslim minds at home of extremist thoughts, it is effectively supporting Islamist terrorism abroad.
For example, China has repeatedly blocked UN sanctions against Masood Azhar, the head of the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group responsible for carrying out serial attacks in India, including on Parliament and, most recently, on a paramilitary police convoy.
As Pompeo tweeted, “The world cannot afford China’s shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN.”
An added irony is that while China still harps on its “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign imperial powers, it has for decades presided over the mass humiliation of minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet.
Ominously, by systematically degrading Muslim populations, it could be inspiring white supremacists and other Islamaphobes around the world. For example, the Australian extremist arrested for the recent twin mosque massacres in Christchurch, New Zealand, declared an affinity for China’s political and social values.
There has been a good deal of reporting about how China has turned Xinjiang into a laboratory for Xi’s Orwellian surveillance ambitions.
Less known is how Xi’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative is being used as a catalyst for the crackdown.
According to Chinese authorities, the establishment of a surveillance state is necessary to prevent unrest in the province at the heart of the BRI’s overland route.
Like Marxism-Leninism, Nazism, Stalinism, and Maoism, which left millions of people dead, Xiism promises to impose significant long-term costs on untold numbers of innocent people.
It is the impetus behind China’s ruthless targeting of minority cultures and communities, as well as its aggressive expansion into international waters and introduction of digital totalitarianism.
Thanks to Xiism, the world’s largest, strongest, and oldest autocracy finds itself at a crossroads.
As the People’s Republic of China approaches its 70th birthday, its economy is slowing amid escalating capital flight, trade disruptions, and the emigration of wealthy Chinese.
The Chinese technology champion Huawei’s international travails augur difficult times ahead.
The last thing China needs right now is more enemies.
Yet Xi has used his unbridled power to expand China’s global footprint and lay bare his imperial ambitions.
His repression of Muslim minorities may or may not lead to international action against China.
But it will almost certainly spawn a new generation of Islamist terrorists, compounding China’s internal-security challenges.
China’s domestic security budget is already larger than its bloated defense budget, which makes it second only to the United States in terms of military spending.
The Soviet Union once held the same position – until it collapsed.

The Submerging-Market Threat
WASHINGTON, DC – It is time to put the rise of the emerging economies in perspective.
The rapid economic growth in much of the developing world since the beginning of the century was fueled by a commodity boom and an overextension of credit.
But, because the emerging-market boom was not accompanied by sufficient structural reforms, it was not sustainable.
Today, most of the major emerging economies have experienced a severe reversal of fortune.
Russia and Brazil have plunged into severe crises, with double-digit inflation accompanying a 4% contraction in GDP last year.
South Africa is barely growing.
China’s phenomenal rate of expansion has slowed to below 7%.
Unsurprisingly, Goldman Sachs has closed its money-losing BRIC fund for investment in Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
Indeed, the future of the BRICS (including South Africa) – and that of other emerging markets – looks gloomy. Outside of Asia, most developing economies are principally commodity exporters, and thus are highly exposed to price shocks.
Plunging oil prices have cut the value of the Russian ruble by more than half against the US dollar, and further declines appear likely – especially if the US Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates.
Commodity prices are likely to stay low for one or two decades, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s.
When it comes to oil, for example, shale gas, tight oil, liquefied natural gas, and increasingly competitive solar and wind energy are boosting energy supply, even as a decade of high prices has spurred conservation and reduced demand.
The commodity crunch is likely to prove painful to people in emerging markets, who often measure their income in US dollars. As exchange rates fall, they will quickly feel much poorer.
Governments will suffer, too, as their foreign debt – boosted by fiscal and monetary expansion that yielded little growth – becomes much more burdensome, while the export stimulus from lower exchange rates will be small, owing to the absence of new capacity outside the commodity sectors.
As countries come under pressure to make payments, multiple emerging-market debt crises are likely.
In the short term, Brazil arouses the most worry, given its large public debt and its vast budget deficit.
In the medium term, however, China appears even more frightening.
As a rule of thumb, an emerging economy’s total private- and public-sector debt should not exceed 100% of GDP.
China’s total debt is now more than 250% of GDP.
The BRICS countries’ critical shortcoming is poor governance. On its corruption perception index of 175 countries, Transparency International ranks South Africa 61st, Brazil and India 76th, China 83rd, and Russia 119th.
Poor governance limits a country’s ability to create lasting wealth and productive capacity – even if the shortcomings become evident and damaging only when booms turn to busts.
As Warren Buffet has put it, “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.”
To combat corruption effectively, people need to oust corrupt leaders, which is why democracy is vital.
The regime changes in Ukraine and Argentina, and the opposition’s victory in Venezuela’s recent parliamentary election, are harbingers of what is to come.
Brazil may be next.
The emerging markets may rise again, if and when improved governance and structural reforms are implemented to boost potential growth.
But that will take time.
We should not be surprised to see two decades of slow global growth.
The West cannot afford to be complacent.
After having focused too much on demand management, Europe should be trying to reduce the fiscal and regulatory burden of the state, so that its economies can start growing again.
It should also open up stunted markets for labor, services, capital, and digital products.
The West needs to work together to set global standards while it still can.
Democracy, the rule of law, and market-based economies are all worth fighting for.
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and the wars in North Africa and the Middle East have demonstrated why NATO should be strengthened, and that Europe must become serious about defending itself – rather than simply continuing to depend on the United States.
In coordinating Western sanctions against Russia, the G7 has already achieved renewed significance.
This should be followed by efforts to manage the coming stagnation.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are both important initiatives in this regard.
Western-led organizations and institutional arrangements will become especially important as international organizations struggle to remain relevant. The United Nations, in particular, will likely be crippled by Russian and Chinese vetoes in the Security Council.
Only the International Monetary Fund can be expected to rise in prominence, as major emerging economies – most likely Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil – end up as its wards.
Economics aside, China and Russia are likely to pose the biggest challenge.
These two large emerging countries are still led by authoritarian governments, headed by ruling elites who – given how much wealth they have amassed – may be the most corrupt in history.
As they come under pressure, their transformations are unlikely to be peaceful.
The Kremlin has already shown, with its wars in Ukraine and Syria, that it is ready to counter domestic malaise with external aggression.
That is unlikely to change unless something is done to stop it.
The fall of the emerging economies could have a far more lasting impact than their rise.

The Two Best Ways to Reduce Infant Mortality
BANGKOK – One of the more ambitious targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the commitment to end preventable deaths of newborns and children over the next decade.
If this target is met, by 2030 no country will have a neonatal mortality rate above 12 deaths per 1,000 births – a quarter of the current rate in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Given the magnitude of the challenge, huge investments will be needed in health-care infrastructure and planning.
Perhaps the most effective way to reduce infant mortality would be to encourage uptake of two readily available resources: maternal vaccinations and breast milk.
Protecting children from early deaths begins before they are born.
When a woman is vaccinated against common illnesses like influenza, her body creates antibodies that recognize viruses and boost natural defenses against pathogens.
When she becomes pregnant, these protective proteins are transferred to her baby across the placenta.
Remarkably, the benefits continue after birth.
For example, while the flu shot is not approved for infants younger than six months old, clinical trials have shown that children born to mothers who have been vaccinated are better protected against the illness.
In one study of mothers and their babies in Bangladesh, researchers recorded a staggering 63% reduction in influenza cases among infants born to vaccinated mothers, a 36% reduction in the number of serious respiratory illnesses for mothers, and a 29% reduction in such illnesses among infants.
Maternal immunization against the flu also helps protect infants from pneumonia, a common cause of childhood mortality.
A 2018 analysis of flu-vaccine trials conducted in Nepal, Mali, and South Africa found that infants were 20% less likely to develop pneumonia if their mothers had been inoculated.
Children too young to be completely vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza were the biggest beneficiaries. Armed with data from these and other studies, governments in low-income countries should be able to plan smarter immunization campaigns and substantially lower rates of infant morbidity and mortality.
The second way to reduce childhood mortality, breastfeeding, arguably has a greater impact.
Breast milk is the perfect nutrition for a baby, providing all the proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that a young body needs to stay healthy.
Best of all, mothers create new antibodies in real time, which help strengthen young immune systems.
Unfortunately, rates of breastfeeding and breast-milk consumption are well below desired levels.
Only 40% of infants worldwide are breastfed exclusively until they are at least six months old, as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends.
The reasons are complex, but in many countries, lack of education, together with aggressive marketing by makers of baby formula, has contributed to a decline in breastfeeding. Recently, the United States has been accused of siding with the formula industry by opposing a WHO resolution in support of breastfeeding.
Convincing mothers to breastfeed should be easier.
For starters, breastfed babies are less likely to contract ear infections and meningitis, or to suffer gastrointestinal illnesses and diarrhea.
These advantages continue for as long as a baby is breastfed.
Mothers also benefit from breastfeeding.
Research shows that women who have breastfed during their lives are less likely to develop non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular illness, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Many of these gains derive from the fact that breastfeeding helps break down the extra fat that accumulates in a woman’s body during pregnancy.
In fact, producing milk for a single infant burns as much as 500 calories a day.
Even though the majority of new mothers are able to breastfeed, not all women can produce enough milk, owing to exhaustion, depression, or physical weakness following postpartum surgery.
Some mothers are simply unable to meet their child’s needs, while others lack the medical or social support to navigate the logistics of breastfeeding.
Nonetheless, for those who can supply their babies with at least six months of breast milk, the benefits are significant.
If the international community is serious about meeting the health targets set by the SDGs, it must redouble its efforts to encourage more mothers to be vaccinated against preventable illnesses and to feed their newborns breast milk.
These two practices alone could do more to reduce infant mortality than just about any other global health initiative.

Iran Versus Saudi Arabia
BERLIN – The “new” Middle East is now on daily display.
Unlike the old Middle East, whose fate was determined by the dominant Western powers (the United Kingdom and France after World War I, and the United States from the 1940s until recently), the new one has no external hegemon to stabilize it.
And, without a dominant regional power, a dangerous strategic vacuum has emerged.
The US, quite obviously, is no longer willing – or able – to play its old role.
Though America will not withdraw its armed forces from the region completely, direct military intervention, especially with ground troops, is not tenable, given the debacle in Iraq. America will not be a military player so long as the region’s strategic balance is not called into question in a fundamental way (which explains US airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria).
Apart from this, the US is now operating at the level of diplomacy to resolve, or at least contain, a fundamental strategic threat – the danger posed by the Iranian nuclear program.
Various state and non-state actors have been trying to fill the void created by America’s newfound caution, with most of the latter dependent on the support of regional powers, and two in particular: Iran and Saudi Arabia.
These countries’ struggle for regional supremacy is playing out on proxy battlefields in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and, now, Yemen.
Indeed, the Houthi rebellion in Yemen marks a new phase in the broader regional conflict. Not only is it occurring in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, directly on Saudi Arabia’s borders; the kingdom’s direct military intervention has brought its strategic rivalry with Iran into the open.
As always in the Middle East, religious and ethnic factors play a large role in this rivalry.
The Shia-Sunni divide within Islam is being reflected in the region’s geopolitics.
Moreover, whereas Iran is a Shia country, the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Sunni, reinforcing the salience of Iran’s ethnic distinctiveness.
Geopolitical interests, religious sectarianism, and ethnicity thus form a dangerous mélange in the new Middle East.
And, because history has shown that outside military intervention can neither solve nor even contain such conflicts, the regional powers will have to sort this out among themselves, which is far easier said than done. It will entail a long phase of largely unpredictable violence, which implies a high risk of escalation, even toward global conflict; and it will most likely result in humanitarian disasters on the order of what is happening in Syria today.
Even barring escalation beyond the Middle East, significant economic dangers are also likely, given the region’s energy reserves and thus its importance to the global economy.
World oil prices are de facto determined on the Arabian Peninsula and by the countries of the adjacent Gulf region, and this will not change anytime soon.
In terms of international security, a long-term fight for regional dominance will increase the threat of global terrorism, as both sides are using extremist groups that seek to legitimize their actions in religious terms.
An even greater danger is that the key players in this conflict seek to arm themselves with nuclear weapons.
A nuclear arms race in a region characterized by long-term instability would be a global nightmare.
So it is no accident that, concurrently with the regional powers’ direct military confrontation in Yemen, the international community, led by the US, has been trying to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran.
The framework agreement that has now resulted from these talks, which have been taking place off and on for 12 years (and in which I participated for a time) is intended to bring Iran’s nuclear program under international supervision, thereby containing the risk to regional and global stability.
In exchange, international economic sanctions on Iran are to be lifted.
America’s agenda is now arousing massive criticism from its close allies in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
But such criticism is based on illusionary aims.
Acceding to it would merely ensure further escalation of the conflict with Iran, which will never completely abandon its nuclear technology and nuclear activities.
The only realistic option to prevent a nuclear arms race in the region is international supervision – as far-reaching and as comprehensive as possible.
But this goal, even if achieved, would satisfy neither Israel nor Saudi Arabia, both of which fear that any agreement would support Iran in its effort to establish its regional dominance.
So the end result could be a de facto change of regional strategic partners by the US – a development that in fact is already becoming apparent in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq.
Iran’s strategy in all of this has not been very clever: its military interventions in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen entail major risks.
That became apparent with the recent formation of a pan-Arab military force, which is clearly directed against Iran and should give its leaders reason to rethink their policy.
The new Middle East needs neither a nuclear arms race nor religious hatred, and it also does not need a foreign policy based on military intervention. Rather, it requires the strength to sit down together and negotiate, and to develop systems of collective security that do serve the legitimate interests of all parties involved.
Without diplomacy and the willingness to work toward viable mutual understandings, as has just happened with the framework agreement negotiated with Iran, the new Middle East will remain the powder keg of world politics – one whose fuse has already been lit.

Achieving Earth for All
NEW DELHI – In 1972, the United Nations held its first-ever environmental summit in Stockholm. In the run-up to the event, a group of scientists wrote The Limits to Growth, a report for the Club of Rome that became an unlikely bestseller.
The authors argued that Earth’s finite natural resources could not support ever-increasing consumption, and warned of likely ecological overshoot and societal collapse if the world did not recognize the environmental costs of human activity.
Failure to change course would mean declines in per capita food and energy supplies, increasing pollution, lower standards of living, and the possibility of dramatic population collapses by the middle of the twenty-first century.
In the decades that followed, the report’s startling conclusions were probably more criticized than commended.
Many brushed them aside as a Doomsday scenario that human ingenuity and technological progress would render moot.
But The Limits to Growth did not provide a single forecast.
Rather, the authors explored several alternative paths based on different human strategies, and recent research by Gaya Herrington has shown that three of the four scenarios they outlined align quite closely with empirical data.
This is deeply worrying, because two of these three scenarios suggest a major collapse by mid-century while the third entails a smaller decline.
Herrington argues that “humanity is on a path to having limits to growth imposed on itself rather than consciously choosing its own.”
But all is not lost: The fourth scenario, which involved significant economic and social transformations, allows for widespread increases in human welfare within Earth’s natural boundaries.
This is the motivation behind Earth for All, a new report produced by the Club of Rome’s Transformational Economics Commission (of which I am a member) and a team of computer modelers.
The report’s authors argue that achieving well-being for all on a (relatively) stable planet is still possible, but will require major changes in economic organization.
In particular, it calls for five major initiatives to eliminate poverty, reduce inequality, empower women, transform food systems, and overhaul energy systems by “electrifying everything.”
To flesh out these aspirations, the report advocates specific and interlinked strategies for achieving each one.
Of course, this will require significant new investments, led by massive increases in public spending.
Higher taxation, especially of the extremely wealthy and of large firms, must therefore be an important part of the agenda.
Restricting the wealth and consumption of the super-rich is also important for limiting carbon dioxide emissions and unnecessarily wasteful consumption.
In addition, creating global liquidity (such as by issuing more special drawing rights, the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset) and dealing with the sovereign-debt overhang would give developing-country governments more fiscal space.
Global food systems are clearly broken.
They currently create unhealthy and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, as well as enormous waste, and must be upgraded accordingly.
Regulation of markets for the public good will be critical in this process.
More systematic and effective regulation is necessary not only with respect to food, but also in markets for goods and services, finance, labor, and land, and to those connected to nature and the environment.
The regulation we need demands democratization of knowledge and wider access to new technologies, as well as recognition and dissemination of traditional knowledge.
Giving women and workers more power is essential, not only for making societies happier, healthier, and more just, but also for stabilizing population numbers.
Furthermore, the Earth for All report contains the results of a global modeling exercise that focuses specifically on two scenarios.
The first, “Too Little Too Late,” is our current trajectory, in which governments and international institutions talk a lot about sustainability and climate change, but produce little transformative action.
This scenario points to growing inequalities and declining social trust, as people and countries turn against one another in competing for resources.
Without sufficient collective action to limit the immense pressure on nature, Earth’s life-supporting systems (such as climate, water, soil, and forests) will keep deteriorating, and some regions will come close to or even cross irreversible tipping points.
For many people already living in poverty and for many other species, what is effectively hell on Earth awaits.
But in the second scenario – “The Giant Leap” – policymakers seek to implement the five major shifts and do a much better job of increasing well-being.
That means ensuring dignity (so that everyone has the means to live in security, health, and safety); nature (a restored and safe environment for all forms of life); and connection (a sense of belonging and institutions that serve the common good). It also means ensuring fairness (providing justice in all its dimensions, with much-reduced gaps between richest and poorest) and participation (actively engaged citizens in rooted communities and economies).
Achieving all this will not be easy, of course.
Widespread, sustainable gains in well-being necessarily require active governments that are willing to reshape markets and pursue long-term visions for societies. This in turn requires both political will and a sea change in governments’ perceptions – and the latter is unlikely without significant public pressure and mass mobilization.
But, given our proximity to so many tipping points, the default option is terrifying: environmental devastation, extreme economic disparities and fragilities, and potentially unbearable social and political tensions.
So, Earth for All is not just a report – it is a call to action.
Because the necessary changes are so big, they require determined social movements with broad participation.
History shows that inertia and defeatism can become self-fulfilling.
But it also shows that governments ultimately must respond to popular pressure or be replaced by it.

China’s Monetary Sterilization
BEIJING – Not long after the United States Federal Reserve Board announced its second round of “quantitative easing” (known as QE2), the People’s Bank of China (PBC), China’s central bank, announced two increases of 0.5 percentage points in the required reserve ratio (RRR) of bank deposits.
The RRR now stands at 18.5%, a historic high, even in global terms.
While the Fed is planning to pump more money into the US economy, the PBC is trying to reduce the amount of money in circulation in China.
Money used by commercial banks to satisfy the RRR, which is held in accounts at the PBC, can no longer be extended as loans.
As a result, more money than ever is now frozen or inactive in China.
It is understandable that the Fed wants to boost demand as long as the US economy remains depressed.
But why has the PBC tightened monetary policy so much?
The Chinese economy is not over-heating.
Growth is still high, at about 10% per year, but has started to moderate.
And, while inflation is a concern – having risen to 4.4% year on year in October, from 3.6% in September – this cannot explain why the PBC raised the RRR three times earlier this year, when inflation was lower.
Instead, the PBC’s policy is preemptive: sterilize over-liquidity and get the money supply under control in order to prevent inflation or over-heating.
At the beginning of the year, the RRR increases could be regarded as part of efforts to correct the over-supply of money that arose from the anti-crisis stimulus package.
But the most recent RRR increases serve mainly to sterilize the “passive money supply” caused by the increase in foreign-exchange reserves.
Indeed, in September alone, China’s foreign-currency reserves increased by almost $100 billion compared to August.
With the global economy recovering, China’s trade surplus began to grow.
Moreover, capital inflows increased significantly, owing to real investment opportunities in the high-growth economy and the expectation of renminbi revaluation.
But rapid growth in foreign-exchange reserves means an increase in the domestic money supply, because the PBC issues RMB6.64 (down 3% since June) for every dollar it receives. That means that money supply increase by nearly RMB700 billion in September.
The two 50-basis-point RRR increases just locked up the same amount of liquidity.
A country with current-account and capital-account surpluses and increasing foreign-exchange reserves normally sees an excessive money supply and high inflation.
But, while excessive money supply is a reality for China – the PBC now holds more than $2.6 trillion in foreign reserves – inflation has been quite moderate so far, thanks to the sterilization policy.
The RRR is only one example of a textbook sterilization instrument.
Another is to sell off government bonds held by the central bank in order to take money out of circulation – again, just the opposite of what the Fed is now doing.
Because China’s government does not owe much debt to the public, the PBC sold out its holdings of government bonds in 2005.
So it had to create something else to sell.
It created so-called “Central Bank Bills,” which commercial banks are supposed to buy voluntarily.
When they do, the money they pay is also locked up in the PBC’s accounts.
To date, up to 5-6% of total liquidity has been returned to the central bank in this way.
Furthermore, the PBC uses unconventional instruments from time to time, such as “credit ceilings” or “credit quotas” imposed on commercial banks.
This may result in “extra reserves,” which commercial banks cannot use to extend their credit lines.
Credit quotas imposed early this year have left Chinese commercial banks with 2-3% of extra reserves.
Adding up the impact of the PBC’s sterilization efforts, roughly one-quarter of China’s total monetary base is illiquid.
Thus, although China’s total money supply seems excessive, with the M2-to-GDP ratio now at about 190%, the real monetary base is actually much smaller than it appears.
As a result, China’s inflation, as well as asset prices, remain under control.
For how long will this sterilization continue, and how far will it go?
At what point will higher RRR levels cause Chinese commercial banks to begin running losses?
There may be room for further sterilization.
First, unlike in some other countries, Chinese commercial banks are paid reasonable interest rates on required reserves, except for the “extra reserves” that they hold.
So they do not lose much, if anything, from the PBC’s sterilization policies.
Second, China’s central bank still controls interest rates by enforcing a roughly three-percentage-point spread between deposit rates and lending rates.
As a result, Chinese commercial banks can operate longer with a higher RRR than their counterparts elsewhere.
One key issue facing China is how to reduce the current- and capital-account surpluses in order to reduce foreign-exchange holdings.
Yes, further revaluation of the exchange rate is needed, but this can play only a secondary role.
The most important task for China is to reduce the saving rate, which equaled 52% of GDP in 2009.
A number of fiscal, social-security, and tax reforms should be a priority for this purpose.
But it seems that both revaluation and reform will take time.
Meanwhile, the causes of global imbalance on the US side also seem unlikely to disappear any time soon.
And now, with the Fed’s QE2 on the table, conditions may worsen before they improve.
The PBC may have to continue its sterilization for some time in the foreseeable future.

India with 1.5 Billion People
India's population is now a little over one billion; it will almost certainly surpass 1.5 billion by mid-century, overtaking China's population along the way before it stops growing.
But, as worrying as this might appear, this actually represents a considerable demographic slowdown: India's population more than tripled during the past sixty years.
Moreover, the economy is growing much faster than before. So will India be able to provide a comfortable home for 1.5 billion people?
I recently co-authored a study (with Tim Dyson, Leela Visaria and others) that concludes, with modest optimism, that while India can manage its population growth, it also faces a number of major difficulties.
True, poverty fell in the 1990's, while literacy rates and school attendance rose. But they did so unevenly.
Most of India's big poor states - Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh - suffer from a combination of relatively slow economic growth and rapid demographic growth.
Only Rajasthan's economy has kept pace with the rest of the country; the other four have not benefited much from trade and regulatory liberalization.
Similarly, states where birth rates fell earlier, such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, are already enjoying shrinking school-age populations, whereas school-age numbers in Bihar will still be rising until around 2025.
But the majority of children in Kerala and Tamil Nadu are already in school, while in Bihar they are not.
These five poor states contain 45% of India's population, and 56% of its poor.
Our projections indicate that in 20 years they will account for more than half the population and 75% of the poor.
Unless recent trends can be reversed, the growing economic and demographic gulf between India's North and East and its South and West will pose a serious political threat.
The environmental impact of 1.5 billion inhabitants forms the other major challenge. India's past population growth has been accompanied - if much too slowly and unequally - by improving health, education, and economic welfare.
But the environment has been suffering.
Our study concludes that India can have faster economic and industrial growth, higher rates of energy consumption, and a cleaner environment.
But this is not what has happened so far.
Air, soil, and water pollution has been growing, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths every year.
The key to a clean future is clean technologies, whose costs have been falling steadily, and will continue to do so.
Sometimes these technologies pay for themselves and will be adopted.
But Indian producers and transporters will not invest in them if they bear the costs, while the public at large receives the benefits.
In these cases, government will have to provide incentives, or regulate and tax.
Unfortunately, however, when the main beneficiaries are the poor, corporations are powerful, and governments are weak or corrupt, good environmental practices are far from guaranteed.
There are nonetheless some notable success stories.
Delhi's barely breathable air has become tolerable, following a big move to compressed natural gas in public transport, retirement of old vehicles, and higher emissions standards in new ones.
Delhi's cleaner air hasn't cost much, yet other cities have been slow to follow suit.
The biggest problem is water pollution, with discharges into canals and rivers growing faster than treatment capacity.
At the same time, India's growing population will make increasing demands on water supplies - mainly for agriculture, which absorbs more than 80% of all the fresh water India consumes.
If the population grows by 50%, the country will need to grow 50% more food, if it is to continue to feed itself.
But there won't be any more water.
In fact, there could well be less water than there is now, owing to pollution and climate change.
So India will need huge increases in water efficiency.
Here, too, there are examples of improvement.
But there is also far too much populist politicking, with promises of free water for farmers. Doing what has to be done to ensure sustainable water supplies - controlling pollution, encouraging conservation, regulating and charging where necessary - is politically tough.
Eventually, however, India has no choice: there are already sporadic riots over water shortage, while water tankers move under armed guard in some cities, and virulent conflicts arise between communities over water-sharing.
In questionnaires, the poor say that an adequate water supply is their foremost need.
But one fears that something more dreadful than the daily misery must occur before India's politicians decide to act.
Our study quotes three national water surveys. Each concludes that India can have a satisfactory water future.
As with the other challenges posed by population growth, the issue is not whether the future can be managed, but whether it will be.
India may or may not be the world's next economic wonder; but it will have to solve its age-old problems, as well as its new ones, if it is going to be a good place to live for the vast majority of its citizens.

The Case for Secret Diplomacy
CAMBRIDGE – When New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez announced that he will oppose Mike Pompeo’s nomination to US Secretary of State, he explained that he would do so because Pompeo, currently Director of the CIA, had failed to disclose that he had traveled to North Korea over Easter weekend as President Donald Trump’s envoy.
For Menendez, the audacity and secrecy of the Trump administration’s preparations for a planned summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was unacceptable.
“Now I don’t expect diplomacy to be negotiated out in the open,” Menendez said in a recent speech, “but I do expect for someone who is the nominee to be Secretary of State, when he speaks with committee leadership and is asked specific questions about North Korea, to share some insights about such a visit.
I believe our nation’s top diplomat must be forthright.”
The US constitution assigns senators the responsibility to confirm, by majority vote, the president’s cabinet nominees.
America’s founders sought to ensure that individuals serving in high positions of public trust would be well qualified, not just in the judgment of a single individual, but after thoughtful review by an independently elected Senate.
In exercising their constitutional duty, senators should consider carefully their criteria for providing what the constitution calls “advice and consent.”
There are many good reasons why senators may decide to support or oppose Pompeo’s nomination.
But Pompeo’s withholding of the fact that he was engaged in secret diplomacy is not one of them.
To be sure, despite being a mainstay of US foreign policy, secret diplomacy has always had its critics.
Some argue that it is a type of deception that undermines the transparency and accountability on which American democracy is based.
Others do not oppose secret diplomacy per se, but they believe that maintaining a reasonable degree of democratic accountability requires that a small subset of congressional leaders be informed.
In criticizing Pompeo for failing to be “forthright” even with the “committee leadership,” Menendez expressed both of these concerns.
Yet the history of secret diplomacy, under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, clearly illustrates its benefits.
The most important diplomatic breakthrough of the Cold War, the opening to China, began with secret negotiations between Henry Kissinger, then President Richard Nixon’s national security adviser, and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.
Kissinger’s top-secret trip to Beijing in 1971 laid the groundwork for Nixon’s historic visit the following year. And the warming of Sino-US relations helped widen divisions between China and America’s Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union.
Likewise, President Barack Obama’s signature diplomatic achievement, the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, could not have been achieved without secret talks.
In March 2013, Obama sent two senior State Department officials, William J. Burns and Jake Sullivan, to begin secret conversations with the Iranians in Oman.
Given that diplomatic relations between the two countries had been severed for more than 30 years, and that each country was radioactive in the domestic politics of the other, holding preliminary negotiations in public would have been a non-starter.
Soon enough, the secret conversations led US officials to conclude that the Iranians were serious about entering into formal talks.
In secret, US and Iranian negotiators worked on an outline of what would ultimately become the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
The JCPOA blocked all of Iran’s major pathways to becoming a nuclear power, by preventing the country from reprocessing plutonium or enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels.
It also eliminated two-thirds of Iran’s centrifuges and 98% of its stockpile of enriched uranium; and it established the most intrusive verification and inspection regime ever negotiated.
But as difficult as the talks with Iran were, negotiating with Kim’s Hermit Kingdom will be harder still.
The United States and North Korea are technically still at war, because a formal peace treaty has not been concluded since the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended with a ceasefire and an armistice.
Moreover, every past denuclearization agreement between the two countries has collapsed, and, since Trump took office, he and Kim have been lobbing insults and threats at each other.
In this context, sending a secret envoy to Pyongyang to lay the groundwork for productive negotiations is precisely what the US should be doing.
Even so, there is still the question of why that envoy would not inform Senate foreign-policy leaders of his work, especially when he is seeking to become America’s chief diplomat. One answer is that the Trump administration probably believes that informing Congress would make the secret negotiations no longer a secret.
During the past year’s investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ahead of the 2016 US presidential election, Congress has leaked like a sieve, and many congressional Democrats have made it clear that they will “resist” Trump at every turn.
Thus, it was reasonable for Pompeo to fear that knowledge of his secret talks would be leaked in an effort to undermine the summit and deny the administration a potential political victory.
Transparency and accountability are still important American norms.
But the history of US diplomacy has shown that secrecy often is essential for success. And besides, the constitution gives the president wide latitude in foreign policy.
That is why even some of Menendez’s Democratic colleagues, who may oppose Pompeo on policy grounds, cheered the news of his visit to North Korea.
As Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy put it, “I’ll just be honest with you, I’m glad there is someone at a high level in the Trump administration talking to the North Koreans about what may be the parameters of this meeting.”
Murphy is right.
There are valid reasons to oppose a nominee for Secretary of State.
But a failure to disclose secret preparatory talks for the most important presidential summit of the century is not one of them.

Reclaiming Community
CAMBRIDGE – Economics teaches that the measure of an individual’s wellbeing is the quantity and variety of goods he or she can consume.
Consumption possibilities are in turn maximized by providing firms with the freedom they need to take advantage of new technologies, the division of labor, economies of scale, and mobility.
Consumption is the goal; production is the means to it.
Markets, rather than communities, are the unit and object of analysis.
No one can deny that this consumer- and market-centric vision of the economy has produced plenty of fruit.
The dazzling array of consumer goods available in the megastores or Apple outlets of any major city in the world would have been unimaginable as recently as a generation ago.
But clearly something has gone wrong in the meantime.
The economic and social divisions within our societies have provoked a broad backlash in a wide range of settings – from the United States, Italy, and Germany in the developed world to developing countries such as the Philippines and Brazil.
This political turmoil suggests that economists’ priorities may not have been entirely appropriate.
Two books, one forthcoming from Raghuram Rajan and another published this month by Oren Cass, revisit our economistic worldview and argue that we should instead put the health of our local communities front and center.
Stable families, good jobs, strong schools, abundant and safe public spaces, and pride in local cultures and history – these are the essential elements of prosperous societies. Neither global markets nor the nation-state can adequately supply them, and sometimes markets and states undermine them.
The authors come from different vantage points.
Rajan is an economist at the University of Chicago and a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India.
Cass is at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and was domestic policy director for Republican Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.
You would not necessarily expect either a Chicago economist or a moderate Republican to treat markets and hyper-globalization with skepticism.
But both are disturbed by what they see as the effects on communities.
Rajan calls community the “third pillar” of prosperity, as important as the other two pillars – the state and market.
No less than excessive centralized state power, he writes, unmanaged globalization can tear apart the fabric of local communities.
Cass is explicit that US trade and immigration policy should focus on American workers first and foremost.
This means ensuring that local labor markets are healthy and that there are plenty of goods jobs at decent wages.
Both authors emphasize the gains from trade and reject US President Donald Trump’s protectionism.
But they agree we may have gone too far into hyper-globalization and paid insufficient attention to the costs for communities.
When a local factory closes because a firm has decided to outsource to a supplier across the border, more is lost than the hundreds (or thousands) of jobs that move abroad.
The impact is multiplied through reduced spending on local goods and services, which means workers and employers across the entire local economy feel the hit.
The local government’s tax revenues fall as well, so there is less money to spend on education and other public amenities. Anomie, family breakdown, opioid addiction, and other social ills often follow.
Economists’ usual answer is to call for “greater labor market flexibility”: workers should simply leave depressed areas and seek jobs elsewhere.
But as Cass reminds us, geographical mobility has to be coupled with “the opportunity to stay.”
Even during times of significant migration, the bulk of local populations stayed put and needed good jobs and solid communities.
Alternatively, economists might recommend compensating the losers from economic change, through social transfers and other benefits.
Leaving aside the feasibility of such transfers, it is doubtful that they are the solution.
Joblessness will undermine individual and community wellbeing even if consumption levels are propped up through cash grants.
Ultimately, it is only through the creation and expansion of well-paying jobs that local communities can be made vital.
Cass’s proposal is to encourage employment through wage subsidies.
Rajan emphasizes the role of local leaders who can mobilize community assets, generate social engagement on the part of local residents, and create a new image – all in the context of more supportive state policies and managed globalization.
Other economists have advocated regionally targeted manufacturing extension programs, fostering partnerships between local employers and universities.
Yet others recommend local public spending, such as on job training programs for small and medium-sized enterprises.
We do not have a good fix on what works best, and a fair amount of policy experimentation will be needed to make progress.
But the urgency of action is heightened by the fact that ongoing technological trends threaten to exacerbate communities’ existing problems.
New digital technologies tend to exhibit scale economies and network effects, which produce concentration rather than localization of production.
Instead of diffusing gains, they create winner-take-all markets.
The globalization of production networks magnifies such effects further.
How we balance these forces with the needs of communities will shape not only our economic fortunes, but also our social and political environment.
As Cass and Rajan show, it is a problem that economists should no longer ignore.

A Strategic Compass for Europe
BRUSSELS – A compass helps one find one’s way, and the “Strategic Compass” that I have drafted at the behest of the European Council will serve as an operational guide for the European Union’s development and decision-making on security and defense.
It is now heading to EU foreign affairs and defense ministers for discussions next week.
The compass is designed to answer three questions: Which challenges and threats do we face?
How can we better pool our assets and manage them effectively?
And what is the best way to project Europe’s influence as both a regional and global actor?
Our overall threat analysis shows clearly that Europe is in danger.
The EU risks what I have called a “strategic shrinkage.”
This can be perceived from three points of view.
First, our economic reach is becoming increasingly circumscribed.
Thirty years ago, the EU represented one-quarter of the world’s wealth; in 20 years, it will account for just over 10%.
Our demographic shrinkage develops similarly: By the end of this century, Europe will account for less than 5% of the world’s population.
More fundamentally, some of our economic competitors hold values that are very different from ours, thus posing a threat to our normative power.
The EU must integrate this fact into its policymaking, recognizing that the competition for global standards is already playing out in the race for mastery over artificial intelligence, cloud computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology.
Second, the EU’s strategic theater is increasingly contested, owing to challenges by new ambitious actors, demonstrations of military force, and destabilization strategies featuring cyber warfare and disinformation.
Gone are the days when peace and war constituted two clearly distinct states.
We are and will increasingly be confronted with hybrid situations that require a broad range of defensive assets.
Finally, the EU’s political sphere is being squeezed, and our liberal values increasingly contested.
In the “battle of narratives,” the idea that universal values are really just Western constructs has been gaining traction.
The old assumption that economic prosperity would always lead to democratic development has been refuted.
In navigating this increasingly competitive strategic environment, the EU must become a provider of security for its citizens, protecting our values and interests.
But to do that, it will need to act faster and more decisively when managing crises.
That means anticipating fast-changing threats and safeguarding its citizens against them; investing in the necessary capabilities and technologies; and cooperating with partners to achieve common goals.
Such measures will increase our capacity to deter attacks, and to react to one if it comes.
The main value of military force is not that it allows us to solve problems, but that it can help to prevent problems being solved to our detriment.
That is why the Strategic Compass proposes an EU capacity for rapid force deployment across the entire spectrum of actions envisaged by EU treaties.
Past attempts to deploy EU forces swiftly have met with only limited success.
But the Strategic Compass aims to make such deployments more readily operational and effective in three ways.
First, it would follow a modular approach, with its composition defined by concrete scenarios and reinforced by joint training, rather than being pre-positioned as a permanent force.
Second, there would be clear guidelines stating that it is the mission that determines the type and size of the force, not vice versa.
And, third, we could step up our efforts to overcome various shortcomings that have long hampered our operational capabilities, with clear actions that should receive priority.
All of this will require both legitimacy and flexibility.
Who decides, and how should decisions be implemented?
Without calling into question the principle of unanimity, it is possible to act creatively by activating certain provisions such as constructive abstention or Article 44, which allows for the creation of coalitions approved by the European Council.
Above all, we need political will (without which nothing is possible) and operational efficiency (without which everything is pointless).
But the EU should of course not limit its actions to the deployment of military forces. The Strategic Compass also focuses on cyber, maritime, and space security.
To anticipate threats, it proposes boosting intelligence capacities and expanding the suite of tools for countering hybrid and cyberattacks as well as foreign disinformation and interference.
It also sets targets for investment to equip our armed forces with the necessary capabilities and innovative technologies, to fill strategic gaps, and to reduce technological and industrial dependencies.
Finally, let me emphasize that this effort in no way contradicts Europe’s commitment to NATO, which remains at the heart of our territorial defense.
This commitment should not prevent us from developing our own capabilities and conducting independent operations in our neighborhood and beyond, especially at a time when US policymakers’ attention may be focused elsewhere (not least on the Indo-Pacific).
European strategic responsibility is the best way to reinforce transatlantic solidarity. This concept is at the heart of the new dialogue on security and defense between the United States and the EU.
But all Europeans should understand that the Strategic Compass is not a magic wand.
It is for the EU member states to determine whether today’s geopolitical shifts will be yet another unheeded wake-up call, and the renewed debate on European defense yet another false start.
The Strategic Compass is an opportunity to meet Europe’s security responsibilities directly, in front of our citizens and the rest of the world.

Is Global Financial Reform Possible?
HONG KONG – Nowadays there is ample evidence that financial systems, whether in Asia in the 1990’s or a decade later in the United States and Europe, are vulnerable to breakdowns.
The cost in interrupted growth and unemployment has been intolerably large.
But, in the absence of international consensus on some key points, reform will be greatly weakened, if not aborted.
The freedom of money, financial markets, and people to move – and thus to escape regulation and taxation – might be an acceptable, even constructive, brake on excessive official intervention, but not if a deregulatory race to the bottom prevents adoption of needed ethical and prudential standards.
Perhaps most important is a coherent, consistent approach to dealing with the imminent failure of “systemically important” institutions.
Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure – even as bailouts encourage excessive risk taking.
By law in the US, new approaches superseding established bankruptcy procedures dictate the demise rather than the rescue of failing firms, whether by sale, merger, or liquidation.
But such efforts’ success will depend on complementary approaches elsewhere, most importantly in the United Kingdom and other key financial centers.
Strict uniformity of regulatory practices may not be necessary.
For example, the UK and the US may be adopting approaches that differ with respect to protecting commercial banks from more speculative, proprietary trading, but the policy concerns are broadly similar – and may not be so pressing elsewhere, where banking traditions are different and trading is more restrained.
But other jurisdictions should not act to undercut the restrictions imposed by home authorities.
Closely related to these reforms is reform of the international monetary system.
Indeed, one might legitimately question whether we have a “system” at all, at least compared to the Bretton Woods arrangements and, before that, the seeming simplicity of the gold standard.
No one today has been able to exert authority systematically and consistently, and there is no officially sanctified and controlled international currency.
Arguably, the ideal of a well-defined and effective international monetary regime has become more difficult to realize as markets and capital flows have become vastly larger and more capricious.
Indeed, the global economy, it is said, has grown – and emerging countries have flourished – without a more organized system.
But what is too often overlooked is that international monetary disorder lay at the root of the successive financial crises of the 1990’s, and played an even more striking role in the crisis that erupted in 2008.
The sustained and, in a sense, complementary imbalances in the US and Asia stand out.
From 2000 to 2007, the US ran a cumulative current-account deficit of roughly $5.5 trillion, with nearly symmetrical offsetting increases in reserves in China and Japan.
China found it useful to run a large trade surplus, using a very high rate of internal savings and inward foreign investment to support its industrialization and rapid growth.
By contrast, the US, in the face of slow growth, was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings, inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang.
The practical and inescapable lesson is that when any country is left to its own policy devices, its preferences may lead to prolonged and ultimately unsustainable imbalances.
Sooner or later, adjustment will be necessary – if not by considered domestic policy or a well-functioning international monetary system, then by financial crisis.
Not so long ago, we were comforted by theorizing that floating exchange rates would mediate international adjustments in a timely and orderly way.
But, in the real world, many countries, particularly but not limited to small, open economies, simply find it impractical or undesirable to permit their currency to float.
We are left with the certainty, however awkward, that active participation in an open world economy requires some surrender of economic sovereignty.
Or, to put the point more positively, it requires a willingness to coordinate policies more effectively.
The possibilities include:
· Stronger surveillance by the International Monetary Fund and a firmer commitment by countries to abide by “best practices” and agreed norms.
· Direct and public recommendations by the IMF, the G-20, or others, following mandatory consultation.
· Qualification or disqualification with respect to the use of IMF or other credit facilities (for example, central banks’ swap lines).
· Interest or other financial penalties or incentives along the lines under consideration in Europe.
But, if approaches that build on past failure do not seem sufficiently effective, perhaps a new approach toward currency fluctuations would be more promising.
That would require some agreement about appropriate “equilibrium” exchange rates, with a fairly wide band that would allow for uncertainty and permit the market to exert its own discipline. But individual countries would orient intervention and economic policies toward defending the equilibrium rate, or, more radically, an international authority might authorize aggressive intervention by trading partners to promote consistency.
An appropriate reserve currency and adequate international liquidity represent another central concern.
For years, the pragmatic answer has been the dollar, and to some extent other national currencies, giving rise to complaints of an “inordinate privilege” for the US.
But it is not in America’s interest to accentuate and extend its payment deficits at the expense of an internationally competitive economy with strong industry and restrained consumption.
And the rest of the world wants the flexibility afforded by the currency of the largest, strongest, and most stable economy.
A useful reserve currency must be limited in supply, but have sufficient elasticity to satisfy the large, unpredictable needs that may arise in a turbulent financial world.
Above all, confidence in its stability and availability must be maintained, which highlights the practicality of a national currency, or perhaps a variety of national currencies.

The Public’s Business
CAMBRIDGE – Fifty years ago, Milton Friedman published an article in the New York Times that articulated what has come to be known as the Friedman doctrine: “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.”
It was a theme he had developed in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, where he argued that the “one and only” responsibility business owes to society is the pursuit of profits within the legal rules of the game.
The Friedman doctrine put its stamp on our era.
It legitimized the freewheeling capitalism that produced economic insecurity, fueled rising inequality, deepened regional divides, and intensified climate change and other environmental problems.
Ultimately, it also led to a social and political backlash.
Many large businesses have responded by engaging in – or paying lip service to – the notion of corporate social responsibility.
That notion is reflected in another anniversary this year.
The United Nations’ Global Compact, launched 20 years ago, takes direct aim at the Friedman doctrine by trying to persuade businesses to become agents for the broader social good.
More than 11,000 companies operating in 156 countries have signed on, making commitments in the areas of human rights, labor and environmental standards, and anti-corruption.
John Ruggie, the scholar who played a key role developing and managing the Global Compact, describes it and similar initiatives as transnational efforts that help firms develop social identities.
By promoting behavioral norms, such initiatives enable firms to self-regulate.
As such, Ruggie argues, they fill the vacuum created by the decline of traditional forms of regulation by national governments and international public organizations, making them an important tool for the rebalancing of market and society that we need.
Leading business professors, such as Rebecca Henderson of Harvard and Zeynep Ton of MIT, have been making the case that it is in corporate leaders’ long-term interest to take care of the environment or their workers. A year ago, the US Business Roundtable joined the bandwagon with a revised statement of corporate purpose, committing to deliver value not just to shareholders, but to “all stakeholders,” including employees, customers, suppliers, and communities.
The statement was signed by CEOs of nearly 200 major companies with a combined market capitalization exceeding $13 trillion.
And yet, despite the groundswell of private-sector support for corporate social responsibility, the effectiveness of relying on companies’ enlightened self-interest remains unclear.
A recent analysis by Harvard Law School’s Lucian Bebchuk and Roberto Tallarita provides a sobering counterpoint.
Bebchuk and Tallarita conclude that initiatives such as that by the Business Roundtable are “largely a rhetorical public relations move”: they are not reflected in actual corporate governance practices and do not engage with the difficult trade-offs that would be required if stakeholder interests were taken on board.
Moreover, such initiatives could backfire by “raising illusory hopes around the positive effects for stakeholders.”
So, government policies that regulate how businesses deal with their workers, local communities, and the environment remain of fundamental importance.
Proponents of stakeholder capitalism do not necessarily downplay governments’ role.
Some, such as Henderson, would argue that socially responsible business makes it easier for governments to do their proper job.
In other words, government regulation and corporate stakeholderism are complements, not substitutes, as Bebchuck and Tallarita believe.
But what if corporations are so powerful that they design the regulations themselves? The Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf recently wrote: “I used to think Milton Friedman was right.
But I have changed my mind.”
The flaw in the Friedman doctrine, Wolf explained, is that the rules of the game according to which corporations would pursue their profits are shaped not democratically, but by the “dominant influence” of money.
The rules are corrupted by corporations’ subversion of the political process through financial contributions.
But taking money out of politics, as Wolf recommends, would not solve the problem entirely. The reason is that so-called epistemic capture is as important as financial capture.
Regulation and policymaking require detailed knowledge of the circumstances facing firms, the available possibilities, and how these possibilities are likely to evolve.
In environmental regulation, finance, consumer safety, antitrust, or trade policy, government officials have ceded control to corporations because it is corporations that determine how knowledge is produced and disseminated.
This gives them the power to determine how problems are defined, which solutions are considered, what the technology envelope looks like.
In such circumstances, it is difficult for governments to set socially desirable ground rules without significant input, and hence influence from firms.
This calls for a different mode of regulatory governance, according to which broad economic, social, and environmental objectives are set by public authorities, but refined (and occasionally revised) in a continuous process of iterative collaboration with firms. While getting the private-public balance right is difficult, there are successful examples of such collaboration in technology promotion, food safety, and water-quality regulation.
Ultimately, though, the only real solution to the conundrum is to make business itself more democratic.
That means giving employees and local communities a direct say in the way firms are governed.
Firms can become a reliable partner for the social good only when they speak with the voices of those whose lives they shape.

A Scramble for Asia?
NEW DELHI – Asia’s festering Cold War-era territorial and maritime disputes highlight the fact that securing long-term region-wide peace depends on respect for existing borders.
Attempts to disturb Asia’s territorial status quo are an invitation to endemic conflict – a concern that led Asian states to welcome the US and Russia to their annual East Asian Summit.
The recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic spat over disputed islands in the East China Sea – followed, almost instantly, by a Sino-Vietnamese row over similar atolls – has put the spotlight on China and its regional policy. Governments across Asia are concerned that China’s rapidly accumulating power is emboldening it to assert territorial and maritime claims against neighbors stretching from Japan to India.
Even against tiny Bhutan, China has stepped up its lands claims through military incursions.
China’s new stridency underscores Asia’s central diplomatic challenge: coming to terms with existing boundaries by shedding the baggage of history that burdens all of the region’s important inter-state relationships.
Even as Asia is becoming more interdependent economically, it is becoming more politically divided.
A number of inter-state wars were fought in Asia since 1950, the year that both the Korean War and the annexation of Tibet started.
But, whereas the Europe’s bloody wars in the first half of the twentieth century have made war there unthinkable today, the wars in Asia in the second half of the twentieth century, far from settling or ending disputes, only accentuated bitter rivalries.
China, significantly, has been involved in the largest number of military conflicts in Asia.
A recent Pentagon report is unsparing: “The history of modern Chinese warfare provides numerous case studies in which China’s leaders have claimed military preemption as a strategically defensive act.
For example, China refers to its intervention in the Korean War (1950-1953) as the ‘War to Resist the United States and Aid Korea.’
Similarly, authoritative texts refer to border conflicts against India (1962), the Soviet Union (1969), and Vietnam (1979) as ‘Self-Defense Counter Attacks.’”
The seizure of the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974 by Chinese forces was another example of offense as defense.
All these cases of preemption occurred when China was weak, poor, and internally torn.
So the growing power of today’s China naturally raises legitimate concerns.
Having earlier preached the gospel of its “peaceful rise,” China no longer is shy about showcasing its military capabilities and asserting itself on multiple fronts.
With the Chinese Communist Party increasingly dependent on the military to maintain its monopoly on power and ensure domestic order, senior military officers are overtly influencing foreign policy.
The result is a growing territorial assertiveness, which has become a source of new friction along China’s land and sea frontiers.
That, in turn, has put China at the center of Asia’s political divides.
Several developments this year underscore China’s more muscular foreign policy, from its inclusion of the South China Sea in its “core” national interests – a move that makes its claims to the disputed Spratly Islands non-negotiable – to its reference to the Yellow Sea as a sort of exclusive Chinese military-operations zone.
The US and South Korea should, according to Chinese officials, discontinue holding joint naval exercises there, apparently out of respect for China’s new power.
China also has become more insistent in pressing its territorial claims both to India’s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state and to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, with Chinese warships making more frequent forays into Japanese waters.
Indian defense officials have reported a sharp increase in Chinese military incursions across the disputed 4,057-kilometer Himalayan frontier and in aggressive patrolling.
China also has started questioning Indian sovereignty over the state of Jammu and Kashmir, one-fifth of which it occupied following the Tibet annexation.
Beijing’s 2004 spat with South Korea over the ancient kingdom of Koguryo – triggered by a revised historical claim posted on the Chinese foreign ministry’s Web site that the empire, founded in the Tongge river basin of northern Korea, was Chinese – was seen as an attempt to hedge China’s options vis-à-vis a potentially unified Korea.
By signaling that the present China-North Korea border may not be final, Beijing has raised the specter of potential tensions over frontiers in the future.
Against that background, China’s increasingly assertive territorial and maritime claims threaten Asian peace and stability.
In fact, the largest real estate China covets is not in the South or East China Seas: India’s Arunachal Pradesh is almost three times larger than Taiwan.
Respect for boundaries is a prerequisite to peace and stability on any continent.
Europe has built its peace on that principle, with a number of European states learning to live with boundaries that they don’t like.
But the Chinese Communist Party still harps on old grievances to reinforce its claim to legitimacy: full restoration of China’s “dignity” after a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.
Through its overt refusal to accept Asia’s territorial status quo, China only highlights the futility of political negotiations.
After all, frontiers are never significantly redrawn at the negotiating table, but only on the battlefield, as China has shown in the past.
Today, whether it is Arunachal Pradesh or Taiwan or the Senkaku Islands or even the Spratlys, China is dangling the threat of force to assert its claims.
By picking territorial fights with its neighbors, China is not only reinforcing old rivalries, but is also threatening Asia’s continued economic renaissance – showing that it is not a credible candidate to lead Asia.
It is important for other Asian states and the US – a “resident power” in Asia, in the words of US Defense Secretary Robert Gates – to convey a clear message to China: a peaceful rise and unilateral redrawing of frontiers don’t mix.

Quitting the Quota
HONG KONG – On March 1, China’s State Council announced a new batch of restrictions aimed at reining in property prices by curbing speculative demand.
The measures include tighter limits on home purchases by non-locals in cities with excessive price gains, a reinforced 20% capital-gains tax, mandatory 70% down payments, and a 30% benchmark interest-rate premium for second mortgages.
While the previous round of housing-sector restrictions, implemented less than two years ago, dampened market sentiment temporarily, it failed to curb rising property prices.
Likewise, although the latest measures might have some impact, cooling China’s turbulent property market – which relies on cheap credit – in the long term will require addressing underlying monetary-policy weaknesses.
In order to control the money supply, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has long used credit quotas as “window guidance” to banks.
The policy is rooted in central planning, which, three decades ago, led to artificially low prices and, in turn, to shortages of basic necessities and key production inputs, such as grain and steel.
As the free market developed, a dual-price system emerged, in which those with access to quota-allocated goods paid less. As a result, the government was compelled to grant subsidies to the system’s “losers” – such as urban residents and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – until strong supply responses to rising market prices eliminated the need for quotas on manufactured products.
A decade later, in response to the global financial crisis, China loosened credit quotas and planning controls on SOE-run local-government infrastructure projects.
Between November 2008 and June 2009, China’s banks issued more than ¥8.6 trillion ($1.3 trillion) in new loans.
As a result, the rate of credit growth increased from 14% in September 2008 to 35% a year later, and property prices more than doubled in many cities.
Excessively low interest rates have generated a mismatch between housing prices and the available supply, because they serve as hidden subsidies for those who can borrow – for example, the rich and SOEs – and thus stimulate demand for luxury property.
In order to curb this trend, policymakers have reverted to the quota as a macroeconomic tool, but this time for housing credit.
Like quotas on manufactured products, these new quotas are generating a dual-price allocation system, in which SOEs can borrow at significantly lower interest rates than small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), which must rely on the informal market at interest rates as high as 2% monthly.
But eliminating quotas in order to allow prices to reach market-clearing levels is not an option this time, owing to the complexity and competitiveness of the real-estate and bank-credit markets.
Three major factors are impeding policymakers from raising interest rates to market-clearing levels. First, the domestic interest groups that benefit from low borrowing costs have become a barrier to their liberalization.
There is a “common-sense consensus” among borrowers – in China, as well as in highly indebted advanced economies – that raising interest rates would undermine GDP growth, employment, and asset prices.
Second, many argue that raising interest rates would trigger a flood of speculative capital from low-yielding advanced economies.
With the PBOC unable to sterilize the inflows, upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate would threaten competitiveness.
Finally, an inadequate understanding of structural inflation (the growth in prices for non-tradable assets) has generated the false belief that China can maintain similar levels of inflation and exchange-rate stability as the OECD economies.
As a result, over the last decade, the Chinese authorities’ implicit target for annual inflation and currency appreciation has been only about 3%.
But China has attained much higher GDP growth than the OECD economies, driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characterize the initial “catch up” phase of emerging-market development.
As China continues to implement market-oriented reforms, the prices of non-tradable assets – such as property, natural resources, utilities, services, and wages – will continue to rise much faster than in the OECD countries, until they eventually converge.
This process will inevitably lead to higher structural inflation and currency appreciation in China.
If nominal interest rates are lower than the real return on investment – associated with GDP growth – the result is financial repression and increased income and wealth inequality.
To avoid this outcome, as long as China’s GDP growth exceeds that of OECD economies, its nominal interest rates must also be higher, its exchange rate must be more flexible, and it must tolerate higher structural inflation.
Indeed, despite domestic resistance, the PBOC must raise nominal interest rates so that they are in line with structural inflation.
Such a move would deter excessive investment in productive capacity, and ease the implementation of a more flexible exchange-rate regime.
At the same time, one need only recall the damage that unregulated carry trades wrought on Asian economies in the 1990’s to understand why China must erect barriers to protect its domestic markets from inflows of hot money.
The alternative to this price-oriented approach – continued dependence on the quota system – would incur considerable administrative expenses, efficiency losses, and social costs stemming from rent-seeking and corruption.
Much like the quota system of 30 years ago, the current reliance on quotas is unsustainable in the long term.
To manage exorbitant demand for financial and physical assets, China’s leaders must address its root cause: the low cost of capital. Doing so will require maintaining some capital-account control, while raising interest rates to market-clearing levels.
This, not the unsustainable imposition of quotas, is the real monetary-policy challenge facing China today.

Should Europe Regulate Sovereign Wealth Funds?
WIESBADEN – State-controlled investments from overseas – so-called sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) – are now the subject of intense debate.
The United States and France have made their fears known.
In Germany, too, the debate centers on SWFs’ political and economic significance for the country’s future.
The problem has been exacerbated by the growing wealth of a number of countries, some of them formerly run by socialist or communist regimes.
China, Russia, India, and the Gulf States have integrated their wealth into the global economy, to the immense benefit of world trade.
The openness of Germany’s markets makes them especially attractive to global trade.
This openness will not change, yet there are some who now call for new safety fences – in other words, for protection.
For example, Russian investors are interested in taking a massive share in the German-French aerospace company EADS, which is already 5%-owned by a Russian bank.
For many, this proposal has underscored a change in investors’ behavior.
But what, exactly, has changed?
SWFs have been around for years.
Among the first countries to invest their considerable state-owned funds were Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Singapore.
They invested, and still invest, their budgetary surpluses worldwide in government bonds and state-owned enterprises.
Industrialized countries like the US and Japan also have so-called “reserve funds.”
Some of these funds are huge.
In the UAE, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has estimated capital assets of $875 billion, making it probably the world’s largest state-owned investment company.
In July 2007, another rich UAE fund, Dubai International Capital, bought 3% of EADS, after taking a stake of almost 2% in the automotive manufacturer Daimler in January 2006.
The Kuwait Investment Authority, also a state-owned fund, holds 7% of Daimler.
Singapore possesses two SWFs – Temasek-Holdings, with capital assets of roughly $100 billion, and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, with approximately $330 billion.
Both funds are invested worldwide, including with the port operator PSA.
Some funds are subject to considerable restrictions.
Japan limits its state investments overseas to bonds, mostly those issued by the US. Until recently, China, which holds foreign currency reserves of more than $1.2 trillion (the world’s largest), followed this policy, too.
But a $3 billion investment by the Chinese SWF in the US investment firm Blackstone suggests a more worryingly strategic investment policy, one that appears aimed at advancing its own industrial interests in certain markets.
Russia, where the line between state-controlled and privately controlled companies is often blurry, has demonstrated this strategy in Europe.
Indeed, Russian investments in aerospace, telecommunications, and, most of all, in the energy sector, are the main source of concern for Germany.
Are state-controlled investors now aiming primarily for strategic rather than purely financial returns?
Because SWFs’ resources are so substantial, it is advisable to take precautions to avoid becoming a target of politically motivated market manipulation, or becoming economically and psychologically dependent on foreign governments’ decisions.
Most Western countries already have instruments to deter foreigners from making unwanted investments, not only in defense industries, but also in other sectors.
But, while Germany’s Foreign Trade and Payments Act protects against takeovers in the defense industry (though the law needs strengthening) elsewhere Germany has no system for examining investments by SWFs that may be strategically motivated.
The International Monetary Fund now encourages more transparency by foreign investors, and has plans for a code of conduct.
The EU Commission also favors voluntary agreements aimed at strengthening transparency.
Some SWFs now seem willing to engage in constructive dialogue.
But assessing potential threats is not easy.
Most investments are seen to benefit a country’s economy, if not its security.
We in Germany need to distinguish one from the other.
Bills have been drafted that amount to amendments to the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and related regulations.
While strengthening the act, they seek to avoid affecting the openness of the German economy.
Under proposed new legislation, if a foreign investment in a German company amounts to more than 25%, an assessment can be made of whether public order or safety might be threatened.
In my view, this would address the concerns about SWFs, while not generally impeding investment because it would apply only in a very few cases.
Germany has also drawn up a plan to protect its industries that is modeled on US regulation.
Since 1988, the US president can prohibit foreign direct investment if it is seen as a threat to national security.
An additional control was introduced last year, so now all direct investments in which a foreign government is involved are scrutinized by the Committee on Foreign Direct Investment.
The principle of reciprocity should clearly apply to transnational investments.
Germany is open to foreign investors, but in return we Germans demand the same market access abroad.
Much remains to be done in this area even in Europe, as Germany’s own experiences with France and Spain demonstrate.
In China and almost all Middle Eastern countries, foreigners are restricted to minority shareholdings and must contend with high import duties and numerous non-tariff barriers.
Protective measures must remain the exception rather than the rule.
We Europeans must accept the challenges of global competition, and transnational investments are the basis of thriving economic development at home and abroad.
Nevertheless, we must not allow ourselves to become the passive economic playthings of other nations, or of big state-owned enterprises.
We must play an active part in shaping globalization, and that means crafting appropriate rules.

Berlusconi at Bay
Silvio Berlusconi, who becomes President of the European Union on July 1 st , is a man of vision who once loved risk--and whose business bets paid off big.
In the 1960's, he was the first to see that Milan, then a traditional Italian city where people walked to work, would become a modern metropolis, surrounded by American-style suburbs.
So his fortune began in real estate development.
Fifteen years later, Signor Berlusoni understood that the Italian state's monopoly of television would not survive and jump-started what became Italy's main privately owned media group.
But you don't win in TV and the real estate business without the right political connections.
On both occasions, Berlusconi outwitted his competitors by siding with the Socialists, at the time the rising stars of Italian political life.
His long association with Bettino Craxi, Milan's most influential politician in the 1970's and Italy's prime minister through much of the 1980's, started early.
On the other hand, political connections do not make a politician.
Indeed, the jump from business into politics was probably not Berlusconi's own preference.
By the 1990's, his media group was in trouble, weakened by excessive diversification (the decision to enter the retail-distribution business almost destroyed the group).
Almost at the same time, ex-premier Craxi fled to Tunisia, chased there by the Italian courts at the height of the mani pulite (clean hands) investigation into the vast network of corruption known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).
Craxi's flight and exile left Berlusconi feeling lost--and without the reliable political backing that he needed.
So he decided that he needed to become his own political sponsor.
As has happened frequently in Italian history, Berlusconi's decision to form a new political party, Forza Italia , just a few months before the 1994 general election paid off handsomely.
Berlusconi's lack of experience in politics doomed his first government to collapse after only six months.
Any other man as rich as Berlusconi would probably have given up.
But Berlusconi remained and led the opposition for six years.
In 2001 his determination was rewarded with a clear victory and, more importantly, a seemingly clear mandate for change.
Once again Berlusconi probably had no choice: by the late 1990's, his association with the disgraced Socialists was haunting him politically and legally.
His only hope of fending off the magistrates was to control parliament and introduce new laws that would stop the series of corruption trials he faces--a strategy that has now given him immunity from prosecution until he leaves office. Unfortunately, while Berlusconi's government is invariably long on speeches, legal provisions designed to stop the clock on his court cases are among the few laws that have passed in his two years of government.
Berlusconi's performance in government is a combination of good intuition--for instance the early attempt to reform Italian pensions in 1994--and poor implementation, most likely because of a lack of courage, as surprising as that seems.
In 1994, during his first government, he understood early on that Italy needed to overhaul its pension system, and introduced bold legislation. But one general strike was enough to kill his reformist zeal.
More recently, he courageously sided with the US on the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and most of his own political coalition.
But soon he seemed scared of his own boldness and faded into an almost invisible ally.
Despite Berlusconi's rhetoric, he did not go (or was not invited) to the summit meeting with President Bush in the Azores, where the final decision to go to war was taken.
On labor reforms, he fought the unions head on, but he chose the wrong fight: Italy's infamous "Article 18," which allows labor courts to return a worker to his job if a judge believes that the worker was unjustly fired.
But while Article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.
The outcome was a confrontation with the unions that distracted from more important labor reforms.
Contrary to what happened in 1994, Berlusconi's current government survives, but whoever hoped for a free-market revolution will be disappointed.
There has been no tax cut of any significance, and pension reform is still waiting.
Berlusconi's powerful finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, speaks often and fondly of the necessity of renewed government intervention in the economy; nothing is done to prevent strikes in the public transportation sector.
Moderate right-wing voters, who wanted an Italian (i.e., somewhat watered-down) version of the Reagan/Thatcher era are disillusioned.
Berlusconi tries to mask his inactivity by scaring his voters, repeating again and again that electing the moderate left would mean signing a pact with the devil, i.e., the "communists."
Italians seem smarter, as the result of the June administrative elections clearly have shown.
Why has the courageous visionary of the 1960's and 1970's lost his shine?
Part of it is precisely that it is no longer the 1960's and 1970's: Berlusconi is 40 years older and for the past ten years has lived in the world of Roman politics.
There he learned the art of political (and personal) survival, but lost his vision and his love for risk taking.

Should Children Have the Right to Die?
PRINCETON – Since 2002, Belgium has permitted terminally or incurably ill adults to request and receive euthanasia from a doctor.
In February 2014, the Belgian parliament removed the provision of the country’s law on euthanasia that restricted the law’s use to adults.
That led to an outcry.
Predictably, the uproar resumed last month when the first minor requested and received euthanasia.
Cardinal Elio Sgreccia, speaking on Radio Vatican, said that the Belgian law denies children the right to life.
But the circumstances of the case, and the fact that it took two and a half years for this to happen, show just the opposite: the Belgian law respects the right to life – and, in carefully defined circumstances, the right to die.
Although Belgium’s euthanasia law now has no specific age requirement – thus differing from Dutch legislation, which permits doctors to provide euthanasia, on request, to minors who are at least 12 years old – it does require the person requesting euthanasia to have a demonstrable capacity for rational decision-making.
This effectively excludes very small children from the law’s scope.
The request must be examined by a team of doctors and a psychiatrist or psychologist, and requires the approval of the minor’s parents.
The minor has to be “in a hopeless medical situation of constant and unbearable suffering that cannot be eased and which will cause death in the short term.”
In announcing the first use of the law by a minor, Wim Distelmans, the head of Belgium’s federal euthanasia commission, pointed out that there are very few children for whom the question of euthanasia is raised.
He added that this is not a reason for refusing a dignified death for those who request it and meet the law’s stringent requirements.
Although no details about the minor were initially provided, it was subsequently revealed that he or she was 17 years old.
The patient would therefore also have been eligible for euthanasia in the Netherlands.
If Cardinal Sgreccia had responded to the teenager’s death by saying that the Belgian law denies that children have a duty to live, he might have begun a useful debate that would have clarified differences between those who believe that there is such a duty and those who do not.
Thomas Aquinas, still an influential figure in the Catholic tradition, thought that we have a duty not to end our own life because to do so is a sin against God.
He illustrated this claim by drawing an analogy between ending one’s own life and killing a slave belonging to someone else, which means that one “sins against that slave’s master.” Putting aside that grotesquely insensitive analogy, it is obvious that this argument provides no reason against suicide for people who do not believe in the existence of a god.
Even theists will struggle to understand why a benevolent deity should want someone who is dying to remain alive until the last possible moment, no matter how severe the pain, discomfort, or loss of dignity may be.
There is a further reason why even Cardinal Sgreccia might hesitate to assert that there is a duty to live.
The Catholic Church has long accepted that it is not obligatory for a doctor or a patient to continue all means of life support, irrespective of the patient’s condition or prognosis.
In Catholic hospitals everywhere, respirators and other forms of life support are withdrawn from patients when the burdens of continuing the treatment are judged “disproportionate” to the benefits likely to be achieved.
That surely indicates that any duty to live is subject to the benefits of continued life outweighing the burdens of treatment.
Patients requesting euthanasia judge that the benefits of continued life do not outweigh the burdens of treatment, or of continuing to live, with or without treatment.
A right, however, is different from a duty.
I have a right to freedom of expression, but I may remain silent.
I have a right to my body parts, but I may donate a kidney to a relative, a friend, or a complete stranger who is suffering from kidney failure.
My right gives me a choice.
I can choose to exercise it or to waive it.
Age limits are always to some extent arbitrary.
Chronological age and mental age can diverge.
For some activities for which a mental age limit may be relevant, the number of people engaging in the activity is very large: voting, obtaining a driving license, and having sex, for example. But it would be very costly to scrutinize whether every person interested in those activities has the capacity to understand what is involved in voting, driving responsibly, or giving informed consent to sex.
That is why we rely on chronological age as a rough indication of the relevant mental capacity.
This is not true of minors requesting euthanasia.
If the number of those who meet the requirements of the law is so small that Belgium has had only one case over the past two years, it is not difficult to carry out a thorough examination of these patients’ capacities to make such a request.
For these reasons, Belgium’s extension of its law on euthanasia to minors with a demonstrable capacity for rational decision-making does not deny anyone’s right to life.
On the contrary, it grants a right to die to those who may reasonably choose to exercise that right.

A Better Year for Migrants?
DUBLIN – The Mediterranean migration crisis has delivered two critical lessons.
First, Europe and the international community have grossly inadequate systems for protecting vulnerable migrants.
Second, in the absence of such systems, populist leaders will prey on fear to gain political support, undermining the liberal, tolerant societies that have taken 70 years of hard work to build.
That is why vigorous action at the European and global levels is essential this year.
In September, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will convene an extraordinary summit dedicated to building a fair global system for protecting refugees and vulnerable migrants.
One hopes that countries will come prepared to make tangible, enduring commitments.
Such commitments were sorely lacking in 2015.
Indeed, the international community could have blunted last year’s crisis by providing even modest support for the three frontline countries – Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan – which together host some four million Syrian refugees.
With only around €10 billion ($10.8 billion), these countries could have provided better housing, food, and education for refugees, thereby reducing the incentive to flee to Europe.
That failure could end up costing Germany alone upwards of €21 billion annually for years to come.
But the financial implications of the crisis pale in comparison to the human and political costs.
More than a million people risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean last year, and then endured grueling journeys through the Balkans.
Almost 4,000 people died on the way, and many European countries turned their backs on those who survived, refusing them safe haven.
Cynical political leaders ruthlessly capitalized on popular anxiety by promoting an odious nationalist vision that either ignores or distorts real-life experiences with immigration.
In the United States, for example, not one of the 780,000 refugees resettled since September 11, 2001, has executed a terrorist attack.
Meanwhile, immigrants typically pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits.
Nonetheless, extremist forces are dangerously close to taking political power in some European states, and are gaining traction even in formerly liberal bastions.
Anti-migrant parties already are in power in Hungary and Poland.
Their success is compelling mainstream parties to adopt anti-migrant policies as well.
All of this has seriously undermined European cooperation.
The EU’s program to process the million refugees who arrived on its shores has succeeded in “relocating” a mere 190 of them.
Checks at the borders of six countries within the Schengen Area have been reinstituted, at least temporarily.
To the rest of the world, the EU appears chauvinistic and inept.
Of course, the crisis is not solely for Europe to solve; responsibility is not defined by proximity.
But the EU might now face an existential threat, which it can overcome only with a strong show of solidarity and global leadership.
That is why its member states must take the lead in proposing solutions.
The most urgent priority is to create safe and legal paths for refugees to reach Europe.
This does not imply that every vulnerable migrant must be accepted.
But the EU should be more systematically generous in determining how many to admit, and it should implement organized ways to facilitate their entry.
Such a system would protect migrants and safeguard Europe (by enabling it to vet applicants fully).
Beyond reducing the incentive for asylum-seekers to risk their lives and life savings to cross the Mediterranean, such an approach would show solidarity with the frontline countries, which will continue to host most of the refugees.
Equally important, it would put pressure on the rest of the international community to contribute.
That brings us to the second priority for 2016: building a robust global system to protect refugees and other vulnerable migrants.
This requires, first and foremost, agreement by more countries to accept refugees.
In recent years, the UN Refugee Agency has been able to resettle fewer than 75,000 of more than 20 million refugees annually.
Millions end up in protracted displacement, spending an estimated 25 years, on average, stuck in limbo, unsure when they might return home.
In 2016, developed countries should agree to accept a combined total approaching a million refugees annually, either through resettlement or by issuing humanitarian, student, labor, and other visas.
With Canada alone saying that it will resettle 50,000 Syrian refugees this year, it is clear that this target is achievable.
At the same time, the international community must support the integration of refugees in major host countries like Turkey, Kenya, Lebanon, and Jordan.
As it stands, such countries receive just a fraction of the $3,000-5,000 per refugee required annually to provide adequate housing, food, health care, schooling, and job training during the first few years of displacement.
And that does not account for the costs of building or upgrading infrastructure. Lebanon’s water-supply system, for example, is faltering under the strain of the massive influx of refugees.
In exchange for funding, host countries should agree to integrate refugees fully into their schools, labor markets, and civic institutions.
But integrating migrants effectively will be impossible unless European and other countries change how they perceive migrants.
If migrants are viewed as a burden or, worse, a security threat, reactionary political forces will continue to gain ground, cutting off opportunities for newcomers and turning such fears into a self-fulfilling prophesy. If, however, host countries enthusiastically integrate migrants, everyone will benefit – including home countries (for example, through remittances).
Last month in Paris, the international community proved that it could subordinate national self-interest to a greater global goal: confronting climate change.
In 2016, the same thing must happen to forge a better system for protecting migrants.
It is a matter of life and death for 20 million refugees and millions of other vulnerable migrants – and a profound test of the civic health of democratic societies worldwide.

The Chinese Economy’s Secret Recipe
BEIJING – China’s GDP growth this year may approach 10%.
While some countries are still dealing with economic crisis or its aftermath, China’s challenge is – once again – how to manage a boom.
Thanks to decisive policy moves to pre-empt a housing bubble, the real-estate market has stabilized, and further corrections are expected soon.
This is good news for China’s economy, but disappointing, perhaps, to those who assumed that the government would allow the bubble to grow bigger and bigger, eventually precipitating a crash.
Whether or not the housing correction will hit overall growth depends on how one defines “hit.”
Lower asset prices may slow total investment growth and GDP, but if the slowdown is (supposedly) from 11% to 9%, China will avoid economic over-heating yet still enjoy sustainable high growth.
Indeed, for China, the current annualized growth rate of 37% in housing investment is very negative. Ideally, it would slow to, say, 27% this year!
China has sustained rapid economic growth for 30 years without significant fluctuations or interruption – so far.
Excluding the 1989-1990 slowdown that followed the Tiananmen crisis, average annual growth over this period was 9.45%, with a peak of 14.2% in 1994 and 2007, and a nadir of 7.6% in 1999.
While most major economies in their early stages of growth suffered crises, China’s story seems abnormal (or accidental), and has elicited periodic predictions of an “upcoming crash.”
All such predictions have proved wrong, but the longer the story lasts, the more people forecast a bad end.
For me, there is nothing more abnormal about China’s unbroken pattern of growth than effective macroeconomic intervention in boom times.
To be sure, both economic development and institutional reforms may cause instability.
Indeed, the type of central government inherited from the old planned economy, with its over-stretched growth plans, causes fluctuations, and contributed significantly to instability in the early 1980’s.
But the central government must be responsible for inflation in times of overheating, lest a bursting bubble fuel unemployment.
Local governments and state-owned enterprises do not necessarily have those concerns.
They want high GDP growth, without worrying much about the macroeconomic consequences.
They want to borrow as much as possible to finance ambitious investment projects, without worrying much about either repayment or inflation.
Indeed, the main cause of overheating in the early 1990’s was over-borrowing by local governments.
Inflation soared to 21% in 1994 – its highest level over the past 30 years – and a great deal of local debt ended up as non-performing loans, which amounted to 40% of total credits in the state banking sector in the mid-1990’s. This source of vulnerability has become less important, owing to tight restrictions imposed since the 1990’s on local governments’ borrowing capacity.
Now, however, the so-called “animal spirits” of China’s first generation of entrepreneurs have become another source of overheating risk.
The economy has been booming, income has been rising, and markets have been expanding: all this creates high potential for enterprises to grow; all want to seize new opportunities, and every investor want to get rich fast.
They have been successful and, so far, have not experienced bad times.
So they invest and speculate fiercely without much consideration of risk.
The relatively high inflation of the early 1990’s was a warning to central government policymakers about the macroeconomic risks posed by fast growth.
The bubble bursts in Japan’s economy in the early 1990’s, and the Southeast Asian economies later in the decade, provided a neighborly lesson to stop believing that bubbles never burst.
Since then, the central government’s policy stance has been to put brakes on the economy whenever there is a tendency toward over-heating.
Stringent measures were implemented in the early 1990’s to reduce the money supply and stop over-investment, thereby heading off hyperinflation.
In the recent cycle, the authorities began cooling down the economy as early as 2004, when China had just emerged from the downturn caused by the SARS scare in 2003.
In late 2007, when GDP growth hit 13%, the government adopted more restrictive anti-bubble policies in industries (steel, for example) and asset markets (real estate), which set the stage for an early correction.
Economic theory holds that all crises are caused by bubbles or over-heating, so if you can manage to prevent bubbles, you can prevent crises.
The most important thing for “ironing out cycles” is not the stimulus policy implemented after a crash has already occurred, but to be proactive in boom times and stop bubbles in their early stages.
I am not quite sure whether all Chinese policymakers are good students of modern economics.
But it seems that what they have been doing in practice happened to be better than what their counterparts in some other countries were doing – a lot on “de-regulation,” but too little on cooling things down when the economy was booming and bubbles were forming.
The problem for the world economy is that everybody remembered Keynes’s lesson about the need for countercyclical policies only when the crisis erupted, after demanding to be left alone – with no symmetric policy intervention – during the preceding boom.
But managing the boom is more important, because it addresses what causes crises in the first place.
In a sense, what China has been doing seems to me to be the creation of a true “Keynesian world”: more private business and freer price competition at the micro level, and active countercyclical policy intervention at the macro level.
There may be other factors that could slow down or interrupt China’s growth.
I only hope that policymakers’ vigilance will prevail (and be improved upon), enabling China’s high-growth story to continue for another 10, 20, or 30 years.

Why Wealth Taxes Are Not Enough
CAMBRIDGE – Should advanced countries implement wealth taxes as a means of stabilizing and reducing public debt over the medium term?
The normally conservative International Monetary Fund has given the idea surprisingly emphatic support.
The IMF calculates that a one-time 10% wealth levy, if introduced quickly and unexpectedly, could return many European countries to pre-crisis public debt/GDP ratios.
It is an intriguing idea.
The moral case for a wealth tax is more compelling than usual today, with unemployment still at recession levels, and with deep economic inequality straining social norms.
And, if it were really possible to ensure that the wealth levy would be temporary, such a tax would, in principle, be much less distortionary than imposing higher marginal tax rates on income. Unfortunately, while a wealth tax may be a sound way to help a country dig out of a deep fiscal pit, it is hardly a panacea.
For starters, the revenue gains from temporary wealth taxes can be very elusive.
The economist Barry Eichengreen once explored the imposition of capital levies in the aftermath of World Wars I and II. He found that, owing to capital flight and political pressure for delay, the results were often disappointing.
Italy’s armada of Guardia di Finanza boats would hardly forestall a massive exodus of wealth if Italians see a sizable wealth tax coming.
Over- and under-invoicing of trade, for example, is a time-tested way to spirit money out of a country.
(For example, an exporter under-reports the price received for a foreign shipment, and keeps the extra cash hidden abroad.)
And there would be a rush into jewelry and other hard-to-detect real assets.
The distortionary effects of a wealth levy would also be exacerbated by concerns that the “temporary” levy would not be a one-off tax.
After all, most temporary taxes come for lunch and stay for dinner.
Fears of future wealth taxes could discourage entrepreneurship and lower the saving rate.
In addition, the administrative difficulties of instituting a comprehensive wealth tax are formidable, raising questions about fairness.
For example, it would be extremely difficult to place market values on the family-owned businesses that pervade Mediterranean countries.
Wealth taxes that target land and structures are arguably insulated from some of these concerns, and property taxes are relatively underused outside the Anglo-Saxon countries.
In theory, taxing immobile assets is less distortionary, though taxes on structures obviously can discourage both maintenance and new construction.
So what else can eurozone governments do to raise revenue as their economies recover? Most economists favor finding ways to broaden the tax base – for example, by eliminating special deductions and privileges – in order to keep marginal tax rates low.
Broadening the income-tax base is a central element of the highly regarded Simpson/Bowles proposals for tax reform in the United States.
In Europe, efficiency would be enhanced by a unified VAT rate, instead of creating distortions by charging different rates for different goods.
In principle, low-income individuals and families could be compensated through lump-sum transfer programs.
Another idea is to try to raise more revenue from carbon permits or taxes.
Raising funds by taxing negative externalities reduces distortions rather than creating them. Though such taxes are spectacularly unpopular – perhaps because individuals refuse to admit that the externalities they themselves create are significant – I regard them as an important direction for future policy (and I intend to suggest other ideas along these lines in future columns).
Unfortunately, advanced countries have implemented very little fundamental tax reform so far.
Many governments are giving in to higher marginal tax rates rather than overhauling and simplifying the system.
In Europe, officials are also turning to stealth taxes, particularly financial repression, to resolve high public-debt overhangs. Through regulation and administrative directives, banks, insurance companies, and pension funds are being forced to hold much higher shares of government debt than they might voluntarily choose to do.
But this approach is hardly progressive, as the final holders of pensions, insurance contracts, and bank deposits are typically the beleaguered middle class and the elderly.
There is also the unresolved question of how much the periphery countries really should be asked to pay on their debilitating debt burdens, whatever the tax instrument.
Although the IMF seems particularly enthusiastic about using wealth taxes to resolve debt overhangs in Spain and Italy, some burden sharing with the north seems reasonable.
As the economists Maurice Obstfeld and Galina Hale recently noted, German and French banks earned large profits intermediating flows between Asian savers and Europe’s periphery. Unfortunately, arguing over burden sharing creates more scope for delay, potentially undermining the efficacy of any wealth tax that might finally be instituted.
Still, the IMF is right – on grounds of both fairness and efficiency – to raise the idea of temporary wealth taxes in advanced countries to relieve fiscal distress. However, the revenues will almost certainly be lower, and the costs higher, than calculations used to promote them would imply.
Temporary wealth taxes may well be a part of the answer for countries in fiscal trouble today, and the idea should be taken seriously.
But they are no substitute for fundamental long-term reform to make tax systems simpler, fairer, and more efficient.

Palestine’s House Divided
President George W. Bush’s call for a new peace conference for Israel, Palestine, and neighboring states that back a two-state solution is a welcome, if very tardy, development. But efforts to re-start the peace process now confront a stark new reality: two mutually hostile Palestinian entities in Hamas-ruled Gaza and the Fatah-led West Bank must now be factored into the process.
The Hamas/Fatah face-off marks a dramatic shift in Palestinian politics, whose top priorities until now has been an end to the Israeli occupation and the establishment of an independent state.
It also tremendously complicates peace negotiations, which both the Palestinians and the “Quartet” (the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia) had premised on maintaining the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as a single territorial unit.
Ironically, these territories were reunited by Israel’s victory in the 1967 war, after 19 years of separation.
Previously, Egypt had ruled in Gaza, while Jordan annexed the West Bank.
Under Israel’s occupation, and then with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 1994, the territories remained separated geographically, but not politically.
The Hamas takeover in Gaza has – at least for now – ended that political unification.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue.
Hamas must withdraw its armed men from all security headquarters they occupied, return power to the legitimate authority, and apologize to the Palestinian people.
Although internal division harms Palestinians’ national interest, it is unlikely amid mutual accusations and incitements that dialogue between Fatah and Hamas will be conducted soon.
But the fear that is most consuming Abbas and Fatah is that the conflict with Hamas might spread to the West Bank.
To avoid such a scenario, Abbas has banned all militias and military groups in the West Bank, including his Fatah Party’s al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.
Abbas has succeeded in convincing Israel to grant amnesty to many Fatah fugitives in the West Bank who will join his security apparatuses.
Abbas has also asked Israel to allow the PLO’s Badr Brigade, currently stationed in Jordan, to enter the West Bank.
That would give Abbas an additional 3,000 well-equipped and trained troops.
Following King Abdullah II of Jordan’s intervention, Israel appears to have agreed to allow the Badr Brigade’s entry with full arms and ammunition.
If Fatah is to become a viable partner for peace and regain its grassroots support, it must reform itself and end the widespread corruption that has undermined its reputation. Abbas must also share power with more disciplined, younger leaders.
Israel can help Abbas by releasing senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison.
Owing to his influence with the Fatah militias, Barghouti’s release could help Abbas and the discredited Fatah leadership, and boost the younger generation of Fatah leaders.
Israel is divided on how to deal with Hamas, which will also complicate the start of peace talks. Some Israelis argue that Hamas should be encouraged to establish order in Gaza and provide assurances to its neighbors.
If Hamas can establish order inside Gaza, prevent violence against Israel, and stop missile attacks against Israeli towns and villages, it might avoid Israeli military intervention.
But the dominant view in Israel is that Hamas is a direct threat, unwilling to stop attacks on Israel.
For Israel, last summer’s fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon demonstrated the risks of allowing radical Islamists to consolidate their power on Israel’s border.
Sooner or later, Israel is likely to deal with Hamas militarily, perhaps even by re-occupying Gaza.
One reason neighboring countries may take part in peace talks is that Egypt and Jordan fear that Hamas could begin actively to support these countries’ own Islamic opposition groups.
Moreover, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia – the three main Sunni Muslim regimes – are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non-Arab foe, Shiite Iran. Their fear is based on Iranian support for Islamist groups – Sunni and Shiite – in Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine, as well as its ongoing relationship with Syria.
If the Hamas-Fatah split brings about another territorial partition, Palestinians’ national aspirations will suffer their gravest setback in the last half-century.
Although the overwhelming majority of Palestinians reject the use of force to settle this power struggle, many welcome the change in Gaza, where Hamas has cleared the streets of armed militias and restored some law and order.
The Palestinians confront a harsh reality.
Whatever actions are taken to confront Hamas will undermine the Palestinian national project.
A house divided against itself cannot stand, said Abraham Lincoln.
And a Palestine divided against itself will never secure its independence.

An Alternative to Deposit Insurance
Argentina's financial panic and the run on its banks that ensued, as well as Asia's financial crisis of 1997, have forced a number of countries to consider adopting deposit insurance schemes to protect their citizens' savings.
But is deposit insurance the best defense against bank panics?
Deposit insurance was a response to banking crises of the type that plagued the United States until the 1930's. The first explicit scheme was introduced in America after the Great Depression and initially seemed an unmitigated success.
Panics no longer occurred, which stabilized the financial system and contributed to sustained post-war economic growth.
Deposit insurance did away with financial panics because bank runs are typically driven by a self-fulfilling prophecy. They occur when a bank's clients fear that most of their fellow depositors will withdraw their funds.
Because banks service their depositors on a first-come-first-served basis, those who wait risk being left empty-handed, because the bank may be forced to liquidate its long term-assets at a loss and run out of resources.
So fear of a panic can create a panic.
This is highly inefficient, because while it is individually rational for depositors to want their money immediately, the bank might have been able to service all of them had they been collectively patient.
Economists call such situations "coordination failures," if depositors could talk to each other and coordinate their actions, they would be able to avoid a self-defeating run on the bank.
By guaranteeing that there will be enough resources available for patient clients when they want to withdraw their funds, deposit insurance eliminates the coordination failure. Patient depositors no longer need to worry about others withdrawing their funds because it has no effect on them.
But deposit insurance leads to other problems, which first appeared with the Savings and Loan crisis in the US during the 1980's.
Deposit insurance creates what economists call "moral hazard," people who are insured against an unpleasant event are not as careful as they would otherwise be in trying to avoid that event.
If my bicycle is insured against theft, I might buy a cheaper lock for it, making it more likely that it will be stolen. With deposit insurance, clients who no longer risk losing their money have no incentive to monitor their bank, while banks, with no one watching, have incentives to invest in excessively risky projects.
Although many factors contributed to the Savings and Loan crisis, it is generally agreed that moral hazard was a major one.
Following that crisis, deposit insurance in the US was reformed with the objective of mitigating the moral hazard problem.
But did the reforms go far enough?
There are ways to improve the existing system, but is something altogether different and better possible?
As far back as 1873, in his classic book on central banking, Lombard Street, Walter Bagehot noted that central banks should be able to prevent financial panics by injecting liquidity into the economy. I have studied policies of the type proposed by Bagehot in a way that allows me to compare them with deposit insurance schemes.
The main conclusion of my work is that policies aimed at ensuring liquidity can not only prevent bank panics, but also avoid the excess risk-taking that deposit insurance encourages.
In case of panic, a good policy should help banks that have enough assets to cover their deposits but that can't pay all depositors at the same time because some assets are tied up in real estate or other long-term investments. These banks are illiquid but not insolvent.
The central bank can help with familiar tools.
Under a repurchase agreement, for example, monetary authorities buy assets from an illiquid bank under the promise that the bank will then buy the assets back on a specified date and for a specified price.
In this way, the bank temporarily exchanges its illiquid assets for cash, pays off its depositors, and avoids doing so at a loss.
As with deposit insurance, repurchase agreements solve the coordination failure problem because depositors know that, even if they wait, the bank will be able to accommodate their withdrawals.
In contrast to deposit insurance, however, liquidity provision can avoid moral hazard by helping only those banks that are solvent. Depositors still have a strong incentive to monitor their banks.
Consider a bank that has invested in risky projects and finds itself in trouble.
It can ask the central bank for help and sell some of its assets for cash.
However, under the agreement with the central bank, it must buy its assets back.
If the assets are worthless, it will ultimately be forced out of business.
If it declares bankruptcy and refuses to buy back its assets, bankruptcy laws should give the central bank the first claim on the bank's assets.
This creates a powerful incentive for depositors and investors to monitor their bank's performance.
Implementing liquidity provision policies like those advocated by Bagehot would prevent bank panics without the incentive for undue risk-taking associated with deposit insurance.
Depositors deserve strong, effective protection for their funds--and the banking system requires it in order to maintain confidence. But neither depositors nor their banks should be given a free ride.

Kofi Annan’s Unfinished Green Revolution
GENEVA – Kofi Annan championed many global causes during his distinguished life and career, but as a native of Ghana, he always felt a special responsibility to Africa.
And there, no issue was more important to him than tackling hunger and spurring growth through agriculture.
During his tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations, Annan, who died last month, often wondered why so much of Africa – with its abundance of fertile land and freshwater – had failed to turn farming into an asset. He even commissioned a study for the UN to analyze why “green revolutions” – agricultural reforms in Asia and Latin America that lifted millions out of poverty and accelerated economic transformations – had bypassed Africa.
That study reached a straightforward conclusion: while Africa’s farmers have the potential to meet the continent’s nutritional needs, they cannot do it alone. The study’s findings led Annan to advocate for a “uniquely African green revolution” to increase farm productivity, and his plea later became the basis for the African Green Revolution Forum.
This week, the AGRF – one of the world’s most important platforms for African agriculture – will gather for its annual meeting to discuss ways to help the continent feed itself.
Africa’s agricultural sector has come a long way since 2010, when Annan chaired the first AGRF meeting, in Accra.
Today, governments across the continent, including in Rwanda, this year’s host country, have placed agriculture at the center of their socioeconomic policies.
This focus is creating jobs and improving food security and nutrition, while innovative partnerships are helping to build more viable, inclusive agribusinesses.
And yet, despite progress, millions of Africans continue to suffer from hunger and extreme poverty.
As leaders prepare for another round of AGRF discussions, Annan’s vision of a food-secure and prosperous Africa is more relevant than ever.
Today, five key challenges are impeding Africa’s agricultural progress; each needs urgent attention.
First, Africa’s governments must make good on pledges to allocate at least 10% of public spending to agriculture.
At the moment, only 13 countries are hitting this mark.
Simply put, Africa will continue to fall short of its economic potential if public and private investment in agriculture is not increased.
Second, Africa needs an accountability system to measure policies and progress against key performance indicators.
To that end, the African Union should endorse a new African Leaders for Nutrition initiative that is developing scorecards for agriculture and nutrition programs.
Third, regional and international donors must direct more aid to the millions of smallholder farmers who rely on agriculture to make ends meet.
Africa’s small farmers can be integrated into agricultural value chains, but not without first increasing farm productivity. To improve yields, smallholder farmers need access to high-quality seeds and fertilizers, innovative financing, and modern technology.
Most important, support must be directed to the future of African agriculture – young people and women.
Fourth, the volume of agricultural trade between countries must be increased, which can be accomplished by harmonizing trade regulations, lowering transportation costs, reducing tariffs, and improving warehouse and cold-storage facilities. A more robust intra-African food trade would promote economic growth, attract new investors, create jobs, and help prevent food insecurity.
Finally, everyone involved in strengthening Africa’s agricultural sector – from donors to farmers – must never forget the transformative power of partnerships.
Rather than working at odds, Africa’s governments, businesses, financial institutions, NGOs, and farmers’ organizations should pool their resources and expertise whenever possible.
In 2006, when Annan stepped down as UN Secretary-General, he commented that in his next job, people might call him “Farmer Kofi.”
Many of his colleagues assumed he was joking; he wasn’t.
While his post-UN portfolio ranged from peacebuilding in Syria to political dialogue in Kenya, he never stopped advocating for Africa’s smallholder farmers.
For Annan, the eradication of hunger was not an end but rather a means to creating a more just and peaceful world.
As he put it in an interview in 2013, “a hungry man is not a free man,” because he can focus only on his next meal.
Now that Annan is gone, it is up to the rest of us to ensure that his vision of freedom for Africa is realized.

Soulless Bodies
The world’s leading scholar in artificial intelligence once described people as machines made of meat.
This nicely captures the consensus in the fields of psychology and neuroscience, which tell us that our mental lives are the products of our physical brains, and that these brains are shaped not by a divine creator, but by the blind process of natural selection.
But, with the exception of a small minority of philosophers and scientists, nobody takes this view seriously.
It is offensive.
It violates the tenets of every religion, and it conflicts with common sense.
We do not feel, after all, that we are just material bodies, mere flesh.
Instead, we occupy our bodies.
We own them.
We are spontaneously drawn to the view defended by René Descartes: We are natural-born dualists, so we see bodies and souls as separate.
This dualism has significant consequences for how we think, act, and feel. The philosopher Peter Singer discusses the notion of a moral circle – the circle of things that matter to us, that have moral significance.
This circle can be very small, including just your kin and those with whom you interact on a daily basis, or it can be extremely broad, including all humans, but also fetuses, animals, plants, and even the earth itself.
For most of us, the circle is mid-sized, and working out its precise boundaries – does it include stem cells, for instance? – can be a source of anguish and conflict.
The nature of these boundaries is related to our common-sense view that some objects have souls and others do not.
If one attributes a soul to something, then it has value; if one sees something as a mere body, it does not.
This is often explicit; historically, debates about abortion, for example, are often framed in terms of the question: When does the soul enter the body?
This reasoning can apply as well to how we regard adults.
Normally, when we interact with others we see them as both body and soul.
We appreciate that they have beliefs, desires, and consciousness, and we recognize that they are solid physical things that take up space and are subject to gravity.
Both stances coexist well enough in the normal course of things.
But when we emphasize one perspective over another, there are moral consequences.
Social psychologists have shown that simply getting an experimental subject to take another person’s perspective will make the subject care more about the person and be more likely to help.
Focusing on the soul, then, leads to moral concern, and can expand the moral circle.
The opposite can occur when someone is viewed solely as a body, and one emotion that supports this outcome is disgust.
The psychologist Paul Rozin has shown how disgust, as Charles Darwin first noted, is an evolutionary adaptation that deters us from bad meat, so it is naturally triggered by animals and animal waste products.
But disgust can readily extend to people.
People, after all, are made of meat. Hence, every movement designed to stigmatize or malign some group – Jews, blacks, gays, the poor, women, and so on – has used disgust.
Once a group of people is viewed as disgusting, attention shifts away from them as moral individuals.
They become soulless bodies, and the moral circle closes in to exclude them.
Our reaction to soulless bodies is well illustrated in a story told about Descartes after he died.
It was known that Descartes had an illegitimate daughter, Francine, who died when she was five years old.
According to the story, Descartes was so struck with grief that he created an automaton, a mechanical doll, built to appear identical to his dead daughter.
The two were inseparable.
When Descartes crossed the Holland Sea, he kept the doll in a small trunk in his cabin.
Curious about the contents of the trunk, the captain of the ship crept down to Descartes’ cabin one night and opened it.
To his horror, the robot Francine arose.
The captain, struck with revulsion, grabbed her, dragged her up to the deck of the ship, and threw her overboard.
This story captures how disturbing – in some cases, revolting – we find a body without a soul, and it embodies the emotional pull that our common-sense dualism often has. But it also raises a serious problem.
Science tells us that common-sense dualism is wrong.
There is no consensus as to precisely how mental life emerges from a physical brain, but there is no doubt that this is its source.
Thus, if a “soul” means something immaterial and immortal, then it does not exist.
All of us are soulless bodies, no less than the robot Francine.
This is perhaps the main reason why the scientific rejection of dualism may be so hard to swallow: it seems to diminish the moral status of people.
If we are to accept scientific facts, we need to construct morality on a new foundation, one without souls.

No Agnostics in the Climate Foxhole
SYDNEY – On a recent 14.5-hour flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, I had time to read the columnist Charles Krauthammer’s collection of essays, Things that Matter.
It made for a disturbing flight.
I have enjoyed Krauthammer’s writing over the years, but there was something in his book that I found deeply troubling: his description of himself as an “agnostic” on climate change.
He “believes instinctively that it can’t be very good to pump lots of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,” and yet he “is equally convinced that those who presume to know exactly where that leads are talking through their hats.”
The word that I found most galling was “agnostic” – not only because Krauthammer is a trained scientist, but also because the word was used repeatedly by former Australian Prime Minister John Howard when he addressed a group of climate-change deniers in London in late 2013.
“Part of the problem with this debate,” Howard told the assembled skeptics, “is that to some of the zealots involved their cause has become a substitute religion.”
As Howard and Krauthammer should know, the subject of climate change is not a matter of religion, but of science.
According to a 2013 survey of peer-reviewed publications on the subject, some 97% of scientists endorse the position that humans are causing global warming.
Anyone familiar with the scientific process is aware that researchers are trained to disagree, to contest one another’s hypotheses and conclusions.
A consensus of such magnitude is as close as we ever get to a recognized scientific fact.
Given that even Krauthammer concedes that pumping the atmosphere full of carbon dioxide “can’t be very good,” the next logical step in the debate is to determine the best way to address the problem. As an economist, I favor an auction-based cap-and-trade system to put a price on carbon.
But I also understand the potential usefulness of regulatory measures like targets for renewable energy, bans on incandescent light bulbs, and mandates for the use of biofuels.
What I cannot accept is for somebody who offers no solutions to claim that those of us who do are “talking through our hats.”
Fortunately, voices like Krauthammer’s are becoming increasingly rare.
To be sure, there are still holdouts, like Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who replaced a carbon tax with a plan to tax the country’s citizens in order to pay polluters to cut emissions.
As a policy, this is inequitable, inefficient, and unlikely to lower emissions at a pace that is sufficient to meet the conditions of the global climate-change agreement expected to be reached in Paris in December.
A sure sign of a shift in mentality is the growing recognition by financial institutions that loans and investments may be overexposed to the risks of climate change.
These risks include natural disasters, more extreme weather, efforts by governments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and the knock-on effect of a technological revolution in renewables, energy efficiency, and alternative technologies.
According to the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, which I chair, the top 500 global asset owners are alarmingly exposed to the dangers of climate change.
More than half of their investments are in industries exposed to the dangers of climate change; less than 2% are in low-carbon intensive industries.
As a result, there is a risk that their investments and holdings will become “stranded,” as changes in policy or market conditions cut the value of infrastructure, other property, and fossil-fuel reserves.
As Hank Paulson, Secretary of the US Treasury when the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, once warned, the risks of a climate-induced financial crisis would dwarf those of the sub-prime crisis.
The price of coal, for example, has plunged to around half of its peak level, with plenty of room remaining on the downside.
Consequently, shares in coal companies have fallen by as much as 90%, leaving asset owners scrambling to divest.
By contrast, investing in a company like Tesla Motors – which has now developed a rechargeable battery for home use, which could lead to a sharp increase in the number of households switching to solar power – looks far more attractive.
As this realization percolates through the market, asset owners are hedging their bets by increasing their investments in low-carbon industries and companies like Tesla.
Over time, this will have a significant effect on the allocation of global investment funds.
Krauthammer may think that I am talking through my hat, but I am confident that soon enough he – and those who listen to him – will be eating theirs.

Colombia at Peace?
BOGOTÁ – The Framework Agreement for the End of the Armed Conflict in Colombia that has just been announced by President Juan Manuel Santos is a historic landmark for his country and all of Latin America.
It is also a tribute to diplomatic resourcefulness and negotiating skill.
The agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as the FARC, came after long years of failed attempts by Colombian governments of all political shades to reach an accommodation with the last, and among the most odious, guerrilla movement to have operated in Latin America.
Never before has the FARC – a monumental apparatus of terror, mass murder, and drug trafficking – agreed to discuss disarmament, its fighters’ social and political reintegration, victims’ rights, an end to drug production, and participation in “truth and responsibility” commissions to examine the crimes committed during a half-century of conflict.
But now it has.
This momentous shift reflects the decimation of the FARC following long years of struggle, the resilience of Colombian society, and, perhaps most important, Santos’s brilliant regional policy.
By weakening the so-called Bolivarian Axis (Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia), the FARC guerrillas were left without a supportive regional environment.
As with peace processes in the Middle East and Central America following the Cold War’s end, regional changes created the conditions for the start of the Colombian process.
But, in the Middle East and Central America, external actors – the United States and the Soviet Union – produced the change; in the case of the Colombian process, the change came from within.
Prior to engaging the FARC in secret talks in Cuba, Santos’s regional diplomacy shifted the region’s politics from saber rattling to the hard work of cooperation.
He turned Venezuela and Ecuador, which had long been safe havens for the FARC, into friendly neighbors willing to bring an end to the archaic tradition of revolutionary wars.
In fact, in what is perhaps the most remarkable diplomatic turnaround, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has become a key facilitator in the resolution of the Colombian conflict.
The talks with the FARC evolved as regional détente was followed by an ambitious initiative to address the root causes of the Colombian conflict.
Most notably, Santos signed the Victims and Land Restitution Law in June 2011, in the presence of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
The law provides reparation for the victims of human-rights violations in the course of a 60-year conflict, as well as restitution of millions of hectares stolen from peasants.
The law thus puts Colombia on a path to peace by blunting the FARC’s appeal to land reform to justify its untold atrocities.
The law is undeniably complex, and by no means without shortcomings.
But, if implemented as planned, it could bring about a profound social revolution.
It also represents a novel approach to peace, given that such laws are normally introduced only after a conflict has ended.
In this case, returning land to dispossessed peasants and offering financial reparation to the victims and those who were displaced by the conflict became the way to peace.
Indeed, it was none other than Alfonso Cano, a former FARC leader, who called the law “essential to a future of reconciliation” and a “contribution to a real solution to the conflict.”
Skeptics and opponents of the negotiations do have a case, however.
The FARC’s record in previous peace talks reveals a penchant for manipulating negotiations to gain national and international legitimacy without actually being willing to strike a deal.
Santos could, therefore, have been tempted to choose the Sri Lanka way – a ruthless military onslaught to defeat the insurgents, at the price of major human-rights violations and the destruction of civilian communities.
Instead, Santos opted for the path of least expedience.
After all, war, in Colombia and elsewhere, frequently unites nations, while peace divides them.
The repercussions of a genuine end to the Colombian armed conflict would be felt far beyond the country’s borders.
If Chávez’s Venezuela has become a narco-state in which the regime’s acolytes are drug lords, this reflects their privileged relations with the FARC.
Repercussions would also be felt in Mexico, where drug cartels are tearing apart the country, and the US, the world’s largest source of demand.
West Africa, too, would be affected, having become in recent years the main transit point for South American drugs headed to Europe.
Formidable difficulties still lie ahead, and a final agreement is by no means certain.
But Santos nonetheless has a fair chance of burying, once and for all, the specious mystique of violent revolutionary change that has held back Latin America’s political and economic modernization for so long.

China's Post-Olympic Challenge
NEW YORK – Almost everyone in the world who watched the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was impressed by China’s preparations, the acumen of the Chinese in running such a complex and challenging event, and the rich harvest of medals – especially gold medal – that Chinese athletes won.
It was abundantly evident in the run-up to the Games how important it was to Chinese everywhere to show themselves to advantage.
One got a sense of this when China’s reputation and the Games’ status came under attack during the Tibetan demonstrations and protests against the Olympic torch as it made its tortured progress around the world.
But, when all was said and done, through what turned out to be often Draconian controls, China pulled off quite a feat!
Indeed, it is hard to imagine that the British will care as much, or go to such extremes, for the London Olympics in 2012.
For many years, especially since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, China has felt a deficit of global respect.
This feeling has deeply troubled its leaders and filled its people with a sense that, despite all their economic progress, their proper place in the world was not only eluding them, but being denied to them by the endless criticism of the so-called “developed world.”
For the last two decades, Chinese leaders have been diligently trying to build a new edifice in order to gain some of that missing respect.
This made a successful Olympic Games, when all the world would be watching, an urgent matter.
But, now that the Games have ended, Chinese leaders cannot quite say, “Mission accomplished.”
While China’s achievement is worthy of genuine esteem, its efforts to gain a full measure of international respect and real “great power” status will not succeed until it matches its new economic and military power with a certain essential moral force.
That, in turn, requires a society and a leadership that seeks to be exemplary in all ways that make human beings more human, including respect for truthfulness, openness, tolerance, and people’s right to disagree with their government.
I fear that China’s leaders and people will continue to feel a certain gnawing, inchoate sense of deficiency and incompleteness in their quest for global respect until they find the strength to begin addressing the crucial, but elusive, issue of making China an ethical, as well as an economic and military, power.
For a country steeped in millennia of Confucianism, the need for ethical leadership should be clear.
To fully address the question of the moral and ethical base of a new form of Chinese governance, China’s government and its people must be able to look back freely and come to terms with their recent history: the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the events of 1989, Tibet, and other sensitive issues.
They must also freely be able to discuss the future and what kind of society they wish to see rise from the ashes of Mao’s revolution.
I make these somewhat critical observations about China not with any sense of moral superiority or a wish to relieve myself of the responsibility to level the same critique at my own country’s recent failures.
As most of the world knows, America’s quest to maintain its claim to the title of “greatness,” has, of late, also been elusive.
Arriving from different staring points, both the United States and China now find themselves confronting a similar challenge: restoring global trust and respect.
Their success inevitably requires directly confronting their evident moral failures.
If many of those same viewers who have been impressed by China’s successes in Beijing now also find themselves recoiling at the idea of a stronger and more prideful China, that is understandable.
For strength unalloyed by checks and balances – and by a capacity for self-critical reflection about the rightness and wrongness of state action – can be unnerving.
Many Americans, too, have recently had to learn this.
One hopes that China will derive a new measure of respect and self-confidence from these astounding Games.
But one also hopes that China’s successes will enable its leaders to feel strong enough to begin looking honestly at China’s recent past in a more critical way.
Such forthrightness is not easy for any country.
But, having completed such an important step forward, China must now find new, more humanistic ways to continue to re-invent itself.

Prosecuting Ecocide
LOS ANGELES – As floods, wildfires, record-high temperatures, and zoonotic disease make the climate and ecological crisis impossible to ignore, the world may be moving closer to agreeing that serious damage to our natural environment is more than just a matter for goodwill agreements.
It may amount to an international crime.
The last time a new international criminal offense was introduced was after World War II.
The Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters added crimes against humanity to the existing war crimes and crimes against peace (“aggression”), enshrining the idea that certain acts are so egregious that, whoever the immediate victim may be, they concern us all.
Soon after, in 1948, a particular crime against humanity – genocide – was incorporated in a new treaty.
We may be witnessing an equivalent moment in our relationship to the environment.
Last month, a diverse independent panel of international lawyers issued the draft text defining the crime of “ecocide,” to be proposed for inclusion in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The parallels are clear: adopting ecocide as an international crime acknowledges that severe damage to our environment is a crime against all of us, and that we can no longer leave it to regulation by individual states.
The panel, convened by the Stop Ecocide Foundation (on which we served), defined the crime as follows: unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts.
Two thresholds must be met for acts to constitute the crime. First, there must be a substantial likelihood that they will cause severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment.
Severity is necessary in all circumstances, and the likely damage must be either widespread (extending beyond a limited area, crossing state boundaries, or affecting an entire ecosystem or large number of people), or long-term (irreversible or irremediable through natural recovery within a reasonable period of time).
This would cover situations such as the toxic pollution of a population center – a large number of people, but a relatively limited geographical area – or the destruction of a marine ecosystem, which might be limited in size but permanently lost.
To meet the second threshold, the damage must be either “unlawful or wanton.”
Ideally, the environment would be adequately protected by national laws, and extreme violations would be international crimes. “Unlawful” deals with those situations.
But national legislation varies, and international environmental law contains few outright prohibitions.
And some legally permitted acts that harm the environment are socially desirable: consider desperately needed housing, transport, or infrastructure projects.
In such cases, international environmental law sets out principles – above all the principle of sustainable development – according to which states should behave.
The term “wanton” in the ecocide definition serves an equivalent purpose, addressing legally permitted acts that are reckless, owing to the disproportionate level of likely harm.
To be recognized as an international crime alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression, the crime of ecocide will need the support of at least two-thirds of ICC member states (currently 123 states in total). It will then become effective for any state that ratifies it.
Individuals in positions of responsibility whose actions meet the definition will be subject to prosecution at the ICC, or by any national courts with jurisdiction, and sentenced to prison if convicted.
This is a major shift from the status quo, where criminal sanctions are lacking, at the international level and often at national level too, for many of the worst cases of mass environmental destruction.
In most jurisdictions, individuals or corporations only face financial penalties.
Criminalizing ecocide could have a stronger deterrent effect than the prospect of genocide or war crimes charges do, because it is largely a corporate offense.
Because a company’s value depends heavily on its reputation and investor confidence, managers would have much to lose by finding themselves in the same dock as a war criminal (the ICC prosecutes individual offenders rather than corporations).
Even the risk of appearing to have committed an international crime may steer corporate decision-makers toward safer and more sustainable methods of operation. The hope is that the deterrent will take effect long before the law does, as the prospect of legislation becomes visible.
There are, of course, challenges to moving forward.
The ICC is already navigating difficult waters, and it is clear from developments in France that domestic ecocide legislation can be problematic (the recently enacted Climate and Resilience Act 2021 includes a much-criticized weakening of the term).
But broad international support for the crime of ecocide can and must be garnered. Governments – including those of Vanuatu, the Maldives, France, Belgium, Finland, Spain, Canada, and Luxembourg – are already expressing interest.
And parliamentary motions or draft laws have been submitted in a number of countries, including Belgium, Portugal, Brazil, France, Bolivia, Bangladesh, the United Kingdom, and Chile.
Countries must not wait for catastrophe to stop the international crime of our time.

The Rule of the Lawless
CAIRO – In one of his last essays, the late, great historian Tony Judt asked what we should have learned from the last century, a period in which so many soldiers and civilians died in conflict.
One important part of the answer, I think, is the critical importance of the rule of law, both domestically and internationally.
To be sure, there are many other things that are crucial to the good life in peaceful, open societies: freedom of speech, religion, and association, and the power to choose – and remove – your own government.
But nothing guarantees free societies' liberties as much as the application of the rule of law with equal force to the governed and the governing.
When I was a British cabinet minister and chairman of the Conservative Party, I had a legal adviser who was aptly named Mr. Maybe.
When I was taken to task for some infringement of administrative law or alleged excessive use of my legal powers, he would never be able to tell me how the courts would ultimately rule.
“Will we win this case?" I'd ask Mr. Maybe.
His reply was always conditional.
“You should win," he once said. “But I cannot promise that you will."
Authoritarian governments find this a difficult concept to understand.
I recall negotiations with my Chinese counterpart when I was Governor of Hong Kong.
I was attempting to explain why the rule of law mattered so much to the territory's future, and I noted that when I was in the British government, the law applied to me just as much as to those I helped govern.
My interlocutor thought I was joking.
What the Chinese practice is rule by law – the law as defined by the Communist Party to its own advantage.
Consider China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, for example. It is plainly being used by President Xi Jinping and his ally in the Politburo, Wang Qishan, as a tool to target not just the corrupt, but those who are not part of Xi's faction of red princelings.
In Xi's hands, the law is an instrument for securing his political objectives.
Likewise, in Russia, President Vladimir Putin rules a state apparatus designed and run by elements of the country's old intelligence services and its new mafia.
The law is used to reward the regime's cronies and to penalize its critics, such as the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the activist Alexei Navalny.
Because neither Russia nor China apply the rule of law at home, it is unsurprising that they do not recognize its value in international affairs.
Indeed, Putin has breached one of the most fundamental principles of international law: that national borders may not be changed by force.
Indeed, he has made it a regular feature of Russian foreign policy, which is characterized by deceit, bullying, violence, and the desire to restore the empire that was dismembered after the collapse of communism.
Long before Russia's armed annexation of Crimea and its invasion of eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin played similar games when it engineered the secession of Georgia's South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions and propped up the bandit territory of Transnistria in Moldova.
And, given such blatant disregard for the international order, it is no surprise that Putin's agents have been implicated in the murder of at least one opponent on the streets of London.
Building on the Geneva Conventions on the laws of war and similar binding agreements, global rules were first institutionalized with the establishment of the United Nations.
But, above all, the international framework for managing global affairs was the creation of the United States.
What was remarkable about this framework was that its principal author, the major superpower of the day, accepted its authority.
As US President Harry Truman memorably put it, “We all have to recognize – no matter how great our strength – that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please."
In times when the international system has been under assault, only America has had the standing to provide renewed credibility to the rule of law.
Unfortunately, this may no longer be the case.
During President George W. Bush's administration, the US was willfully destructive of its global interests when it disregarded international law on issues like torture.
Those US politicians who regard international institutions as anti-American conspiracies are continuing the harm, costing their country much of its moral authority.
The picture is no brighter in Europe, where countries' willful neglect of their military capabilities has undermined their ability to enforce the rule of law when international mechanisms break down.
The UN Security Council, meanwhile, has become ineffectual, stymied by the great-power interests of China and Russia.
So it does nothing, even as Europe's borders are challenged, Ukrainian citizens are bombed in their homes by Russian troops, and a violent, bandit army ravages the greater Middle East, from the beaches of Libya to the borders of Iran.
After the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s, world leaders once again solemnly declared, “Never again."
Today, Syrian, Iraqi, and now Egyptian citizens must be wondering what happened to that pledge.
In short, the growing, bloody challenges of the twenty-first century are to be confronted by a toothless UN, a morally weakened US, and a Europe well on the path toward disarmament.
If that prospect worries you, it should.
In the absence of a change of heart by our political leaders, the power of prayer may be our only recourse.

Austerity and Demoralization
NEW HAVEN – The high unemployment that we have today in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere is a tragedy, not just because of the aggregate output loss that it entails, but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society.
Austerity, according to some of its promoters, is supposed to improve morale.
British Prime Minister David Cameron, an austerity advocate, says he believes that his program reduces “welfare dependency,” restores “rigor,” and encourages the “the doers, the creators, the life-affirmers.”
Likewise, US Congressman Paul Ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote “creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.”
Some kinds of austerity programs may indeed boost morale.
Monks find their life’s meaning in a most austere environment, and military boot camps are thought to build character.
But the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion.
One could imagine that a spell of unemployment might be a time of reflection, reestablishment of personal connections, and getting back to fundamental values.
Some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point.
John Maynard Keynes, in his 1930 essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” speculated that, within a hundred years, that is, by 2030, higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours, for a total workweek of only 15 hours.
While there are still 17 years to go, it appears that Keynes was way off the mark.
So was Robert Theobald, who, in his 1963 book Free Men and Free Markets questioned the public’s repugnance toward high unemployment.
He asserted that “we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment,” and that we do not need “a whirling-dervish economy dependent on compulsive consumption.”
But finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to entail doing some sort of work: “meaningful leisure” wears thin after a while.
People seem to want to work more than three hours a day, even if it is assembly-line work.
And the opportunity to work should be a basic freedom.
Unemployment is a product of capitalism: people who are no longer needed are simply made redundant.
On the traditional family farm, there was no unemployment.
Austerity exposes the modern economy’s lack of interpersonal connectedness and the morale costs that this implies.
Work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump, thereby preserving their self-esteem.
Instead of laying off 25% of its workforce in a recession, a company could temporarily reduce workers’ hours from, say, eight per day to six.
Everyone would remain employed, and all would come a little closer to Keynes’s ideal.
Some countries, notably Germany, have encouraged this approach.
But work-sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing.
These problems preclude the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like Keynes and Theobald proclaimed.
One problem is that workers have fixed costs, such as transportation to work or a health plan, that do not decline when hours (and thus pay) are cut.
Their debts and obligations are similarly fixed.
They could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced, but now it is difficult to downsize the one that they did buy.
Another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone’s job by the same amount, because some jobs scale up and down with production, while others do not.
In his book Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession, Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs.
He found that they believed that a serious morale problem would result from reducing everyone’s hours and pay during a recession.
Then all employees would begin to feel as if they did not have a real job.
In his interviews with managers, he was told that it is best (at least from a manager’s point of view) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people, whose grumbling is not heard by the remaining employees.
Employers worry about workplace morale, not about the morale of the employees they lay off.
Their damaged morale certainly affects others as a sort of externality, which matters very much; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off.
We could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress.
But we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis.
That is why sudden austerity cannot be a morale builder.
For morale, we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone, a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort.
And for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally, the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally.
The increased tax burden for all who are employed is analogous to the reduced hours in work-sharing.
But, if tax increases are not politically expedient, policymakers should proceed with old-fashioned deficit spending.
The important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boosts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work.

The Art of Finance
PRINCETON – In the middle of September’s financial meltdown, a remarkable event occurred in London.
While the City of London was shaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the run on HBOS, Sotheby’s staged a record-breaking auction for the works of the artist Damien Hirst, which produced a gross take of around $200 million. Compared to the values that were being destroyed on Wall Street, this was small change; but it was a remarkable vote of confidence in the work of one artist.
Financial bubbles, like the one that has just definitively burst, are intimately related to the world of art.
Renaissance Florence depended on the patronage of the Medici.
Sixteenth-century Venice turned the wealth of the spice trade into the canvases of Titian and Tintoretto.
The world’s next great commercial center was Amsterdam, where again the successful burghers pushed for a new style of art and produced the age of Rembrandt.
The great nineteenth- and early twentieth-century financiers, men like J.P. Morgan, Henry Frick, and Andrew Mellon, spent a large part of their fortunes on art.
From their viewpoint, collecting art was not simply a matter of benevolence or public spiritedness. Nor was it simply a very expensive hobby.
Their galleries showed in a visible and very public way the discernment and judgment that their financial business depended on.
Financial judgment, by contrast, is not by its nature open to inspection.
It depends on inside deals, on moving ahead of the market.
It is impossible to tell who is making good bets and who is gambling recklessly.
Consequently, it is helpful to have a proxy activity that enables outsiders to see that the process of discernment and valuation really occurs.
The recent era of global finance – maybe we can already possibly speak of it as being past – differed from the financial surge of a century ago.
Its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel.
To some of its participants, collecting contemporary art showed how finance had become much more of a creative process than it was the world of the older financiers.
Morgan or Mellon collected largely old masters from the cinquecento, whose reputation was clearly and solidly established.
The new art collectors, however, were more like the Medici: they were really stimulating new cultural creation.
As with their investments, the habitués of contemporary art markets relied not purely on their own judgment, but on teams of sophisticated advisers and dealers who could give opinions on what trends best caught the spirit of the age.
Naïve outsiders found the world of contemporary art bewildering.
Why was a cow preserved in formaldehyde a great cultural achievement?
What did the sheets of cloth covered by regularly interspersed colored dots – the products of Hirst’s large and mechanized workshops – have to do with artistic innovation or originality?
But was not the same incomprehension on the part of the broad public characteristic of the increasingly sophisticated financial products that were being traded?
Indeed, the nature of the risks involved was not clear, it seems, even to regulators or the senior management of the firms that were building the business.
Some modern artists and their patrons explicitly point to the parallel between contemporary art and new financial products.
Deutsche Bank, Europe’s most prominent art-collecting bank, published the view of academic experts to the effect that customers, the broad public, were “extremely conservative, boring, lack imagination, and don’t know their own minds.”
After financial implosions, such as the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000 or the sub-prime meltdown of 2007-8, such views appear arrogant.
The parallel between bewildering and apparently meaningless art and unintelligible financial products is damning rather than reassuring.
So why was the Hirst auction such a success?
In part, because the art involved was far from being unintelligible.
The most eagerly anticipated item, a bull with golden horns and hooves, was entitled, with obvious intent, “The Golden Calf.”
But there was also another motive driving the bidders.
One hint was that Russian buyers paid the big money, at the very moment that Russia’s banking system was melting down.
At the same time, there was a surge in demand for gold jewelry.
The search for non-financial assets looks like characteristic behavior in any financial crisis – what was known during the great drama of hyperinflation in Weimar Germany as “die Flucht in die Sachwerte,” the flight to material assets.
Art also functions as a store of value.
But in order to be sure of the reliability of this function, the purchaser must be convinced of the long-term valuation of the object of desire.
The bankers of the Italian Renaissance also bought works of art because they reminded them of timeless values that transcended quotidian transactions.
They saw their acquisitions of paintings and sculptures as a connection to eternity.
Who can say the same for the products of Damien Hirst?

A Radioactive Bank to be Welcomed
CANBERRA – One of the many things the world has learned from the Iran nuclear saga is that its leaders made a mistake, when negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the 1960s, in not doing anything to constrain uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing.
This failure apparently stemmed from the belief – long since proven wrong, certainly in the case of uranium – that the only states ever likely to possess that technical capability already possessed nuclear weapons, or (like Germany) were totally committed never to acquire them.
As a result, any member state can argue for its “inalienable right” under the NPT to pursue any stage of the nuclear fuel cycle. Although any such right extends only to activities for “peaceful purposes,” the loophole is gaping.
Any technically capable state – and there are now dozens of them – can build uranium enrichment facilities with the official purpose of producing fuel for nuclear power or research reactors, but which are nonetheless inherently capable of producing the much higher-grade fuel needed for nuclear weapons.
It is not for nothing that such facilities have been described as “bomb starter kits,” and that Iran’s progress down that path – whether deliberately designed to give it a latent weapons breakout capability or not – has spooked so many others in the international community.
That is why there was so much pressure to produce the deal now on the table, which dramatically limits Iran’s enrichment capability.
While renegotiating the NPT itself to close the enrichment loophole seems for now a lost cause, there are other ways to address this proliferation risk.
One of the most important, and long-advocated, strategies is to demonstrate to countries that rely on nuclear power, or are planning to develop it, that they do not need their own uranium-enrichment program to ensure their fuel supply’s security.
Concern about fuel-supply security has always been Iran’s main publicly stated justification for acquiring its enrichment capability – a justification that its critics assert was manufactured simply to conceal a covert weapons agenda.
Whether or not that is the case, all current and would-be nuclear power producers are entitled to be anxious about having an absolutely assured fuel supply, given the major economic and social consequences they would face in the event of a disruption.
Yes, until now, the commercial nuclear-fuel market has worked well: no power reactor has had to shut down because of fuel-supply disruptions.
But the cut-off of the supply of other energy resources (notably Russia’s disruption of natural-gas supplies to Ukraine and, by extension, to Western Europe) has raised legitimate concerns about whether this could happen with nuclear fuel.
Although the issue has been much debated, until now there has been only modest progress in developing fuel-supply assurance arrangements that would meet this concern.
Russia, with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), maintains a sizeable reserve of low-enriched uranium (LEU) at its international center in Angarsk; but, in the current security environment, there has been understandable international reluctance to rely on it.
The United Kingdom has proposed a supply guarantee of its own, though it has so far attracted little attention.
Now, in an important new development, to be officially launched this month (on August 27), Kazakhstan is establishing a major new international fuel bank, which it will operate on behalf of the IAEA.
The new facility should once and for all remove the main excuse that has been advanced, sincerely or not, for building and maintaining homegrown enrichment capability.
Scheduled to commence operations in 2017, the Kazakh fuel bank will store up to 90 tons of LEU, sufficient to refuel three typical power-producing light water reactors.
While Kazakhstan will physically operate the bank, the uranium will be owned and controlled by the IAEA, and made available to non-nuclear-weapon states if, for any reason, they cannot secure the LEU they need from the commercial market.
Provided the state in question is in compliance with its comprehensive non-proliferation safeguards agreement with the IAEA, it can draw the required fuel from the bank and transfer it to a fuel fabricator to make fuel assemblies for the reactors involved.
The Kazakh fuel bank has very wide and high-level international backing, helped by the country’s credentials.
A former nuclear test-site state, Kazakhstan willingly gave up the nuclear weapons on its territory when the opportunity arose with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and it has been a strong and consistent advocate of nuclear arms control and disarmament ever since.
The bank has been funded by voluntary contributions, including $50 million from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a United States-based NGO, $49 million from the US government, up to $25 million from the European Union, $10 million each from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and $5 million from Norway.
Aside from the Iran deal, good news on nuclear weapons has been sparse in recent years.
The new Kazakh fuel bank is a significant step toward achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.
Those who have worked to establish it deserve the world’s gratitude.

International Norms in Cyberspace
CAMBRIDGE – Last month, the Netherlands hosted the Global Conference on Cyberspace 2015, which brought together nearly 2,000 government officials, academics, industry representatives, and others. I chaired a panel on cyber peace and security that included a Microsoft vice president and two foreign ministers.
This “multi-stakeholder” conference was the latest in a series of efforts to establish rules of the road to avoid cyber conflict.
The capacity to use the Internet to inflict damage is now well established.
Many observers believe the American and Israeli governments were behind an earlier attack that destroyed centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility.
Some say an Iranian government attack destroyed thousands of Saudi Aramco computers.
Russia is blamed for denial-of-service attacks on Estonia and Georgia.
And just last December, US President Barack Obama attributed an attack on Sony Pictures to the North Korean government.
Until recently, cyber security was largely the domain of a small community of computer experts.
When the Internet was created in the 1970s, its members formed a virtual village; everyone knew one another, and together they designed an open system, paying little attention to security.
Then, in the early 1990s, the World Wide Web emerged, growing from a few million users then to more than three billion today.
In little more than a generation, the Internet has become the substrate of the global economy and governance worldwide.
Several billion more human users will be added in the next decade, as will tens of billions of devices, ranging from thermostats to industrial control systems (the “Internet of Things”).
All of this burgeoning interdependence implies vulnerabilities that governments and non-governmental actors can exploit.
At the same time, we are only beginning to come to terms with the national-security implications of this.
Strategic studies of the cyber domain resemble nuclear strategy in the 1950s: analysts are still not clear about the meaning of offense, defense, deterrence, escalation, norms, and arms control.
The term “cyber war” is used very loosely for a wide range of behaviors, ranging from simple probes, website defacement, and denial of service to espionage and destruction.
In this, it reflects dictionary definitions of “war,” which include any organized effort to “stop or defeat something that is viewed as dangerous or bad” (for example, “war on drugs”).
A more useful definition of cyber war is any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent in effect to major physical violence.
Determining whether an action meets that criterion is a decision that only a country’s political leaders can make.
There are four major categories of cyber threats to national security, each with a different time horizon and (in principle) different solutions: cyber war and economic espionage, which are largely associated with states, and cyber crime and cyber terrorism, which are mostly associated with non-state actors.
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime, but the other two may become greater threats over the next decade than they are today. Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap.
During the Cold War, ideological competition limited US-Soviet cooperation, but both sides’ awareness of nuclear destructiveness led them to develop a crude code of conduct to avoid military confrontation. These basic rules of prudence included no direct fighting, no first use of nuclear weapons, and crisis communication, such as the Moscow-Washington hotline and the Accidents Measures and Incidents at Sea agreements.
The first formal arms-control agreement was the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, which can be considered mainly an environmental treaty.
The second major agreement was the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aimed at limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.
The US and the Soviet Union perceived both agreements as positive-sum games, because they involved nature or third parties.
Similarly, the most promising areas for early international cooperation on securing cyberspace are problems posed by third parties such as criminals and terrorists.
Russia and China have sought a treaty for broad United Nations oversight of the Internet. Though their vision of “information security” could legitimize authoritarian governments’ censorship, and is therefore unacceptable to democratic governments, it may be possible to identify and target behaviors that are illegal everywhere.
Limiting all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism.
Major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls.
Of course, historical analogies are imperfect.
Obviously, cyber technology is very different from nuclear technology, particularly because non-governmental actors can exploit it much more easily.
Nonetheless, some institutions, both formal and informal, already govern the basic functioning of the Internet.
The US wisely plans to strengthen the non-governmental Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) by having it supervise the Internet “address book.” There is also the Council of Europe’s 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, with Interpol and Europol facilitating cooperation among national police forces.
And a UN Group of Government Experts has been analyzing how international law relates to cyber security.
It is likely to take longer to conclude agreements on contentious issues such as cyber intrusions for purposes like espionage and preparing the battlefield.
Nonetheless, the inability to envisage an overall cyber arms-control agreement need not prevent progress on some issues now.
International norms tend to develop slowly.
It took two decades in the case of nuclear technology.
The most important message of the recent Dutch conference was that massive cyber vulnerability is now nearing that point.

Putting a Price on Rainforests
NEW YORK – In early October, shortly after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that his company could, given the opportunity, rebuild the island’s electrical grid using solar power.
Coming in the midst of so much human suffering, it was a bold claim.
But from a technological perspective, the timing was perfect.
By late October, solar panels and high-capacity batteries had been installed at San Juan’s Hospital del Niño, and additional projects are in the works.
This type of response to a natural disaster – replacing a fossil-fuel-reliant power grid with renewable energy – should be applauded.
But no matter how clean and efficient renewable energy sources may be, they will never fully mitigate the climatic effects that are bringing more hurricanes like Maria ashore.
There is another way to do that, and it is far cheaper than what Musk has proposed.
Puerto Rico is home to one of the most efficient and inexpensive tools available in the fight against climate change: rainforests.
On the island’s eastern tip, the nearly 29,000-acre El Yunque National Forest is one of the Caribbean’s most important systems for capturing and storing carbon.
Maria destroyed the forest, too.
But tech CEOs have not tweeted about restoring that resource, because, at the moment, they see no viable business model for saving trees.
But what if such a model did exist?
What if there were ways to make tropical forests worth more alive than dead?
Global leaders have been pondering this question for years.
And, at UN climate talks, they have come up with a novel solution: an initiative called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The idea is simple: with the right incentives, people, governments, and industries will preserve and restore tropical forests, rather than plow them under.
In return, the world gets more carbon sinks to soak up greenhouse gasses.
REDD+, which has been around in various forms for nearly a decade, provides a payment structure for preservation and restoration efforts.
By putting an economic value on forests for the role they play in large-scale carbon capture and storage, REDD+ allows standing trees to compete with lucrative land uses – such as logging or agriculture – that result in deforestation.
The first large-scale REDD+ program, an agreement between Norway and Brazil, was initiated in 2008.
Norway agreed to provide $1 billion in “performance-based payments” to Brazil for successfully protecting its rainforests.
The money from Norway was released in installments, as Brazil conserved its forests.
The results were impressive: Brazil reduced the average rate of Amazon deforestation by over 60% over the last decade, absorbing about 3.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide, more than any other country.
And Norway was able to help mitigate global carbon dioxide emissions.
But, despite the success of the pilot partnership, the REDD+ program today is in dire need of capital.
In many ways, the solution is similar to Musk’s solar proposal in Puerto Rico.
Only this time, the innovation is not technical, but financial.
Creating a market for REDD+ credits would create investment opportunities in tropical forest preservation for heavily polluting companies and industries.
With an adequate policy framework, REDD+ credits could be offered through existing compliance markets – such as the carbon credit markets in California or South Korea – unlocking billions in additional capital for reforestation efforts.
Developing such a framework would also enable REDD+ to become part of future compliance systems, like the one being developed by the global airline industry to cap emissions, or the carbon-permit market that China plans to launch later this year.
Integration into these markets could also tap new funding streams for forest conservation and reforestation, as it would allow financial intermediaries, like the REDD+ Acceleration Fund, to connect REDD+ projects directly with the private sector.
At the moment, most of this is aspirational.
REDD+ is merely a set of guidelines, and a forest credit market will require rules and standards to govern how protection and reforestation allowances are allocated to buyers and integrated into current markets. Global leaders gathering this week for the UN climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, can aid these efforts by continuing to support the development of effective and transparent accounting mechanisms for REDD+ projects.
There is danger in delay.
In the two years since the Paris climate agreement was adopted, deforestation increased sharply in Indonesia and parts of the Amazon, where much of the world’s largest and most vital tropical forests stand.
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, tropical deforestation is responsible for three billion tons of additional atmospheric CO2 annually – more than the world’s entire transportation sector.
No technology is as effective at storing carbon as tropical forests, and saving and restoring them offers one of the cheapest large-scale forms of emissions abatement or capture, while providing a host of other environmental and social benefits.
To take advantage of this crucial hedge against a warming planet, more trees must remain standing.
For those of us who believe that a forest credit market could provide critical means of protecting our planet our Musk moment is here.
We must be similarly bold.

Housing versus Habitat
CAMBRIDGE – Peter Drucker, the influential management guru, famously said, “What does not get measured, does not get done.”
He might have added that what gets measured poorly gets done poorly.
Consider low-income housing.
Most developing countries, and many rich ones, define their housing deficit according to the number of families living in units deemed socially unacceptable.
But what is meant by unacceptable varies greatly from country to country.
Piped water, sewerage, and electricity are seen as essential in the Americas, but not in India.
The problem is that people do not demand houses; they demand habitats.
A house is an object; a habitat is a node in a multiplicity of overlapping networks – physical (power, water and sanitation, roads), economic (urban transport, labor markets, distribution and retail, entertainment) and social (education, health, security, family, friends).
The ability to connect to all of these networks makes a habitat valuable.
Cities, for example, can be highly productive spaces, because they allow people to combine their different skills to make things that none of them could make individually.
People can exchange their knowhow, learn from each other, and trade.
Jane Jacobs’s insights on this, published more that 40 years ago, have been confirmed by more recent studies summarized in books by Edward Glaeser and Enrico Moretti.
So, if the deficit being measured is one of houses rather than one of habitats, the solutions often do not solve the real problem.
A housing minister who is told to build a certain number of houses will likely fail to build an equivalent number of well-connected habitat nodes.
After all, much of what makes a house a habitat lies outside of his department’s purview.
Moreover, if the housing deficit is diagnosed as a dearth of adequate housing, then the solution is to build more houses for those who lack it – that is, the poor.
But this is like assuming that new cars should be built for those without them – that is, for people who could buy second-hand cars from those seeking to upgrade.
It confuses the construction industry, which builds new homes, with the much larger housing market, which includes all homes.
It gets worse.
Because the poor cannot buy adequate housing on their own, public resources must be used.
In order to target these subsidies to low-income households, governments typically treat families of different income levels differently: the rich must fend for themselves, middle-class families are provided with assistance to secure mortgage loans, and the poor are offered public housing. To maximize the number of units built, housing ministries make sure that projects meet minimum specifications below a certain per-unit cost threshold.
As a result, developers look for the cheapest land, which is obviously the least connected to the networks that would make it more valuable.
This approach has ended up exacerbating the segregation of the poor.
It artificially creates – as in France – socially homogenous poor neighborhoods where the unskilled live among themselves, disconnected from others, making it harder for them to benefit from the agglomeration economies that would boost their productivity.
Indeed, because many of these developments are so remote, residents often face a long, uncomfortable, and costly daily commute to reach good jobs.
No wonder so many prefer to stay home and work on their own, which may explain why so many developing countries are becoming more urbanized but not more productive.
Confusing the construction of new homes with the housing market is most absurd when dealing with displaced families.
For example, the Venezuelan and Colombian governments were confronted with the need to relocate tens of thousands of families displaced by floods in 2010.
Although the two governments are far apart politically, both promised the displaced families new houses in new urban developments.
In the meantime, people were left for years waiting in shelters.
And, once again, these new urban developments have few of the networks that would make them a habitat.
The burden of creating integrated communities has been placed on a randomly assembled group comprising some of the least connected members of society.
Instead, displaced families should quickly be given vouchers so that they can obtain an appropriate home without delay.
They are bound to choose older homes in established neighborhoods that have already been connected to the many networks that make them a habitat.
Large new housing developments should naturally attract those who already have ample social connections, making it easier to kick-start more integrated communities.
In order to separate the problem of the overall housing deficit from the problem of families with inadequate housing, policymakers need to address both supply and demand.
On the supply side, urban land – with all its physical and social infrastructure – must expand quickly enough.
On the demand side, subsidies should focus on helping families choose from the entire housing market.
This approach would promote socially diverse and productive neighborhoods, rather than segregation and pockets of economic stagnation.
But this goal cannot be achieved unless the construction industry is prevented from dictating low-income-housing policy.

The Trade Wars of Codependency
NEW HAVEN – Codependency never ends well in personal relationships.
Judging by the ever-escalating trade war between the United States and China, the same is true of economic relationships.
While I published a book in 2014 on the codependent economic relationship between the US and China, I would be the first to concede that it is a stretch to generalize insights from human psychology to assess the behavior of national economies.
But the similarities are striking, and the prognosis all the more compelling, as the world’s two largest economies sink into a dangerous quagmire.
In its most basic terms, codependency occurs at one of the extremes of relationship dynamics – when two partners draw more from each other than from their own inner strength.
This is not a stable condition.
Codependency deepens as partner feedback tends to grow in importance and self-confidence steadily diminishes as a result.
The relationship becomes highly reactive and fraught, with mounting tensions.
Invariably, one partner hits a limit and seeks a new source of sustenance.
This leaves the other feeling scorned, steeped in denial and blame, and ultimately with a vindictive urge to lash out in response.
The case for US-China economic codependency has been compelling for many years.
On the brink of collapse in the late 1970s, following the cumulative convulsions of Mao’s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, China was quick to turn to the US for external support for Deng Xiaoping’s strategy of “reform and opening up.”
Meanwhile, the US, in the grips of stagflation in the late 1970s, was eager to seek new growth solutions; low-cost Chinese imports were the antidote for income-constrained American consumers.
The US also began to borrow freely from China’s vast reservoir of surplus saving – a convenient solution for the world’s largest deficit saver.
Born out of innocence, this two-way dependency blossomed into a seemingly blissful marriage of convenience.
Alas, it was not a loving relationship.
Deep-seated biases and resentments – China’s so-called century of humiliation following the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century and America’s inability to get out of its own skin when assessing the ideological threat posed by a socialist state like China – sustained a long-simmering distrust that set the stage for the current conflict.
As the human pathology of codependency would predict, a parting of the ways eventually occurred.
China was the first to embrace change – committing to an economic rebalancing by shifting its growth model from external to internal demand, from exports and investment to private consumption. China’s progress has been mixed, but the endgame is no longer in doubt, underscored by a shift from surplus saving to saving absorption.
After peaking at 52.3% in 2008, its gross domestic saving rate has fallen approximately seven percentage points and should continue to decline in the years ahead as China strengthens its long-porous social safety net, encouraging Chinese families to reduce fear-driven precautionary saving.
At the same time, an explosion of e-commerce in an increasingly digitized (that is, cashless) economy is providing a powerful platform for China’s emerging middle-class consumers.
And a transformation from imported to indigenous innovation is central to China’s long-term strategy, both to avoid the “middle-income trap” and to achieve great-power status by 2050, as per President Xi Jinping’s “new era” centenary aspirations.
Consistent with the human pathology of codependency, China’s shifts have become a source of growing discomfort for the US, which can hardly be thrilled with China’s saving pivot. With America’s saving shortfall now worsening in the aftermath of last year’s poorly timed tax cuts, the US will only become more reliant on surplus savers like China to fill the void.
Yet China’s move to saving absorption narrows that option.
Moreover, while China’s nascent consumer-led growth dynamic is impressive by most standards, limited market access has constrained US companies from capturing what they judge to be a fair market share of the potential bonanza.
And, of course, there is enormous controversy over the innovation shift, which may well lie at the heart of the current tariff war.
Whatever the source, the conflict phase of codependency is now at hand. China is changing, or at least attempting to do so, while America is not.
The US remains stuck in the time-worn mindset of a deficit saver with massive multilateral trade deficits and the need to draw freely on global surplus saving to support economic growth.
From the perspective of codependency, the US now feels scorned by its once compliant partner and, predictably, is lashing out in response.
Which brings us to the burning question: Will the US-China trade conflict end with a peaceful resolution or an acrimonious divorce?
The lessons from human behavior may hold the answer.
Rather than react out of blame, scorn, and distrust, both countries need to focus on rebuilding their own economic strength from within.
That will require compromises on both sides – not just on the trade front, but also on the core economic strategies that both nations embrace.
The innovation dilemma is the most contentious issue by far.
The conflict phase of codependency frames it as a zero-sum battle: US allegations of Chinese intellectual property theft are portrayed by the Trump administration as nothing less than an existential threat to America’s economic future.
Yet, seen as a classic symptom of codependency, those fears are overblown.
Innovation is indeed the lifeblood of any country’s sustained prosperity.
But it need not be depicted as a zero-sum battle.
China needs to shift from imported to indigenous innovation to avoid the middle-income trap – a key stumbling block for most developing economies.
The US needs to refocus on innovation to overcome yet another worrisome productivity slowdown that could lead to a corrosive stagnation.
That may well be the bottom line on the trade conflicts of codependency.
The US and China both need innovation-led economies for their own purposes – in codependency terms, for their own personal growth.
Transforming a zero-sum conflict of codependency into a positive-sum relationship of mutually beneficial interdependence is the only way to end this economic war before it turns into something far worse.

The Threat of German Amnesia
BERLIN – Europe’s situation is serious – very serious.
Who would have thought that British Prime Minister David Cameron would call on eurozone governments to muster the courage to create a fiscal union (with a common budget and tax policy and jointly guaranteed public debt)?
And Cameron also argues that deeper political integration is the only way to stop the breakup of the euro.
A conservative British prime minister!
The European house is ablaze, and Downing Street is calling for a rational and resolute response by the fire brigade.
Unfortunately, the fire brigade is being led by Germany, and its chief is Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As a result, Europe continues to try to quench the fire with gasoline – German-enforced austerity – with the consequence that, in a mere three years, the eurozone’s financial crisis has become a European existential crisis.
Let’s not delude ourselves: if the euro falls apart, so will the European Union (the world’s largest economy), triggering a global economic crisis on a scale that most people alive today have never experienced.
Europe is on the edge of an abyss, and will surely tumble into it unless Germany – and France – alters course.
The recent elections in France and Greece, together with local elections in Italy and continuing unrest in Spain and Ireland, have shown that the public has lost faith in the strict austerity forced upon them by Germany.
Merkel’s kill-to-cure remedy has run up against reality – and democracy.
We are once again learning the hard way that this kind of austerity, when applied in the teeth of a major financial crisis, leads only to depression.
This insight should have been common knowledge; it was, after all, a major lesson of the austerity policies of President Herbert Hoover in the United States and Chancellor Heinrich Brüning in Weimar Germany in the early 1930’s.
Unfortunately, Germany, of all countries, seems to have forgotten it.
As a consequence, chaos looms in Greece, as does the prospect of subsequent bank runs in Spain, Italy, and France – and thus a financial avalanche that would bury Europe.
And then?
Should we write off what more than two generations of Europeans have created – a massive investment in institution-building that has led to the longest period of peace and prosperity in the history of the continent?
One thing is certain: a breakup of the euro and the EU would entail Europe’s exit from the world stage.
Germany’s current policy is all the more absurd in view of the bitter political and economic consequences that it would face.
It is up to Germany and France, Merkel and President François Hollande, to decide the future of our continent.
Europe’s salvation now depends on a fundamental change in Germany’s economic-policy stance, and in France’s position on political integration and structural reforms.
France will have to say yes to a political union: a common government with common parliamentary control for the eurozone.
The eurozone’s national governments already are acting in unison as a de facto government to address the crisis.
What is becoming increasingly true in practice should be carried forward and formalized.
Germany, for its part, will have to opt for a fiscal union.
Ultimately, that means guaranteeing the eurozone’s survival with Germany’s economic might and assets: unlimited acquisition of the crisis countries’ government bonds by the European Central Bank, Europeanization of national debts via Eurobonds, and growth programs to avoid a eurozone depression and boost recovery.
One can easily imagine the ranting in Germany about this kind of program: still more debt!
Loss of control over our assets!
Inflation!
It just doesn’t work!
But it does work: Germany’s export-led growth is based on just such programs in the emerging countries and the US.
If China and America had not pumped partly debt-financed money into their economies beginning in 2009, the German economy would have taken a serious hit.
Germans must now ask themselves whether they, who have profited the most from European integration, are willing to pay the price for it or would prefer to let it fail.
Beyond political and fiscal unification and short-term growth policies, Europeans urgently need structural reforms aimed at restoring Europe’s competitiveness.
Each of these pillars is needed if Europe is to overcome its existential crisis.
Do we Germans understand our pan-European responsibility?
It certainly does not look that way.
Indeed, rarely has Germany been as isolated as it is now.
Hardly anyone understands our dogmatic austerity policy, which goes against all experience, and we are considered largely off-course, if not heading into oncoming traffic.
It is still not too late to change direction, but now we have only days and weeks, perhaps months, rather than years.
Germany destroyed itself – and the European order – twice in the twentieth century, and then convinced the West that it had drawn the right conclusions.
Only in this manner – reflected most vividly in its embrace of the European project – did Germany win consent for its reunification.
It would be both tragic and ironic if a restored Germany, by peaceful means and with the best of intentions, brought about the ruin of the European order a third time.

Trump’s Brain Drain
WASHINGTON, DC – America’s high-quality universities are among the key sources of its greatness.
Every year, top students from all over the world vie for access to graduate and undergraduate programs in the US, and American universities occupy most of the top spots in global rankings.
Moreover, the basic research conducted at US universities has been a primary driver of innovation and economic growth, as well as the source of a disproportionate share of Nobel prizes.
America’s universities cater to a wide variety of students, researchers, and other economic actors.
The top research universities attract not just the best and the brightest students, but also clusters of high-tech companies, such as those in Silicon Valley and Boston.
At the same time, public and private universities across the country offer excellent programs for four-year degrees. And community colleges provide vocational training as well as a pathway to a four-year degree for countless other high-school graduates.
With competition between public and private institutions ensuring a high level of excellence across the board, higher education in the US has long been a major export industry. According to Catherine Rampell of the Washington Post, US “educational exports are about as big as [US] total exports of soybeans, coal and natural gas combined.”
With three times more foreign students studying in the US than Americans studying abroad, the US higher-education sector contributed a net surplus of around $34 billion to the US current account in 2017.
Foreign students’ attendance at US universities confers many advantages.
For starters, these students usually pay full tuition rates (especially at the undergraduate level), which allows universities to allocate more financial aid for Americans who need it.
At the graduate level, more than half of those enrolled in computer-science and engineering programs are foreign-born and could remain in the US to work. Without them, America’s high-tech companies would face an even greater talent shortage than they already do.
Finally, the presence of foreign students enriches the university experience for Americans themselves.
And, as an added soft-power bonus, many foreign students return home as staunch supporters of America, and can influence their country’s foreign-policy positions accordingly.
Until 2016, the number of foreign students studying in the US had been rising, but it then fell by around 3% in 2016, and by 6.6% in 2017.
And initial reports indicate that it dropped by another 7% in 2018.
Part of this decline is probably due to the fact that other countries have recognized the importance of hosting top-quality universities, and are working harder to attract foreign students and retain their own.
But another important factor is US President Donald Trump’s administration.
Since Trump’s inauguration, it has become harder to obtain a student visa, and foreign students already enrolled in US universities have had to worry about whether they will be able to travel to and from their home country.
The unwelcoming atmosphere – epitomized by Trump’s notorious travel ban – is deterring a growing number of first-rate students from pursuing higher education in the US.
To be sure, there are also problems within the US higher-education sector itself.
Complaints about rising tuition and fees, for example, have been building for years.
What is often forgotten, though, is that the knowledge one gains from leading universities has also become more valuable, particularly in fields such as biochemistry, computer science, and environmental studies.
And even in other fields, innovations such as big data have vastly enhanced our understanding and broadened the scope of practical applications in areas such as business, medicine, and public policy.
Put another way, one rarely hears complaints about the price of a Tesla compared to that of a Ford, or about the price of a Ford today compared to that of a Model T in the 1920s.
Insofar as tuition costs have risen, a large part of it is almost certainly due to advances in knowledge, and thus the quality of a four-year degree.
Just as a car today is more valuable than one from 100 years ago, so, too, is a four-year degree.
Of course, even as knowledge has increased, so have other costs.
According to a study of 13 US colleges and universities by the Boston Consulting Group, “regulatory compliance represents 3 to 11 percent of higher education institutions’ nonhospital operating expenses.”
And with the emergence of new cutting-edge fields and high-paid opportunities in the private sector, the costs of attracting and retaining faculty have also risen.
As a partial solution, colleges and universities have increased their financial aid to offset the “sticker price” (full tuition charges) for more students.
In fact, some universities now spend as much as half of their budgets on financial aid. But, again, the more foreign students there are to pay full tuition, the smaller this burden will be.
For all of his complaints about the US trade deficit, Trump is shooting himself in the foot by ordering his administration to tighten visa requirements and thereby undercutting exports of US higher-education services, as well as harming higher education itself.
With other countries attempting to beef up their own universities, the US should be increasing its efforts to attract foreign students.
Doing so would cost the US nothing, attract the talent its economy needs, and make higher education more affordable for more Americans.

China’s Search for Quality Growth
HONG KONG – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his second five-year term, shifting toward “quality growth” is at the top of the country’s policy agenda.
Across China’s government, a quiet but resolute commitment to fostering a new growth model that corrects the distortions created by decades of double-digit growth – including corruption, pollution, rising inequality, and other structural imbalances – is taking root.
Over most of the last 40 years, China focused on rapid land-based development, driven by local initiatives aimed at attracting infrastructure investment, human resources, and tax revenues. The creation of special economic zones, industrial parks, and free-trade zones facilitated such development, as they benefited from a large pool of cheap labor migrating from rural areas.
Throughout this process, China used GDP growth as its main measure of success.
This enabled the establishment of well-defined goals and incentives for local officials as they competed with one another.
But it also caused serious problems – such as environmental damage, inequality, excessive debts, overcapacity, and corruption – to flourish.
Today, China’s authorities are looking at a broader range of measures at the local and national levels that cover not just growth, but also quality of life.
The vision behind this shift was articulated at the Communist Party of China’s 19th National Congress last October, when Xi stressed 14 policy areas that would be critical to develop “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
Among those imperatives was “adopting a new vision for development,” which “ensures and improves living standards.”
This vision should be underpinned by a commitment to a “people-centered approach” and “harmony between human and nature.”
Xi also emphasized strong governance, specifically “ensuring Party leadership over all work,” “ensuring every dimension of governance is law-based,” and “exercising full and rigorous governance over the Party.”
The motivation behind the shift in China’s development focus is no mystery.
China is now the world’s second-largest economy and accounts for nearly half of global growth.
It has now largely caught up with the advanced countries in terms of infrastructure, trade, investment, and industrialization.
Continuing to strengthen its position on the world stage is now a matter of meeting and even exceeding global standards in areas ranging from sustainability to good governance.
Of course, addressing the challenges China faces will require plenty of trial and error – much like that which enabled its past development – not to mention acceptance of some economic casualties. For example, the decline of the industrial areas in northeast China and the rise of modern, globally competitive manufacturing clusters in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas in southeast China are two sides of the same coin.
Market competition in China created both winners and losers, with the winners in the southeast taking entrepreneurs, talent, and other resources from the losers in the northeast.
Managing the transformation of China’s regional economies while preserving social stability will demand a careful balance between the old growth strategy exemplified by the losers, which relied heavily on state-owned enterprises and public investment, and the new, more human-capital-oriented approach being developed by the winners. In the process, China will need to take into account local factors, such as population trends, natural resources, and regions’ appeal to middle-income domestic tourists.
This rebalancing will require the central government to help relieve the debt burdens resulting from bankrupt projects in the losing regions, much like it did in the 1990s, when it wrote off the losses that SOEs incurred during the Asian financial crisis.
This does not mean that China should rescue outdated local industries.
Rather, it means preventing the sunk costs of China’s past growth model from leaving entire regions trapped in low-quality growth and development, by enabling local people to develop innovative start-ups, while investing in projects that create new income opportunities.
Beyond supply-side structural adjustments, China must ensure that its new growth strategy addresses “last mile” demand-side problems of urban and human development, including traffic jams, infrastructure bottlenecks, housing shortages, underdeveloped waste-management services, and inadequate education and health care. As it stands, resolving these micro-level issues – critical to human wellbeing – is among the weakest areas of China’s complex macroeconomic and social reform plans.
China has all the physical, financial, and social resources it needs to redress these problems, which in fact amount to major investment opportunities for both the public and private sectors.
But, to succeed, any strategy must not only account for local feedback about what is achievable under local conditions; it must also allow for local ownership of solutions, including design and implementation.
In any case, China’s leaders have demonstrated a willingness and ability to look at the big picture, accepting lower rates of GDP growth as they rebalance the country’s development model and pursue improvements in quality of life.
It will not be easy to realize the vision of “people-centered development” that Xi announced last October.
But China is on the right track.

Does the UN Still Matter?
With 192 members and a mandate that covers everything from security to refugees to public health, the United Nations is the world’s only global organization. But polls in the United States show that two-thirds of Americans think the UN is doing a poor job, and many believe it was tarnished by corruption during the Iraq oil-for-food program under Saddam Hussein.
Many also blame the UN for failing to solve the Middle East’s myriad problems.
But such views reflect a misunderstanding of the UN’s nature.
The UN is more an instrument of its member states than an independent actor in world politics.
True, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon can make speeches, convene meetings, and propose actions, but his role is more secretary than general.
Sometimes likened to a “secular Pope,” the UN Secretary General can wield the soft power of persuasion but little hard economic or military power.
What hard power the UN has must be begged and borrowed from the member states.
And when they cannot agree on a course of action, it is difficult for the organization to operate.
As one wag has put it, “We have met the UN and it is us!”
When blame is assigned, much of it belongs to the members.
Consider the oil for food program, which was designed by member states to provide relief to Iraqis hurt by sanctions against Saddam’s regime. The secretariat did an inadequate job of monitoring the program and some corruption was involved.
But the much larger sums that Saddam diverted for his own purposes reflected how the member governments designed the program, and they chose to turn a blind eye to the abuse.
Yet the program’s problems are portrayed in the press as “the UN’s fault.
The cost of the entire UN system is about $20 billion, or less than the annual bonuses paid out in a good year on Wall Street.
Of that sum, the secretariat in New York accounts for a mere 10%.
Some universities have larger budgets.
Another $7 billion supports UN peacekeeping forces in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lebanon, Haiti, and the Balkans.
The rest – more than half – is spent by the UN’s specialized agencies, which are located around the world and often play an important role in managing global trade, development, health, and humanitarian assistance.
For example, the UN High Commission for Refugees helps to alleviate the problems of displaced persons, the World Food Program provides assistance to malnourished children, and the World Health Organization supports the public health information systems that are crucial for dealing with threats from pandemics like avian flu.
The UN does not have the resources to solve the problems in new areas like AIDS or global climate change, but it can play an important convening role in galvanizing the actions of governments.
Even in the area of security, the UN retains an important role.
The original 1945 concept of collective security, by which states would band together to deter and punish aggressors, failed because the Soviet Union and the West were at loggerheads during the Cold War.
For a brief moment after a broad coalition of countries acted together to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991, it looked like the original concept of collective security would become “a new world order.”
Such hopes were short-lived.
Consensus within the UN proved unachievable on both Kosovo in 1999 and Iraq in 2003.
Skeptics concluded that the UN had become irrelevant for security questions.
Yet in 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah fought to a stalemate in Lebanon, states were only too happy to turn to a UN peacekeeping force.
Ironically, peacekeeping was not specified in the original charter.
It was invented by the second Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, and Canadian Foreign Minister Lester Pearson after Britain and France invaded Egypt in the Suez crisis of 1956.
Since then, UN peacekeeping forces have been deployed more than 60 times.
There are now roughly 100,000 troops from various countries wearing UN blue helmets around the world.
Peacekeeping has had its ups and downs.
Bosnia and Rwanda were failures in the 1990’s, and then Secretary General Kofi Annan proposed reforms to deal with genocide and mass killings.
In September 2005, the states in the UN General Assembly accepted the existence of a “responsibility to protect” vulnerable peoples.
In other words, governments could no longer treat their citizens however they wanted.
A new Peace-building Commission was also created to coordinate actions that could help prevent a recurrence of genocidal acts.
In East Timor, for example, the UN proved vital in the transition to independence, and it is now working out plans for the governments of Burundi and Sierra Leone.
In the DRC, peacekeeping forces have not been able to curb all violence, but they have helped to save lives.
The current test case is the situation in Sudan’s Darfur region, where diplomats are trying to establish a joint peacekeeping force under the UN and the African Union.
In the poisonous political atmosphere that has bedeviled the UN after the Iraq War, widespread disillusionment is not surprising.
Ban Ki Moon has a tough job.
But, rather than calling the UN into question, states are likely to find that they need such a global instrument, with its unique convening and legitimizing powers.
While the UN system is far from perfect, the world would be a poorer and more disorderly place without it.

Realizing the Promise of African Health Care
NAIROBI – The quality and accessibility of health care have long been known to have a disproportionate impact on the economic and emotional wellbeing of entire societies. The 54 countries that make up the continent of Africa are no different.
Like many of their emerging-market peers, these countries have been plagued by a combination of high disease rates and insufficient resources to tackle the health burden.
But, after ten years of mobilizing more than $300 million for health-care providers across multiple African countries, I am cautiously optimistic that a transformation is beginning to take hold.
Four essential elements are driving the continent’s health-care transformation: government-led efforts to achieve universal health coverage; market-led consolidation of health-care providers; major private-equity investors; and digital technology.
Political leaders across Sub-Saharan Africa generally agree that government-sponsored insurance is the foundation of universal health care.
In Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Africa, at least 60 million people now have some form of health insurance, according to health ministry data and a 2018 global analysis of Sub-Saharan Africa’s insurance markets.
That number is set to grow significantly.
As governments reimagine their role, shifting from care provider to payer, they could bring quality health care to millions. But much more needs to be done to make health insurance universal, comprehensive, and efficient.
For example, Ghana adopted a mandatory national health insurance program in 2003, but the country’s National Health Insurance Authority reported that it had enrolled only 38% of the population in the program’s first decade of existence.
Meanwhile, Rwanda boasts more than 90% penetration, but the services covered are limited mainly to primary care.
Providing health insurance to everyone is difficult and complicated.
Costs are a concern.
Some government-backed insurance schemes are plagued by high overhead, inefficiency, and allegations of delayed payments and corruption, all of which undermine their sustainability.
The solution is a combination of better governance and greater reliance on technology and the private sector to boost efficiency, reduce costs, and improve quality.
Governments will continue to play an important role, but partnering with the private sector is essential to reach health goals.
I see great promise on this front.
A sector traditionally dominated by thousands of small establishments is now benefiting from consolidation, which brings economies of scale, lower costs, consistent quality, and the power to attract high-quality staff.
In Kenya, for example, the Ladnan, Metropolitan, Avenue, and Nairobi Women’s hospitals, among others, now form a seven-city network of eight hospitals and 16 clinics under common ownership.
Similarly, in retail pharmacy, Goodlife – a client of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s commercial lending arm – runs 57 outlets.
Much of the market growth for these platform companies has come from mergers and acquisitions.
Looking ahead, I believe more players will grow organically through brownfield and greenfield developments of hospitals and by branching out into specialties.
As they grow, businesses must overcome stubborn structural hurdles such as low insurance penetration and medical skills shortages.
The third important element is institutional equity capital, which for too long was absent in Africa but is now becoming more widespread. In 2005, private-equity funds focused on African health care raised only $100,000, but by 2015 that figure had skyrocketed to $2 billion, according to a study of private equity in African health care from Preqin, a company that produces proprietary research on alternative assets.
Vehicles like the Africa Health Fund and Investment Funds for Health in Africa (IFHA) have invested an estimated $200 million in the region, spawning successor funds totaling $1.1 billion.
This private-equity investment is helping to professionalize financial management, improve business strategies and governance, and attract top-notch management talent. There is also a strong track record of profitable exits.
The fourth element, digital technology leveraging the ubiquitous mobile phone, has enabled the deployment of health care to distant and remote regions.
Telemedicine apps such as Babylon, which provides virtual consultations, are gaining traction.
As Africa’s disease profile shifts further to noncommunicable diseases, I expect that smartphones increasingly will be used not only for consultations, but also to diagnose pathological specimens and medical images, as well as to gather and analyze patient data to prevent diseases before they manifest.
Each of these interventions has the potential to reduce dramatically the cost of health care, improve quality, and do more with fewer resources.
Clearly, there are many reasons for optimism.
The building blocks have been laid: health-care systems funded by African governments via universal insurance schemes are being bolstered (where necessary) by private institutional capital and/or development aid, and by technology that broadens the system’s reach.
While a lot more remains to be done, Africa’s health-care sector is at an exciting crossroads.
The meeting of public policy, private entrepreneurs, investors, and technology is bound to transform the development landscape for the better.

The Lonely Arab Crowd
PARIS – In The Hubris of the Zero Point, the Colombian philosopher Santiago Castro-Gomez describes René Descartes’s 1637 declaration “I think, therefore I am” as the moment white Europeans installed themselves above God as the sole arbiters of knowledge and truth.
With this turning point, they began to think of themselves as observers whose scientific methods, morals, and ethics overrode those of other cultures.
Cultural “zero points” are important because they serve as a dividing line – a clear demarcation of “before” and “after” that holds fundamental implications for the development of private and public life.
So it is instructive to consider the implications of Castro-Gomez’s concept for the Arab world.
Indeed, it could be argued that much of the region’s troubles are attributable to the absence of an indigenous “zero point” onto which a modern culture could be sturdily pinned.
In The Lonely Crowd, the American sociologist David Riesman identified three broad cultural types: tradition-directed cultures that look to inherited rituals, morals, and values for guidance; inner-directed cultures, in which people behave according to self-nourished values; and other-directed cultures that react predominantly to external norms and peer influences. Riesman’s framework has particular resonance in the Arab world today, where rising literacy rates and rapid advances in communication technology have stirred a maelstrom of competing cultural narratives, with his three types competing to define the region’s future.
Ironically, it is the combination of increased literacy and modern technology that is fanning the flames of conflict between the two types of “reformers” – religious revivalists and Western-oriented modernizers.
Taking advantage of their ability to mass-produce and instantly disseminate ancient religious texts and Western-originating literature, the two camps battle for the hearts and minds of otherwise traditional societies.
According to the Lebanese publisher Samar Abou-Zeid, however, religious books are among the most downloaded works of literature in the Arab world.
The trouble is that most religious texts consumed today in the Arab world address an audience of specialists that no longer exists and – as Riesman warned – they are often misconstrued.
The people and the times for which these texts were written are completely different from the people reading them today.
Devout Muslims, of course, have their own zero point: the year 610, when the Angel Gabriel revealed the Koran’s first verse to the Prophet Muhammad.
From then on, many Muslims have regarded themselves as the bearers of a righteous truth and moral vision that takes precedence over all others.
This has inevitably put religious revivalists in opposition to the second cultural type vying for preeminence in the Arab world: Western-educated, inner-directed modernists who hold Descartes’s declaration as their reference point. These Arabs – often the economic elite – read, admire, and consume products of a culture that, despite its proclaimed commitment to “universal values,” continues to be stingily Eurocentric and dominated by Christian intellectual tradition.
As a result, they are increasingly likely to feel like exiles both at home and abroad.
The final, other-directed strand of Arab culture is arguably the most dominant: those whom Riesman would have called the “lonely Arab crowd.”
Free of roots or tradition, they take refuge in superficiality from the conflicts that surround them, seeking fulfillment in consumerism, careers, and lifestyles.
Their zero point is the latest fad or fashion.
This cultural turbulence is due – at least in part – to the absence of a contemporary homegrown intellectual tradition capable of providing Arab societies with an inner compass based on local values and modern perspectives.
This cultural vacuum is most evident in the mismatch between the region’s reading habits and the response of its publishing industry.
Egyptians, for example, read for an average of 7.5 hours per week, compared to five hours and 42 minutes in the United States.
And yet in 2012, according to Abou-Zeid, the entire Arab world and its 362 million inhabitants produced just over 15,000 titles, putting it in the same league as Romania (with a population of 21.3 million), Ukraine (45.6 million), or the American publisher Penguin Random House.
To maintain a similar proportion to population, the Arab world should be publishing 10-20 times more titles than it does today.
The dominance of old religious texts and Western-produced works has left modern Arab readers polarized, without a zero point of their own. It is ironic that increased literacy and adoption of modern technology have contributed not to intellectual growth, but to regional strife.
It may be no coincidence that Lebanon, one of the first countries in the region to boost literacy rates, was also the first to tumble into civil war.
Unless Arab and Muslim societies rediscover, revitalize, and in some respects create their homegrown contemporary intellectual tradition, the result will be cultural drift or, far worse, the continuation of bloody civil strife.

Making a Market for Scientific Research
Scientific advances are the fundamental cause of economic progress, and yet many nations often apparently hope to piggyback on discoveries made in more scientifically-advanced countries.
This is the most practical and efficient strategy in the early stages of development.
But, to reach the advanced stages of economic growth, a country needs scientific research at home.
Every government tries to encourage scientific research through education in science.
But education by itself is of only limited use here.
After all, science is a form of enterprise, requiring a sophisticated organization of resources and workers, an adventuresome attitude, and a willingness to take risks for possibly great rewards.
Normally, the market fosters the advance of entrepreneurial endeavors.
Were such a market for science to exist, scientists would form enterprises, just like businesses, the best of which would succeed, while others would fail.
The problem is that basic scientific research is mostly a public good that cannot be withheld from those who use it and which seeps into the body of scientific know-how in unanticipated ways.
But if there is no market that impersonally values and rewards scientific achievement, how are good scientific projects to be selected and rewarded without the great waste that often accompanies non-market, bureaucratic solutions to the problems of provision of public goods?
There is a danger that scientific establishments may degenerate into fiefdoms controlled by scientific mandarins who dominate major state-funded university departments and laboratories.
Indeed, scientists in a number of countries, some with past scientific glories, may already recognize this malady in their own institutions today.
The price their countries pay is a more sclerotic and slowly growing economy.
No perfect substitutes for the market in the area of scientific discovery exist, but a good surrogate, which enables scientists to compete effectively, is the system of peer review , i.e., the anonymous evaluation of research by scientific colleagues.
Top scientists, sheltered by anonymity, can usually spot originality and can judge which scientific ideas have real value.
Peer review grew out of the first two scientific journals, the Journal des Sçavans in France and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in England, both founded in 1665.
These journals cast a wide net for the best research and relied on leading experts to evaluate ideas.
But their support of scientific research was limited to publication.
In the 1940's, Vannevar Bush, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and science advisor to President Roosevelt, advocated the creation of a government agency that would dramatically expand the impact of peer review by using it to allocate significant financial support to research enterprises.
In his 1945 book Science, the Endless Frontier , Bush argued that basic scientific research needs substantial and stable financial support; that support should be potentially available to all researchers; and that peer review should ultimately decide how and to whom funds are allocated.
Those who dispense money, he argued, should look only at new research ideas, not at the organizational charts of research institutions. His book led to the creation, in 1950, of the US National Science Foundation (NSF), a major factor underlying America scientific success.
The use of anonymous peer review to assess proposals and allocate financial support for scientific research is increasingly achieving recognition around the world.
Most major countries now have some kind of agency that issues general calls for proposals and uses peer review to evaluate them.
Problems remain, however, in making newly established peer-review systems work well.
Smaller countries face difficulties in ensuring anonymity: the number of qualified scientists within a specific field may be so small that researchers can easily guess who reviews which proposals, and powerful figures can retaliate for negative evaluations of their unpromising research ideas.
This is an important reason why the proposed European Research Council is a good idea.
Modeled after the NSF, it would augment the science foundations of individual European countries, creating a much larger research organization - one that draws from a larger pool of proposals.
The size of the market for peer review is not the only issue.
Countries with politicized universities, or universities where bosses with powerful connections outside academia run the research enterprise, find it difficult to fund the best scientists.
The same is true in systems where there is a strong sense of bureaucratic entitlement.
Japan is an example of a country where the science establishment has been insufficiently reformed.
Government bureaucrats used to target industrial research in the old days, but these efforts have been largely abandoned since the stock market collapse.
The government then increased funding for basic research and created "centers of excellence" at universities, but it failed to dismantle the koza system, in which powerful senior professors often dominate research departments.
Greater progress is being made in Germany, where, despite popular opposition to an elitist university system such as in the US, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called last year for German universities to become much more competitive with each other.
Similar changes can be expected in other countries, as the importance of scientific competition and entrepreneurship becomes better understood.
Policies that allow scientists to compete for resources nurture creative competition and allow people to construct appropriate incentives and risk-management structures.
They are part of a worldwide trend whereby natural and culturally specific obstacles to a competitive and financially sophisticated marketplace for scientific research are gradually removed.
There can be no free market for basic science in the literal sense of the term. But the benefits of markets can and should be pursued by other means.

Preventing an Evergrande Confidence Crisis in China
NEW YORK – Many have attributed the recent decline in major global stock market indices to concerns about the heavily indebted Chinese property development group Evergrande.
To restore investor confidence and minimize economic damage, the Chinese authorities must eliminate any doubt that they will do what is necessary to contain potential spillovers from an Evergrande default.
Evergrande specializes in building and selling residential apartments in second- and third-tier Chinese cities, although it also dabbles in other businesses, including manufacturing electric vehicles.
The firm’s total liabilities are estimated to be about CN¥2 trillion (roughly $300 billion), which is equivalent to approximately 2% of China’s GDP in 2020.
On one level, the actual financial problem is substantially smaller than this number suggests.
Evergrande owns many tangible assets, including land (technically, the right to build on it), completed apartments that have not yet been sold, and partly constructed apartment buildings.
According to the company, the value of its assets exceeds that of its liabilities.
But on another level, the potential negative shock of an Evergrande default for the Chinese economy could amount to much more than a $300 billion loss.
For starters, the company has a series of loans and bonds falling due in the coming weeks and months.
Meeting these repayments will require cash, not illiquid real estate.
If the group is forced to dispose of assets in a fire sale, it will face a substantial financial haircut.
Three other sources of uncertainty could greatly magnify the negative impact of an Evergrande default on the rest of the Chinese economy.
First, there would be a psychological spillover to many other property developers that, like Evergrande, use debt to finance their operations.
If potential lenders to these companies are worried about the property sector’s demise, many firms may find that their funding dries up.
As fears of a chain of bankruptcies in the sector become self-fulfilling, a large number of these firms will go under, too.
Then there is the spillover from Evergrande to China’s financial system.
While the extent of the firm’s borrowing from banks and non-bank financial institutions is easy to discover and document, the channels and the size of various indirect effects are more uncertain.
For example, if Evergrande goes under, many of its steel, cement, and equipment suppliers also may have trouble repaying their bank loans.
Banks’ outstanding loans to other property firms could become non-performing as well.
Separately, Evergrande has also aggressively tapped into China’s shadow banking sector to finance its operations, and some of this borrowing is managed by non-listed parts of the group that do not disclose their balance sheets fully.
There is no transparent and audited account of the size of these borrowings.
The third and perhaps most important source of uncertainty is whether the Chinese authorities can prevent a full-blown financial meltdown if the Evergrande problem develops into a systemic crisis. Because China has a much lower government-debt-to-GDP ratio (about 70% in 2021) than the United States (133%), Japan (257%), and France (115%), the government still has the fiscal capacity to deal with a potential crisis.
And the People’s Bank of China has the tools and ability to inject liquidity into the economy to address any potential credit freeze.
What is less certain is whether the authorities have the will to take such steps.
Evergrande is not a state-owned entity, and the government might be reluctant to help the firm’s multi-billionaire founder and controlling shareholder, Hui Ka Yan, in view of its current “common prosperity” campaign.
The Chinese authorities can take two steps to prevent a bank run and calm capital markets.
The first is to communicate clearly that they can save Evergrande’s many stakeholders (other than Hui).
These include its lenders and employees, and households that have paid the company for an apartment but have not yet received one.
This can be accomplished by facilitating other firms’ purchases of construction projects and other assets from Evergrande.
Second, the government can announce a contingency plan involving quick and decisive steps to stop the various spillovers in the event that Evergrande goes bankrupt.
Policymakers should document and disclose each lender’s exposure to the company, and emphasize the government’s will and capacity to use a combination of fiscal and monetary measures to ensure that Chinese financial institutions will be able to fulfill all their obligations, come what may.
The authorities may well be looking into these steps now.
But publicly announcing such a plan can remove the uncertainty about the government’s readiness and ability to act, and thus can go a long way toward ending the market panic.

The Tacit-Knowledge Economy
CAMBRIDGE – Almost all rich countries are rich because they exploit technological progress.
They have moved the bulk of their labor force out of agriculture and into cities, where knowhow can be shared more easily.
Their families have fewer children and educate them more intensively, thereby facilitating further technological progress.
Poor countries need to go through a similar change in order to become rich: reduce farm employment, become more urban, have fewer children, and keep those children that they have in school longer.
If they do, the doors to prosperity will open.
And isn’t that already happening?
Let us compare, for example, Brazil in 2010 with the United Kingdom in 1960.
Brazil in 2010 was 84.3% urban; its fertility rate was 1.8 births per woman; its labor force had an average of 7.2 years of schooling; and its university graduates accounted for 5.2% of potential workers.
These are better social indicators than the United Kingdom had in 1960.
At that time, the UK was 78.4% urban; its fertility rate was 2.7; its labor force had six years of schooling on average, and its university graduates accounted for less than 2% of potential workers.
Brazil is not a unique case: Colombia, Tunisia, Turkey, and Indonesia in 2010 compare favorably to Japan, France, the Netherlands, and Italy, respectively, in 1960.
Not only did these countries achieve better social indicators in these dimensions; they also could benefit from the technological innovations of the past half-century: computers, cellphones, the Internet, Teflon, and so on.
This should allow higher productivity than was feasible in 1960.
So today’s emerging-market economies should be richer than today’s advanced economies were back then, right?
Wrong – and by a substantial margin.
Per capita GDP at constant prices was 140% higher in Britain in 1960 than in Brazil in 2010.
It was 80% higher in Japan back then than in Colombia today, 42% higher in old France than in current Tunisia, 250% higher in the old Netherlands than in current Turkey, and 470% higher in old Italy than in current Indonesia.
Why is it that today’s smaller and more educated urbanized families in emerging-market economies are so much less productive than their counterparts were a half-century ago in today’s rich countries?
Why can’t today’s emerging markets replicate levels of productivity that were achieved in countries with worse social indicators and much older technologies?
The key to this puzzle is tacit knowledge.
To make stuff, you need to know how to make it, and this knowledge is, to a large extent, latent – not available in books, but stored in the brains of those who need to use it.
Getting it there is really tough.
Tacit knowledge is acquired mostly through learning by doing.
That is how we train musicians, barbers, doctors, and scientists.
Consider how long it takes an adult to learn to speak a language or a musician to master the violin.
Moreover, tacit knowledge is vast and growing, so that only a miniscule fraction of it fits in anybody’s head.
But most products require much more knowledge than fits in anybody’s head, so that making them requires teams of people with different pieces of knowledge, not unlike a symphonic orchestra.
Getting more tacit knowledge is easier said than done, because economies can offer experience only on the basis of current jobs.
How do people learn to do jobs that do not yet exist?
How do they create and mobilize coherent teams of people in new economic activities if the requisite tacit knowledge is missing?
Recent research at Harvard University’s Center for International Development (CID) suggests that tacit knowledge flows through amazingly slow and narrow channels.
The productivity of Nuevo León, Mexico, is higher than in South Korea, but that of Guerrero, another Mexican state, resembles levels in Honduras.
Moving knowledge across Mexican states has been difficult and slow.
It is easier to move brains than it is to move tacit knowledge into brains, and not only in Mexico.
For example, as the CID’s Frank Neffke has shown, when new industries are launched in German and Swedish cities, it is mostly because entrepreneurs and firms from other cities move in, bringing with them skilled workers with relevant industry experience.
They seldom hire locals.
The recently deceased economist Steven Klepper argued that industries tend to cluster in particular cities simply because new firms are formed mainly by workers who leave other successful firms, taking the relevant tacit knowledge with them.
Indeed, a large literature on knowledge spillovers points to their remarkably narrow geographic range.
The exceptions often confirm the rule. The US would not have been able to build the first atomic bomb in just four years had Hitler not encouraged so many key scientists to leave Europe.
The bottom line is that urbanization, schooling, and Internet access are woefully insufficient to transmit effectively the tacit knowledge required to be productive.
That is why today’s emerging markets are so much less productive than rich countries were in 1960, even though the latter were less urban, had higher birth rates and less formal schooling, and used much older technologies.
The policy implications are clear.
Knowhow resides in brains, and emerging and developing countries should focus on attracting them, instead of erecting barriers to skilled immigration.
They should tap into their diasporas, attract foreign direct investment in new areas, and acquire foreign firms if possible.
Knowledge moves when people do.

The March of the Caudillos
LA PAZ -- The re-election for unlimited periods that Presidents Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales have sought in Venezuela and Bolivia, respectively, reflects a phenomenon – caudillismo – that has, sadly, never been far from the surface of Latin American politics.
At least Russian president Vladimir Putin had the decency to honor the form of his country’s constitution when he recently promised to step down and run for parliament.
Of course, several recent Latin American presidents succeeded in changing their countries’ constitutions to lengthen their terms in office.
Argentina’s Carlos Menem, the heir to Peronism, the continent’s most enduring form of caudillismo , was one such example, but his was a soft caudillismo , which basically maintained democratic norms .
C audillismo has two key facets.
First, because it is, above all, a form of political representation, it can have its own local particularities.
Second, although caudillismo personalizes politics, it depends less on the characteristics of the caudillo than on the social, political, and economic conditions of the country in which caudillismo takes root.
In other words, although a caudillo ’s charisma matters, he or she is a social creation.
These two ideas are helpful in understanding Chávez and Morales.
Like the old caudillos , they concentrate representation of their supporters in themselves.
Whereas representation in democratic countries is based on people’s confidence that they can achieve a better future under their elected leaders, in countries like Venezuela and Bolivia nowadays, representation is based on a simple identification with the leader: “He’s one of us.”
The way “us” is defined links the caudillo with his supporters by building an uncomplicated and easily invoked collective identity that facilitates communication and political mobilization, while also implying submission by all citizens.
Morales and Chávez always emphasize their humble origins in order to appeal emotionally to those who share those characteristics with them, and to blackmail those who do not.
This image is strengthened each time the caudillo engages in confrontation with some large, and usually vaguely defined, enemy: the Empire or the United States, the oligarchies, the traditional parties, or the transnational corporations.
But caudillos have other uses for conflict: it allows them to strengthen the unity of their popular bases and evade the management responsibilities that exercising political power entails.
They construct politics in such a way that there will always be an enemy to blame for any problems that arise.
Chávez and Morales have been accumulating power by dismantling their societies’ fragile institutional checks and balances, while permanently weakening their adversaries.
Traditional parties and the administrations that preceded the caudillo are dismissed as corrupt and elitist.
It follows from this that constitutions must be changed to reduce the role of Congress, subordinate the judiciary, and centralize economic resources.
In such schemes, Chávez has so far had more success than Morales, whose Constitutional Assembly has not yet been able to organize itself.
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador looks like he also wants to move in the same direction.
The rise of these modern caudillos reflects a crisis in political parties and an acute intensification of social unease across the continent.
Latin America’s economic and social structures remain marked by great inequality, weak institutions, and an abundance of natural resources.
Chávez and Morales, each in his own way, have taken advantage of this situation, worsening conditions to enfeeble their opponents and living off the wealth generated by natural resources, not new economic activity.
With a popular base that demands change – and that knows that change requires gaining access to state-owned wealth – social attitudes have developed that are receptive to the promises made by the caudillos .
The weaker a country’s institutions, the more evident the inequalities, and the more concentrated the economic resources, the greater the caudillo’s powers will be.
Concentration of resources is probably the key factor, because it increases both the discretionary power of whoever controls them and the population’s social expectations, which in the end cannot ever be met, because the caudillo’s power depends on maintaining that concentration of resources.
Caudillismo will be weakened only if profits are not captured by the state, but directly shared with citizens in a stable and continuous manner.
A decline in extreme poverty and inequality, and the creation of trustworthy institutions, can be achieved in the country’s beguiled by caudillismo only if the caudillo loses control of the wealth that sustains his rule.

The New Climate Economics
NEW YORK – This Friday, in its latest comprehensive assessment of the evidence on global warming, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will show that the world’s climate scientists are more certain than ever that human activity – largely combustion of fossil fuels – is causing temperatures and sea levels to rise.
In recent years, a series of extreme weather events – including Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey, floods in China, and droughts in the American Midwest, Russia, and many developing countries – have caused immense damage.
Last week, Mexico experienced simultaneous hurricanes in the Pacific and in the Gulf of Mexico that devastated towns and cities in their path. Climate change will be a major driver of such events, and we risk much worse.
This puts a new debate center stage: how to reconcile increased action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with strong economic growth.
It is a debate that is already mired in controversy.
As most countries have started making serious investments in renewable energy, and many are implementing carbon prices and regulations, critics complain that such policies may undermine growth. With the global economy still recovering from the 2008 financial crash, higher energy costs – not yet fully offset by greater energy efficiency – are worrying business and political leaders.
The advent of shale gas has confused the energy debate even more. If gas is substituted for coal, it can be a useful bridge to a low-carbon future.
But astonishingly, it is coal, the dirtiest fuel, that is experiencing the sharpest increase in use.
Companies and investors are hedging their bets by taking a few resource-efficiency measures and investing in some low-carbon assets, but leaving their high-carbon portfolios and activities largely intact.
Policy vacillation in some countries has not helped.
Advocates of stronger action respond that low-carbon investments can generate much stronger, cleaner growth. They point to the savings available from energy efficiency, and to the market opportunities generated by clean-energy technologies as the processes of learning and discovery take hold.
They seek to demonstrate the benefits that a more sustainable pattern of development can bring to the world’s cities, to people’s health (from the reduction in air pollution), to energy security, and to the ability of the world’s poor to access energy.
And they propose green bonds and public investment banks to finance new infrastructure and jobs at a time when world interest rates are low and demand is depressed in many countries.
These are serious economic debates, but too often they have become entangled in ideological disputes about the appropriate response to the economic crisis and the value of government intervention in markets.
That is regrettable.
Climate change is not a partisan issue, and climate policy is essentially market-based.
It is about correcting market failures so that markets and entrepreneurship can play their proper role of ensuring innovation and efficient resource allocation.
In order to escape this impasse, we have helped to launch the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.
The Commission’s New Climate Economy project brings together seven leading policy research institutes from six continents, overseen by a panel of former heads of government and finance ministers and prominent business leaders, and advised by a panel of leading economists from across the world.
Its purpose is to provide authoritative new evidence concerning how governments and businesses can achieve stronger economic growth while simultaneously addressing climate risks.
Few governments or investors start from the standpoint of climate change.
They want to promote investment and economic growth, create jobs, stabilize public finances, expand markets, turn profits, ensure reliable energy and food supplies, produce goods and services, reduce poverty, and build cities. So the primary question that we need to ask is not whether we can reduce emissions, but how public policy can help to achieve these core goals while reducing emissions and building a more climate-resilient economy.
There is now a lot of experience around the world in this area.
When the Stern Review on the economics of climate change was published seven years ago, the subject was largely theoretical.
Now countries at all stages of development are pursuing new patterns of economic growth that take climate into account.
Germany, for example, is planning the world’s most ambitious low-carbon energy transition, based on energy conservation and renewables.
South Korea has made “green growth” a central economic goal.
Mexico’s 2012 General Law on Climate Change has put it on course for a major increase in clean power.
China has placed the industrial development of green technologies at the top of its agenda.
Ethiopia is seeking to move to lower-carbon farming.
Brazil has significantly reduced the rate of deforestation in the Amazon.
Some major businesses are providing powerful examples of what is possible.
Unilever has committed to the sustainable sourcing of agricultural and forest products. Coca-Cola is phasing out all use of climate-polluting hydrofluorocarbons.
The retail giant Wal-Mart is driving emissions reduction throughout its supply chain.
Meanwhile, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank have stopped lending to high-emission coal plants.
Yet genuine questions remain about how fast economies should move on to a low-carbon path, and the most effective way to do so.
Some low-carbon policies have clearly been expensive, while other, apparently cost-effective options, have not been pursued at all.
Any structural transformation involves costs, trade-offs, and uncertainties, and it is vital that we understand these properly.
Powerful interests will, of course, oppose any low-carbon transition, dismissing and often drowning out those who stand to benefit.
That makes it even more important to clarify the choices.
As science makes clear how imperative the climate question is, it is time for economists and policymakers to explain how it can be answered.

A Korean Helsinki Process?
SEOUL – Last month, North and South Korea narrowly avoided a catastrophic military confrontation.
After 40 hours of strenuous negotiations, the South agreed to stop loudspeaker broadcasts into the demilitarized zone between the two countries, in exchange for the North expressing “regret” for the South Korean soldiers killed by a landmine blast in the DMZ three weeks earlier.
While the crisis featured North Korea’s familiar belligerence and aggressive rhetoric, there were also some interesting new twists.
Understanding these developments could help to generate enough momentum to initiate, after more than seven years of confrontation, genuine inter-Korean cooperation and help guide the peninsula toward a more peaceful and secure future.
The first new development is the South Korean leadership’s much firmer response to provocations from the North.
In 2010, the South Korean public was sharply critical of the military’s failure to retaliate immediately following the North’s sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean warship carrying more than 100 personnel, and its shelling of Yeonpyeong Island later that year.
After the recent landmine blasts, by contrast, President Park Geun-hye would not back down from her demands that the North, which denied planting the mines, apologize. Her approval ratings soared to 50%, from around 34% the previous month.
This shift, while popular in South Korea, carries serious risks for the peninsula.
If an unyielding South becomes engaged in another military game of chicken with the often-audacious and always-erratic North, the results could be catastrophic.
In this sense, an institutional framework for permanent inter-Korean peace is more urgent than ever.
The second development relates to China, which remained silent throughout the latest crisis – a significant departure from its stance in 2010, when it actively sided with North Korea on the international diplomatic stage.
Of course, it is impossible to know whether China’s response this time marks a genuine strategic withdrawal from its role as the North’s only ally and key economic benefactor.
China’s leaders may simply have decided that a tactical disciplining of the North’s leadership was in order.
But, at a time when China’s relationship with South Korea is deepening, the silence has been deafening.
If China really is distancing itself from North Korea, Kim Jong-un’s regime will be almost entirely isolated internationally.
Will Kim respond to that isolation recklessly, by continuing to antagonize the South, or pragmatically, by becoming more flexible?
That is not an easy question to answer.
It should be clear to Kim by now that his parade of provocations is not benefiting his country.
His bellicose behavior in 2013, for example, worsened his relationships with China, South Korea, and the United States simultaneously; and in the recent crisis, all he earned was a halt to mocking loudspeaker broadcasts.
But Kim is not exactly known for his pragmatism or diplomacy.
Kim’s intentions may become clearer next month, when the North is expected to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party by conducting a nuclear test and launching a new intercontinental missile.
But China, South Korea, and the US – whose policies toward North Korea are now more closely aligned than ever – should not simply wait to see what happens.
They should initiate a dialogue with the North and take steps to dissuade Kim from continuing on his path of antagonism.
The third new development on the peninsula is a growing awareness among North Koreans of their country’s dire situation.
At this point, the shift is most apparent among North Korean soldiers in the DMZ, for whom the South’s recent broadcasts were highly demoralizing.
Today’s young soldiers represent the so-called Jangmadang (“black market”) generation that came of age under the marketization process that followed the massive famine in the mid-1990s.
Exposed to South Korean movies, music, and other products, they recognize the yawning gap between their government’s propaganda and the country’s grim reality.
The South’s loudspeaker broadcasts drove the point home.
As the marketization process continues, soon it won’t be just the soldiers who see through the regime’s propaganda.
The time for bottom-up change in the North may not be far off.
This opens up a new policy option for the West: impelling North Korea to dial back its foreign and security policy by deepening its economic and social engagement with the rest of the world.
The benefits for the North would drastically change the regime’s strategic calculus, particularly concerning nuclear weapons.
International linkages – or, rather, sanctions that blocked the benefits of such linkages – were vital to Libya’s decision to denuclearize and Iran’s willingness to reach an agreement with world powers regarding its nuclear program.
Sanctions have been less effective in North Korea, largely because the population did not know what it was missing.
Similarly, growing connections between groups within the Soviet bloc and the West played a major role in bringing about the 1975 Helsinki Accords.
The accords represented an effort to improve East-West relations during the Cold War, and included an emphasis on human rights.
Most important, they achieved the kind of sustained engagement that is badly needed on the Korean Peninsula today.
The aftermath of the August crisis may be the moment to think seriously about how to balance continued sanctions on North Korea with deeper economic and social ties.
Without such an approach, North and South Korea could, before long, be locked in another military standoff.
The next one may not end so well as the last.

Trump’s Psychopathology Is Getting Worse
NEW YORK – Seemingly every day now, US President Donald Trump escalates his policy and personal attacks against other countries and their heads of state, the poor and the weak, and migrant families.
Most recently, Trump has championed the heartless separation of migrant children from their parents.
Though public outrage may have forced him to retreat, his disposition to attack will soon make itself felt elsewhere.
Most pundits interpret Trump’s outbursts as playing to his political base, or preening for the cameras, or blustering for the sake of striking future deals.
We take a different view.
In line with many of America’s renowned mental-health experts, we believe that Trump suffers from several psychological pathologies that render him a clear and present danger to the world.
Trump shows signs of at least three dangerous traits: paranoia, lack of empathy, and sadism.
Paranoia is a form of detachment from reality in which an individual perceives threats that do not exist. The paranoid individual can create dangers for others in the course of fighting against imaginary threats.
Lack of empathy can derive from an individual’s preoccupation with the self and a view of others as mere tools. Harming others causes no remorse when it serves one’s own purposes.
Sadism means finding pleasure in inflicting pain or humiliating others, especially those who represent a perceived threat or a reminder of one’s weaknesses.
We believe that Trump has these traits.
We base our conclusion on observations of his actions, his known life history, and many reports by others, rather than as the finding of an independent psychiatric examination, which we have previously called for, and call for again.
But we do not need a complete picture to recognize that Trump is already a growing danger to the world. Psychological expertise tells us that such traits tend to worsen in individuals who gain power over others.
To justify his belligerent actions, Trump lies relentlessly and remorselessly.
In fact, according to a Washington Post analysis, Trump has made over 3,000 false or misleading claims since taking office.
And, the Post notes, his lying seems to have escalated in recent weeks.
Moreover, Trump’s confidants describe him as increasingly likely to ignore any moderating advice offered by those around him.
There are no “grownups in the room” who can stop him as he surrounds himself with corrupt and bellicose cronies prepared to do his bidding – all of which is entirely predictable from his psychology.
Trump’s wild exaggerations in recent weeks reveal the increasing severity of his symptoms.
Consider, for example, his repeated claims that the vague outcome of his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un constitutes an end to the nuclear threat posed by Kim’s regime, or his blatant lie that Democrats, rather than his own policies, caused the forced separation of migrant children from their parents at the southern border with Mexico.
The Post recently counted 29 false or misleading statements in a mere one-hour rally. Whether intentional or delusional, this level of persistent lying is pathological.
Since Trump actually lacks the ability to impose his will on others, his approach guarantees an endless cycle of threats, counter-threats, and escalation.
He follows any tactical retreat with renewed aggression.
Such is the case with the spiraling tit-for-tat trade war now underway between Trump and a widening circle of countries and economies, including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union.
The same is true of Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from a growing number of international agreements and bodies, including the Paris climate agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, and, most recently, the United Nations Human Rights Council, after it criticized US policies towards the poor.
Trump’s paranoia is translating into heightened geopolitical tensions.
Traditional allies, not accustomed to dealing with US leaders with severe mental defects, are clearly shaken, while adversaries appear to be taking advantage.
Many of Trump’s supporters seem to interpret his shameless lying as bold truth-telling, and pundits and foreign leaders tend to believe that his bizarre lashing out reflects a political strategy.
Yet this is a misunderstanding.
Trump’s actions are being “explained” as rational and even bold, whereas they more likely are manifestations of severe psychological problems.
History abounds with mentally impaired individuals who have gained vast power as would-be saviors, only to become despots who gravely damage their societies and others.
Their strength of will and promises of national greatness entice a public following; but if there is one lesson of this kind of pathology in power, it is that the long-term results are inescapably catastrophic for all.
We should not remain immobilized by fear of a future disaster.
A leader with dangerous signs of paranoia, lack of empathy, and sadism should not remain in the presidency, lest he commit devastating damage.
Any appropriate measure to remove the danger – the ballot box, impeachment, or invocation of the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment – would help restore our safety.

The Return of Japan
TOKYO – “Japan is back!” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared during a visit to Washington, DC, earlier this year.
But, while Japan may be on the right track after two decades of economic stagnation, there is still much to be done to secure the country’s long-term future.
In July, Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won control of both houses of parliament – a resounding electoral victory that amounts to the strongest political mandate any Japanese leader has received in many years.
As a result, Abe seems likely to remain in power longer than his ineffectual predecessors, most of whom did not last more than a year.
Meanwhile, Japan’s economy seems to be recovering from a generation of malaise, with this year’s annualized growth rate exceeding 3%.
Moreover, following the triple shock of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear catastrophe in 2011, Japan has managed (at considerable cost) to replace the 25% of its energy supply that the disabled reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant provided.
The announcement that Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympic Games has also boosted public confidence.
Skeptics worry that the economic progress may not last, arguing that the high growth rate is simply a reflection of loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus – a strategy that inflation will render unsustainable.
Abe’s supporters reply that the third “arrow” of “Abenomics” – productivity-enhancing structural reforms – has only now been removed from its quiver. They point to Abe’s ability to overcome resistance from small rice farmers, part of the LDP’s electoral base, to Japan’s participation in negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would open Japan’s economy to increased global competition.
Nevertheless, Japan faces serious long-term challenges.
First, with its birth rate well below replacement level, Japan’s population is aging and shrinking.
Offsetting this trend will require increased immigration and greater female labor-force participation – neither of which will be easy to bring about.
Japan has not traditionally been a country of immigration, and the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, which ranks 136 countries, has Japan in 105th place.
But, of course, this can change – and Japan does have a history of successfully reinventing itself.
Perhaps the most critical question about Japan’s future concerns its relationship with its neighbors – North Korea, South Korea, and China.
While recent polls suggest that Japan retains substantial soft power globally, this is not the case in its immediate neighborhood.
Unlike Europe, where Germany overcame World War II’s legacy through its integration into the European Union, Northeast Asia remains burdened by history.
According to its neighbors, Japan’s apologies for is past aggression are inadequate.
It does not help that some Korean and Chinese leaders have used anti-Japanese rhetoric to win domestic support.
In Japan, the relentless criticism has triggered a nationalist backlash, spurring politicians to respond in kind during last year’s election campaign. For example, Abe threatened to rescind the official apologies issued by former leaders or officials for abuses and atrocities committed by Japan’s army during WWII, and stated his intention to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors not only Japan’s war dead, but also many of its war criminals.
While Abe has not acted on these campaign statements, some observers remain convinced that he will visit Yasukuni at some point, further straining Japan’s relations with South Korea and China.
Territorial disputes have exacerbated these tensions significantly.
China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets – called the Senkaku Islands in Japan, and the Diaoyu Islands in China – in the East China Sea.
While the rival claims date back to the late nineteenth century, the latest flare-up – which has included widespread anti-Japanese demonstrations in China – was triggered in September 2012, when Japan’s government purchased three of the tiny islets from their private Japanese owner.
Then-Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said that he decided to purchase the islands for the Japanese central government to prevent Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara from purchasing them with municipal funds.
Noda feared that Ishihara, who was well known for nationalist grandstanding, would try to occupy the islands or find other ways to use them to provoke China.
But Chinese officials viewed the move as proof that Japan was trying to disrupt the status quo.
Some even claimed that Japan was trying to reverse the territorial outcome of WWII.
The May 1972 transfer back to Japan of Okinawa, which the United States had administered, included the Senkaku Islands.
A few months later, when China and Japan were working to normalize relations, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai about the islets; Zhou responded that the dispute should be left to later generations, in order to avoid any delay of normalization.
As a result, both countries maintained their sovereignty claims.
So, though Japan has administrative control, Chinese ships and planes frequently enter Japanese waters to assert China’s claim.
While Japan’s security treaty with the US serves as a deterrent, there is always a danger of miscalculation.
A quick resolution of the Senkaku Islands dispute (or of Japan’s lower-profile conflict with South Korea over the Korean-controlled Liancourt Rocks) is improbable, but Japan could be more proactive.
For example, by stating their willingness to take any territorial disputes to the International Court of Justice, Japanese authorities could help to dispel perceptions of militarism.
Furthermore, Japan should take the sovereign act of designating the Senkaku Islands as an international maritime preserve free of habitation or military use.
China might not agree, but such a move might at least return the issue to the back burner, while reinforcing Japan’s image as a peaceful power.
Japan and Northeast Asia need bold initiatives that focus on the future.
It is time to give history a rest.

Virtual Vices
In a popular Internet role-playing game called Second Life, people can create a virtual identity for themselves, choosing such things as their age, sex, and appearance.
These virtual characters then do things that people in the real world do, such as having sex.
Depending on your preferences, you can have sex with someone who is older or younger than you – perhaps much older or younger.
In fact, if your virtual character is an adult, you can have sex with a virtual character who is a child.
If you did that in the real world, most of us would agree that you did something seriously wrong.
But is it seriously wrong to have virtual sex with a virtual child?
Some Second Life players say that it is, and have vowed to expose those who do it.
Meanwhile, the manufacturers, Linden Labs, have said they will modify the game to prevent virtual children from having sex.
German prosecutors have also become involved, although their concern appears to be the use of the game to spread child pornography, rather than whether people have virtual sex with virtual children.
Laws against child pornography in other countries may also have the effect of prohibiting games that permit virtual sex with virtual children.
In Australia, Connor O’Brien, chair of the criminal law section of the Law Institute of Victoria, recently told the Melbourne newspaper The Age that he thought the manufacturer of Second Life could be prosecuted for publishing images of children in a sexual context.
The law is on solid ground when it protects children from being exploited for sexual purposes.
It becomes much more dubious when it interferes with sexual acts between consenting adults.
What adults choose to do in the bedroom, many thoughtful people believe, is their own business, and the state ought not to pry into it.
If you get aroused by having your adult partner dress up as a schoolchild before you have sex, and he or she is happy to enter into that fantasy, your behavior may be abhorrent to most people, but as long as it is done in private, few would think that it makes you a criminal.
Nor should it make any difference if you invite a few adult friends over, and in the privacy of your own home they all choose to take part in a larger-scale sexual fantasy of the same kind.
Are computers linked via the Internet – again, assuming that only consenting adults are involved – so different from a group fantasy of this kind?
When someone proposes making something a criminal offense, we should always ask: who is harmed?
If it can be shown that the opportunity to act out a fantasy by having virtual sex with a virtual child makes people more likely to engage in real pedophilia, then real children will be harmed, and the case for prohibiting virtual pedophilia becomes stronger.
But looking at the question in this way raises another, and perhaps more significant, issue about virtual activities: video game violence.
Those who play violent video games are often at an impressionable age.
Doom, a popular violent videogame, was a favorite of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the teenage Columbine High School murderers.
In a chilling videotape they made before the massacre, Harris says “It's going to be like fucking Doom….That fucking shotgun [he kisses his gun] is straight out of Doom!”
There are other cases in which aficionados of violent videogames have become killers, but they do not prove cause and effect.
More weight, however, should be given to the growing number of scientific studies, both in the laboratory and in the field, of the effect of such games.
In Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adults, Craig Anderson, Douglas Gentile, and Katherine Buckley, of the Department of Psychology at Iowa State University, draw these studies together to argue that violent video games increase aggressive behavior.
If criminal prosecution is too blunt an instrument to use against violent video games, there is a case for awarding damages to the victims, or families of the victims, of violent crimes committed by people who play violent video games.
To date, such lawsuits have been dismissed, at least in part on the grounds that the manufacturers could not foresee that their products would cause people to commit crimes.
But the evidence that Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley provide has weakened that defense.
André Peschke, editor-in-chief of Krawall.de , one of Germany’s leading online computer and video game magazines, informs me that in ten years in the video game industry, he has never seen any serious debate within the industry on the ethics of producing violent games.
The manufacturers fall back on the simplistic assertion that there is no scientific proof that violent video games lead to violent acts. But sometimes we cannot wait for proof.
This seems to be one of those cases: the risks are great, and outweigh whatever benefits violent video games may have.
The evidence may not be conclusive, but it is too strong to be ignored any longer.
The burst of publicity about virtual pedophilia in Second Life may have focused on the wrong target.
Video games are properly subject to legal controls, not when they enable people to do things that, if real, would be crimes, but when there is evidence on the basis of which we can reasonably conclude that they are likely to increase serious crime in the real world.
At present, the evidence for that is stronger for games involving violence than it is for virtual realities that permit pedophilia.

How to Avert a Global Climate Catastrophe
AMMAN – The hottest day on record in Jordan since 1960 was a staggering 49.3° Celsius, (120.7° Fahrenheit) in July 2018, one month after I became prime minister.
Jordan is not unique: heat waves have been causing record-high temperatures in countries from Canada to Australia in recent years.
The effects of climate change (including increased frequency and severity of floods, hurricanes, and droughts), while felt locally, demand a global response, which should set binding targets that take into account countries’ contributions to the problem and to the solution.
Jordan has been actively pursuing policies and programs to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.
Over the past 15 years, Jordan’s annual emissions per capita fell from 3.5 tons to 2.5 tons.
But Jordan, like the vast majority of countries, accounts for a negligible share of global CO2 emissions – just 0.04% annually. So even if Jordan was to turn its whole economy green overnight, it would hardly make a dent.
This does not absolve us of responsibility, but we cannot overlook the fact that emissions are concentrated: the top 20 emitters account for almost 80% of the annual total, with the United States and China alone accounting for 38%.
In many countries, the ramifications of climate change for water supply have been staggering. In the case of Jordan, it made an already tight constraint much more acute.
Rainfall was previously the savior for rural communities that engaged in seasonal rainfed agriculture and herding on semi-arid land.
Over the last decade, however, a steady decline in average annual rainfall and an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts have undermined these modes of agriculture, deepening the socioeconomic divide between rural and urban areas.
Jordan is by no means unique: the World Health Organization estimates that half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025.
In essence, what was previously a regional challenge has now become a serious global governance issue with environmental, political, and economic ramifications.
More broadly, other manifestations of climate change, and the lack of an internationally coordinated response to them – not to mention to additional threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic – suggest that something is seriously wrong at the global level.
According to the recent sober assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world will not meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C unless it makes huge additional cuts in CO2 emissions.
Quite simply, the results of the world’s climate efforts are dangerously inadequate.
According to the Climate Action Tracker, current policies put the world on course to be an alarming 2.7-3.1°C warmer by 2100, relative to pre-industrial levels.
Yes, many emerging green technologies are promising and should be supported.
But in the absence of a global approach, these innovations risk merely redistributing the impact of climate change among countries and regions.
Raising awareness and nudging (and shaming) policymakers is necessary, but not sufficient to avert what UN Secretary-General António Guterres has referred to as a “climate catastrophe.” Climate-change mitigation must be pursued as a global public good.
The problem is that such goods are plagued by collective-action problems, because the costs tend to be spatially and temporally concentrated while the benefits are diffuse.
These difficulties can be tackled only by global governance structures that reduce the cost of collective action, internalize externalities, and counter short-term biases in decision-making.
To address climate change more effectively, we need global governance arrangements that amount to a new global social contract.
Existing international governance structures can serve as a foundation for these new institutions, but will need to be amended and supplemented to address specific problems related to public goods and collective action.
For starters, we need a governance structure whose jurisdiction is limited to global public goods that cannot be provided adequately at the national level.
Nation-states would be free to opt in and opt out, with the benefits of opting in outweighing those of opting out.
Decisions would be taken on a majoritarian basis, with no single country having veto power.
There would also be an appeals and adjudication process that allows decisions to be challenged.
Second, a custodial entity would keep track of global natural wealth accounts to address intergenerational equity issues.
This entity should be able to place items on the global governance institution’s agenda and to appeal decisions.
Lastly, a regime of incentives and disincentives would aim to preserve nature and biodiversity and tax those who consume it, taking wealth and income disparities across countries into account.
Establishing global governance mechanisms that focus on the public-goods and collective-action challenges of climate change will not be easy.
Concerns and fears related to a “democratic deficit” and the need to protect national sovereignty are legitimate, and cannot simply be brushed aside.
Nevertheless, we are not starting from scratch.
The World Trade Organization provides an example of a strong and successful global governance structure with binding rules.
It is thus both ironic and sad that the WTO has failed to incorporate trade-related environmental and human-rights issues into its regulations in order to ensure a level international playing field. After all, with its sanctioning authority, the WTO is best positioned to link issues such as greenhouse-gas emissions and labor rights to trade rules.
Jordan cannot successfully tackle today’s global climate challenges on its own.
Nor can the Middle East, owing to regional conflicts and rivalries.
Now that the world has become a village, the task facing the region is instead to agree with other countries – our fellow villagers – on how to mitigate our own excesses and avert an existential threat.
This can be achieved only by finding suitable ways to hold ourselves and each other accountable. The solution lies in establishing a global governance system that is based on the nation-state but has the capacity to sanction harmful behavior.
Some might regard the idea of creating such a structure as far-fetched.
But unless we do, there is scant hope of preventing the climate crisis – already apparent in Jordan and around the world – from continuing to destroy countless lives and livelihoods.

A New Model United Nations
The award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is a cause for true celebration everywhere.
But celebrations should never become an excuse for complacency.
Yes, the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan's leadership.
But the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains, in many parts of the world and for many of the world's most complex problems, more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality.
Some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest.
Beyond states, the world's many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence, but without formal rules to define their role in the international system.
Their real power, despite Secretary General Annan's efforts to create a dialogue with them, stands outside the UN framework. Indeed, NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak.
To assist them in their tasks, and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide, the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO's are working so impressively.
Such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN's internal structure.
When the UN was founded in 1945, the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III. So, at its foundation, only one powerful body was introduced, the Security Council on which the world's great military powers sat.
The agenda of the Security Council was and remains power, and meeting crises, mostly with military means.
Today, however, the real threats to the majority of the world's population stems from dangers almost unknown back then: poverty, hunger, population growth, migration, the environment, and the like.
For the UN to meet these challenges, its very structure must change.
Two new councils, each with comparable power to the Security Council, are needed: a Social Council and an Economic Council.
The IMF, World Bank, and WTO should not only report to, but be dependent upon this new UN reformed structure.
Why are these new bodies needed?
The world cannot do without rules; it cannot move forward against our age's most pressing problems without defined legal rules and the institutions that regulate international law. Because these institutions do not exist, the UN must now invent them.
Of course some rules, such as rules governing the promulgation of trade sanctions, now exist within, say, the WTO.
These rules, however, are but steps in the right direction: steps toward socially and ecologically sustainable free trade and against protectionism, especially that often practiced by rich countries.
Across the board, more global rules are needed so that global efforts to confront poverty, disease, and mass migration can be made consistent, predictable and most of all effective.
We have the Rome Statute of International Criminal Code; we are heading for an innovative guide to best practice on how civil society organizations can best contribute to the work of the UN; and we now have a large coalition, far beyond NATO, combatting terrorism.
I am grateful that one of the reactions to September 11th was, if I am not mistaken, a somewhat changed attitude within the USA vis-à-vis the UN.
But it is of a paramount importance that these kinds of change, namely, to incorporate real power into the structure of the UN, make more progress.
In dangerous times such as these, the world's peoples need to prove their solidarity.
The large coalition now fighting terrorism is one way to demonstrate this.
But solidarity also must be recognized within the real power structures of the UN.
The Secretary General convocation of a ``Dialogue of Civilizations'' is but a start here.
Far more needs to be done.
The institution of Social and Economic Councils at the UN would mark an enormous step in the right direction.
I have tried to present the ideas outlined here not only to the General Assembly but also to the permanent members of the Security Council.
I have also been invited to present them to the US Senate.
So far, none of those discussions have proved to be very fruitful.
But just as the time is coming when the US will to come see the UN as indispensable, the Security Council and its members will come to see the creation of new bodies within the UN not as rivals, but as the only means for the world's people, in solidarity, to confront the myriad social and economic problems that they face.

From Yellow Vests to the Green New Deal
NEW YORK – It’s old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as “the establishment,” especially the political class.
The “Yellow Vest” protests in France, triggered by President Emmanuel Macron’s move to hike fuel taxes in the name of combating climate change, are but the latest example of the scale of this alienation.
There are good reasons for today’s disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center left and center right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled.
While a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity.
Even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public’s wrath.
By the numbers, France looks better than most, but it is perceptions, not numbers, that matter; even in France, which avoided some of the extremism of the Reagan-Thatcher era, things are not going well for many.
When taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry.
The Yellow Vests’ refrain speaks to their concerns: “The government talks about the end of the world.
We are worried about the end of the month.”
There is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won’t pass muster.
And this is especially true of “trickle down” policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.
When I was at the World Bank, the first lesson in policy reform was that sequencing and pacing matter.
The promise of the Green New Deal that is now being championed by progressives in the United States gets both of these elements right.
The Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources – especially human talent – that can be used effectively.
Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise.
Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.
If the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation.
It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next.
It is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster.
Almost 90 years ago, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression with his New Deal, a bold package of reforms that touched almost every aspect of the American economy.
But it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now.
It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the US, with its crushing unemployment of the time.
Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.
Economists have debated how effective the New Deal was – its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed.
Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.
So, too, for a Green New Deal: It can provide public transportation, linking people with jobs, and retrofit the economy to meet the challenge of climate change.
At the same time, these investments themselves will create jobs.
It has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy.
Of course, some jobs– for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the US – will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.
But to return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter.
It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.
The Green New Deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next.
It can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most – good jobs.
And it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future.
The Green New Deal will have to be broadened, and this is especially true in countries like the US, where many ordinary citizens lack access to good education, adequate health care, or decent housing.
The grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda.
We need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.

The Climate-Change Fight Returns to Paris
PARIS – Nearly two years have passed since France’s then-foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, struck his gavel and declared: “The Paris agreement for the climate is accepted.”
Next week, President Emmanuel Macron and the French government will host world leaders and non-state actors for the One Planet Summit.
The purpose of this gathering is to celebrate climate gains made since 2015, and to boost political and economic support for meeting the goals and targets of the Paris agreement.
The Paris climate agreement, a historic feat of diplomacy that ushered in a new era of international climate collaboration, was facilitated by a number of political and social forces.
One of the most influential of these was a group of more than 100 countries known as the “high ambition coalition,” which helped finalize the deal in the waning days of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21). This diverse coalition of leaders – from the richest countries to the most vulnerable Pacific island states – broke a political deadlock that had impeded climate progress for years, if not decades.
As we reflect on that success, one thing is abundantly clear: the need for ambitious coalitions has returned.
Strong global leadership on climate change scored a diplomatic victory two years ago, and today, new economic and political alliances are needed to turn those commitments into action.
The diplomatic success of the Paris accord is worthy of praise in its own right; it was a remarkable leap forward in the fight against climate change.
But we must not rest on our laurels.
With the United States, the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, dismissive of the accord, the rest of the global community must reaffirm its commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Dramatic, meaningful, and immediate steps must be taken.
The best available science estimates that the world has only three years to begin a permanent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions if there is to be any hope of achieving the Paris accord’s goal of keeping warming to “well below 2°C” relative to pre-industrial levels.
And, whatever urgency science cannot convey is being communicated by the planet itself – through a ferocious display of hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and deadly droughts.
Given the immediacy of the challenge, what can and should be done to avert crisis?
Solutions start with money, and a main objective of the One Planet Summit is to mobilize public and private financing to fund projects that can reduce climate-changing pollution today.
During the summit’s “Climate Finance Day,” companies, banks, investors, and countries will announce new initiatives to help fund the costly transition to a carbon-free future.
Hollow promises will have no place at this gathering; only real commitments of real money for tangible projects will be discussed.
As a result, we hope to see hundreds of millions of dollars committed by governments to fund solutions across all fronts of the climate-change battle.
Plenty will go to renewable-energy projects, but money will also be committed to clean transportation, agriculture, infrastructure, and urban systems.
Funding will also be earmarked for projects that help protect communities that are most vulnerable to the impact of global warming.
The One Planet Summit will be an occasion for countries, companies, and private institutions to forge concrete strategies to shift away from fossil fuels.
At the UN climate talks in Bonn, Germany, last month, 20 countries, led by Canada and the United Kingdom, announced plans to phase out coal from electricity generation.
The gathering in Paris will provide an opportunity for other countries to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which aims to formalize a deliberate transition from coal, and to help companies achieve net-zero emissions.
Ultimately, next week’s summit should be a place where governments, businesses, investors, and other key stakeholders collaborate and share ideas, showcase successful projects, and coordinate goals.
This event should not stand alone, but rather serve as a springboard for international meetings that will take place over the next few years. After all, it is during this short timeframe that the fate of the Paris accord’s temperature targets will be determined.
Two years after the adoption of a groundbreaking climate agreement, global leaders are set to reconvene in the City of Light.
When they arrive, their collective ambition will be needed once more.
This time, however, the goal must be to ensure that past agreements amount to more than just words on a page.

Mosque or Modernity?
PARIS – Whatever happened to the “Arab Spring”?
When demonstrations erupted in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, ultimately leading to the demise of three old and weary dictatorships, no one knew which forces, institutions, and procedures would emerge from the protesters’ demand for democracy.
And yet, despite the unprecedented and unforeseeable nature of events – or perhaps because of it – hope ran high.
What has happened since shows clearly what everyone knew (or should have known) all along: nothing about regime change is simple.
None of the three countries has yet found a stable institutional solution that can defuse intensifying internal tensions and respond effectively to popular demands.
Other countries in the region, including Yemen and some of the Gulf states, have experienced varying degrees of turmoil as well.
Sectarian violence is once again consuming Iraq, while clashes between anti-regime factions in Syria are becoming ever more frequent, with Islamists seeking to gain the upper hand ahead of the political transition that would occur should the government collapse. Even in Morocco, a king with absolute power as Commander of the Faithful has been forced by intense public outrage to move toward a system more inclusive of political Islam.
Likewise, developments in the region’s two non-Arab powers suggest that neither is immune to instability.
In Turkey, recent protests have highlighted growing opposition to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s overweening power and divisive, religious-based social policies.
In Iran, much of the middle class backed the most moderate of the candidates acceptable to the country’s Islamic guardians in June’s presidential elections.
Several related factors underlie the region’s chronic instability.
One is underdevelopment.
While oil has made a few presidents and princes staggeringly rich, the rest of the population has received little benefit.
Hunger is widespread; indeed, poverty and inequality have fueled much of the popular mobilization in the region.
But the region’s protest politics also reflects growing rejection of dictatorship and arbitrary rule.
Despite these countries’ lack of a tradition of open dissent, globalization has made it plain to all that economic development requires regime change.
Finally, political Islam is common to all of the region’s conflicts, and should not be viewed – as it often is – in isolation from these countries’ economic woes.
Simply put, Islam – one of the world’s great religions, practiced by nearly one-quarter of humanity – missed its development takeoff.
There are no easy ways out of underdevelopment without challenging traditional lifestyles, customs, and social relations.
Indeed, religions do not resist the pressures of economic change well.
For Jews, given the absence of a homeland, development occurred among the diaspora, with civil emancipation in Europe giving rise to reformist movements aimed at reconciling faith and modernity. Similarly, Christianity, whether Catholic or Orthodox, blocked economic development for centuries, until internal reformists redefined theological positions on money and banking, the nature of progress, and science and technology.
It is no accident that religious reform in Scandinavia, Germany, England, the Netherlands, and the United States gave rise to today’s global capitalism.
This dynamic extends even to officially atheist China.
Orthodox Communism, a perfect secular simulacrum of religion, has been the primary victim of development since China launched its market reforms in 1979.
Islam also has its reformists.
Consider the mission entrusted to Rifa’a al-Tahtawi, the great Egyptian scholar sent to Europe by Mohammed Ali in 1826 to learn about Western civilization and to try to forge an understanding between it and Islam.
But everywhere in the Arab world, without exception, reformists have been jailed, killed, or reduced to political impotence.
In the absence of an analog to the West’s Industrial Revolution, Muslims (and especially Arabs) have faced multiple humiliations and partial colonization over the past two centuries.
The resulting legacy of grievance, shame, and anger is part of what underpins the region’s current malaise.
Indeed, some of the street demonstrations leave no doubt that many people are moving away from religion altogether.
This is as visible in Egypt and Tunisia as it is in Turkey.
But the grim reality for the Islamic world is that, in times of widespread uncertainty, the forces of tradition tend to speak more loudly and clearly than those of change.
Peace in this huge and strategically vital region – and thus in the world – can prevail only if its countries manage, despite their turmoil, to protect themselves from ideological extremes and political excesses. The importance of this should be abundantly clear to Westerners, whose modern civilization grew out of religious dissent that was initially met by the violence of the Inquisition and the Counter-Reformation.
If Islam, particularly in the Middle East, is on a similar trajectory, long-term instability in the region is all but assured.
Mutual understanding is the only way to moderate the consequences.

Poverty and Terror
Glib assertions that poverty breeds terrorism have been tossed around of late.
Of course, no simple equation between the two can be drawn. Yet, such statements do contain grains of truth.
Poverty may not cause Islamic terrorism, but Islamic terrorists manipulate poverty to their advantage.
Thus, any viable strategy to prevent terrorism must address core issues of economic development.
The first issue to be recognized is that development took a wrong turn about 30 years ago, when OPEC imposed two severe oil-shocks on the global economy.
Developed countries shifted from promoting growth to fighting inflation. World growth slowed dramatically (except in East Asia) and the growth of world trade was halved.
OPEC countries grew rich, while the rest of the developing world struggled with unsustainable trade deficits and indebtedness.
Most experienced negative growth.
During the 1980s and 1990s, half of the IMF's member developing countries endured severe financial crises and were forced to scale back social expenditures so that poverty, inequality and the potential for civil strife increased substantially.
In the wake of this, development policies changed.
America, the IMF, and the World Bank began to emphasize globalization by stressing trade liberalization, restrictive macro-economic policies and the institutional strengthening of markets - the policy package known as ``The Washington Consensus.''
International assistance was recast: development loans became ``structural adjustment loans,'' intended to help heavily indebted developing countries avoid default and made conditional upon countries undertaking reforms favored by the Washington Consensus. Aid fatigue set in and, as the Cold War diminished, official aid flows declined as it was no longer necessary to bribe countries to keep them out of the Soviet camp.
For the average developing country the results were stagnation, widened economic inequalities, climbing unemployment, and increased numbers of poor people. Economic modernization and poverty reduction suffered.
In Africa, per capita GNP dropped at an average rate of .7% annually between 1970 and 1995.
The median rate of growth in developing-country per capita GNP between 1980 and 1998 was 0.0% - no ringing endorsement of Washington Consensus policies.
The 1980s became a lost decade for development.
Of course, some bright spots emerged: ``high-development-level'' developing countries - Taiwan, Korea and most of Latin America - became democracies.
Between 1970 and 1990, the share of trade in GNP increased and the share of developing country manufactured exports rose, except in oil-countries. Chile, China, India and Vietnam increased their growth rates substantially through labor-intensive export-led growth and market-oriented reforms, albeit at the cost of burgeoning inequality.
But poverty was not the only wound inflicted in these years.
Escalating oil-prices created a super-rich feudal aristocracy in the Gulf States.
The gaps between the cosmopolitan oil-sheiks and the disaffected, disenfranchised, and nearly hopeless remainder of the population widened.
Economic modernization was practically non-existent.
Significant increases in education coupled with little modern-job creation and rapid rural-urban migration added to social and political unrest.
The oil-regimes were oppressive, quelled dissent through torture, and were venal and corrupt.
Nonetheless, because of oil, they retained US support. Small wonder some Arab youths became radicalized.
A small band of fiery Imams seized upon this youthful discontent.
Recalling the achievements of Islamic culture during the Middle Ages, they offered a (self-serving) nostrum for lifting Moslems out of dependence, degradation and misery: the reestablishment of theocratic Islamic States that would be more pure and just than secular ones.
Largely unnoticed by the West, they created a fanatical, totalitarian, movement that would stop at nothing, including self-immolation, to achieve its goals.
Who were their enemies?
Modernizing secular leaders (Nasser and Sadat in Egypt; the Shah in Iran); intellectuals who preached of a just secular order and exposed the excesses of the fundamentalist movement (Salman Rushdie); the small moderate Moslem middle class; the feudal, secular elites; infidels (moderate Moslems, Christians and Jews); and foreign powers that supported their enemies.
For several decades, their activities were largely limited to their own countries. When Arab governments clamped down, they exported violence westward.
For now, the terrorist war is the policy response to the spread of Islamic terrorism.
In the long run, something beyond a military response is needed.
I believe that the West can learn a great deal about what to do by studying the policies pursued in the world's only two mid-development Moslem states, Tunisia and Indonesia, because each successfully avoided becoming prey to Islamic fundamentalism.
Tunisia's achievement is noteworthy given its proximity to violence-prone Algeria.
Both countries combined substantial increases in secular education with rapid job creation in manufacturing jobs; stressed rural development and labor-intensive exports; and pursued rapid, egalitarian development.
Egalitarian development of this sort is the only viable answer to the problems of the Moslem world's mal-development.
However, it provides no short-term answer to terrorism for several reasons: it does not supply an ideology compelling enough to compete with fundamentalism, which has captured at least two generations in the Moslem world.
Once radicalized, the genie of violence can rarely be put back into his bottle by civilized means.
Violence arises when there is hope rather than when things are hopeless.
Note that the terrorist leaders are not the poor and uneducated, and that the usual suspects among countries that sponsor terrorism are not the poorest Arab states.
Indeed, 1999, the year before the current Palestinian Intifada erupted, was a good year economically for the West Bank and Gaza.
Sadly, the politics of crackdown appears to be the only immediate answer to terrorist violence.
But if peace, once achieved, is to be maintained, genuine development that is more balanced among different aspects of development, which delivers more benefits to the poor and promotes economic convergence among countries, must become the West's goal. While such policies might take decades to lessen Islamic terrorism, they may prevent radicalization in other developing countries.

Ever Closer Union or Common Market?
BERLIN – At stake in the United Kingdom’s upcoming referendum on whether to remain a member of the European Union is the nature of the EU itself.
The UK wants a different kind of Europe than the one that the EU currently represents.
Its preference is a Europe that essentially consists solely of a common market.
Even though Britain has long been able to opt out of the euro and much else (and thus is not forced in any way to participate in the process of deepening Europe’s political union), this is the ideological essence of the controversy.
It is a question that transcends the UK’s “Brexit” debate.
The growing strength of euroskeptic forces in many EU member states has raised the same issue on the continent, where many believe that the goal of a political union might overburden member states’ citizens and should be abandoned.
Like the British, many Continental Europeans are asking whether transnational regulation by Brussels-based institutions and a political union are actually necessary. Wouldn’t a loose association of sovereign nation-states, sharing the hard economic core of a continental common market – the British model – be enough?
Why bother with all that complicated integration involving the Schengen Agreement, a monetary union, and EU regulations, which in the end don’t work properly and only weaken the member states’ global competitiveness?
Looking at European postwar history, it becomes clear that this debate has been with us almost from the very beginning.
The UK’s focus in the 1950’s and 1960’s was still mainly on the Commonwealth.
The European integration process – aimed at overcoming Franco-German enmity and reconciling West Germany’s industrial potential with European stability (and thus, under the US and NATO security umbrella, excluding the recurrence of war in Europe) – was marginal to its concerns.
After the Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Free Trade Association was established under British leadership a few years later.
EFTA’s aims were a straightforward customs union and a common market, and it was designed from the outset to compete with the EEC, particularly in northern Europe and among the neutral countries.
But it never caught on.
The reason EFTA failed to take hold is instructive: It was based only on economic interests and pursued no further idea.
EFTA had no soul, and that absence rendered it unable to compete with the incipient EU.
Of course, economic interests have been paramount in sustaining the EU’s progress; but the idea of uniting Europe clearly transcended mere economic unification.
It was and still is about overcoming European fragmentation via an integration process beginning with the economy and ending in political integration.
Winston Churchill knew that, as can be seen in his 1946 Zurich speech – well worth reading today – in which he called for a “United States of Europe.”
The EU is Europe’s main historical project.
It has attempted, so far successfully, to learn from centuries of seemingly unending wars, by building a new pan-European system of states that is no longer based on a balance of power alone, but also on overcoming national rivalries by institutionalizing common interests and shared values.
The EU has achieved great things, and this should not be forgotten amid its current crises.
The British error is to assume that one goal, a common market for Europe, can be had without the other, greater political integration, over the long term.
In order to function, a common market requires a substantial delegation of sovereignty and extensive European regulation.
In fact, the EU can ignore neither the nation-states nor the common institutions and policies without putting itself at risk.
Both are its cornerstones.
The EU was characterized by this duality from the very beginning: a confederation with strong integrated federal elements and institutions.
Whoever questions this duality calls the entire system into question, all the more so given that the EU’s current status quo is anything but conducive to enduring stability.
The EU will achieve that only when it has taken the critical step toward a genuine federation.
This is why the majority of EU member states must never abandon the aim of an “ever closer union.”
The UK doesn’t share this aim, and it doesn’t have to share it.
But the future of the EU hinges on pursuing it.
Everything else is a question of pragmatic compromises, for which a good deal of leeway exists.

Lessons from Tiananmen
NEW YORK – It is a chilling thought that exactly twenty years after the “Tiananmen Massacre” few young citizens of the People’s Republic of China have much idea of what happened on that occasion.
Many unarmed Chinese citizens were killed by People’s Liberation Army troops on June 4, 1989, not only in the vicinity of Tiananmen Square, but in cities all over China.
Most were not students, who started the peaceful demonstrations against corruption and autocracy, but ordinary workers, the sort of people a Communist Party ought to be standing up for.
Young people don’t know, because most parents have shut up about it, lest they get themselves and their children in trouble, and because the subject is never mentioned in the official Chinese media; it is a taboo.
Websites mentioning the events of 1989 are closed down.
Emails are intercepted.
People who still insist on talking about it in public are frequently arrested.
Zhao Ziyang was General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1989.
Although no democrat himself, his sympathies were with the student demonstrators.
Because he opposed the hard-liners in his own government, he was put under house arrest until his death in 2005, and his memoirs had to be smuggled out of the country on cassettes, disguised as Peking Opera recordings.
They have just been published in English and Chinese, but cannot be legally distributed in China.
Zhao’s book will doubtlessly inspire more debates on what lessons we should draw from “June Fourth.”
These are necessary debates.
If only they could take place in China.
One strong school of thought that emerged almost as soon as the killing began in 1989, is that the more radical student leaders had been reckless.
It should have been clear to them that a violent crackdown was inevitable.
By provoking the regime, the students derailed any chance of slow political reform, which their more moderate elders had carefully set in train.
Indeed, so proponents of this school often add, China was not yet ready for democracy.
And mass demonstrations certainly were not going to achieve it.
Indeed, the radical student leaders had no more understanding of democracy than the Communist leaders they opposed.
Life in the capital, and many Chinese cities, had been severely disrupted.
The Chinese government was heavy-handed, to be sure, but had a perfect right to restore order in the streets.
If the student leaders had really wanted to take over the government, and use violence to do so, this theory would be convincing.
Violent revolutions are rarely followed by liberal regimes.
There is, however, no evidence that even the most radical students ever had such ambitions, and the demonstrations had been entirely peaceful.
All the demonstrators had asked for was free speech, dialogue with the government, independent unions, and an end to official corruption.
As to whether the demonstrations were doomed to end in failure and bloodshed, this too is easy to say in hindsight.
History may never repeat itself precisely, but certain patterns can be discerned.
Demonstrations alone almost never topple a regime, but they can do so in combination with other political shifts, which can happen suddenly.
When East Germans protested against their Communist autocrats in 1989, they were not assured of success either.
Indeed, some Party bosses wanted to bring out the tanks, just like their comrades in Beijing.
But when Mikhail Gorbachev refused to support a German crackdown, a mixture of overwhelming public protest and government bungling brought down the Berlin Wall.
South Korean students filling the streets of Seoul in 1986 could not have ended the authoritarian military government either.
Again, it was a combination of events – pressure from the United States, the impending Olympic Games, and the presence of plausible opposition politicians – that did it.
The students on Tiananmen Square could not have known what was going on inside the closed Communist regime.
There were serious splits, but no one could have known exactly what the end results would be.
In the event, Zhao Ziyang’s conciliatory approach, which might have led to concessions, which in turn might have opened possibilities for a more open political system, lost out.
Hardliners, who refused to give up their monopoly on power, won.
Would Zhao have prevailed, had the students retreated?
Unlikely.
In any case, it was not the place of the students, or the workers who supported them, to back any particular faction in the government.
They lacked the authority.
They were not politicians.
All they asked for was more freedom.
And this should be the main lesson to draw from those Spring days in Beijing, and Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and many other places: Chinese have as much right as any other people to speak freely, without fear of arrest, to elect their own leaders, and to have laws that apply to everyone, even to the leaders themselves.
On June 4, 1989, thousands of Chinese were killed for demanding less than that.
The best way to remember them is to reaffirm their right to liberties that millions of people, in the West, and in many parts of Asia, take for granted.
The worst way is to blame a few students who insisted on that right until it was too late.

Why Host the World Cup?
NORTHAMPTON, MASSACHUSETTS – Whom would you trust more, Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel?
Whereas Putin is reveling in the attention that Russia is receiving as host of the 2018 World Cup, Emanuel has informed the US Soccer Federation and FIFA that Chicago has no interest in serving as a host city when the event comes to North America in 2026.
Canada and Mexico will each host ten matches, and the United States will host another 60.
So why is the third-largest US city taking a pass?
To understand what it means to host a global sporting event, consider the fact that Putin’s government spent $51-70 billion to stage the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and is projected to spend at least $14 billion hosting the current World Cup, which runs through July 15.
Russia’s budget provided for the construction of seven new stadiums – including one in St. Petersburg that cost around $1.7 billion – and renovations to five other venues. And that does not even account for the additional expenses for training facilities, lodging, expanded infrastructure, and security.
Chicago, having already hosted the opening ceremony and first match of the 1994 World Cup, has adopted quite a different mindset.
Emanuel’s spokesperson, Matt McGrath, recently issued a statement explaining that, “FIFA could not provide a basic level of certainty on some major unknowns that put our city and taxpayers at risk.”
FIFA, McGrath alleges, was demanding something tantamount to a “blank check,” including an “open-ended ability to modify the agreement … at any time and at their discretion.”
Moreover, FIFA would have required that Soldier Field – home to the Chicago Bears football team – be taken out of use for two months prior to the tournament.
In the end, Emanuel’s office concluded that, “The uncertainty for taxpayers, coupled with FIFA’s inflexibility and unwillingness to negotiate, were clear indications that further pursuit of the bid wasn’t in Chicago’s best interests.”
In addition to holding anywhere from two to six games – potentially over the course of a number of weeks – World Cup host cities are expected to throw a “fan fest,” furnish training facilities for the teams, and provide extensive tax exemptions for a range of activities. In fact, FIFA prohibits both direct and indirect taxation on all income from the event, exempting continental soccer confederations, host-country broadcasters, and FIFA member associations, service providers, and contractors.
It is little wonder, then, that Minneapolis and Vancouver have joined Chicago in declining the hosting honor.
To justify its imperious behavior, FIFA points out that, “[the] World Cup is a major sporting event that attracts global attention to the Host Country/Host Countries and provides the opportunity for significant financial investment in sporting and public infrastructure.”
And that added attention and investment, FIFA claims, “may contribute to significant mid- and long-term socioeconomic benefits … as well as economic growth.”
But note the carefully qualified language.
FIFA only goes so far as to promise an “opportunity for significant financial investment” in infrastructure, as well as attention and investment that “may contribute” to growth.
In reality, scholarly evidence shows that the World Cup rarely benefits host countries and cities as much as FIFA would like the public, and public officials, to think.
For example, consider what Russia gets in exchange for its $14 billion-plus investment in this year’s event.
While all of the revenue from ticket sales, international broadcasting rights, and sponsorships will go directly to FIFA, Russia will be left with seven new stadiums and five refurbished facilities that it does not need.
And unless it demolishes these venues, it will have to spend tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain them.
Meanwhile, hundreds of acres of scarce urban real estate will have been forfeited as sites for white elephants.
To be sure, images of sleek new facilities are being disseminated worldwide.
But the optics are not necessarily working in Russia’s favor.
Apparently, there was no hiding the 6,000 empty seats at the Uruguay-Egypt match on June 15.
If history is any guide, it is highly unlikely that the 2018 World Cup will increase Russia’s international investment or trade, boost its tourism industry, or strengthen its people’s commitment to physical fitness.
What it will do is instill a fleeting sense of national pride among a significant portion of Russians, while offering an ephemeral distraction from the country’s mounting problems.
With or without the World Cup, oil-price volatility and international sanctions imposed in response to Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea will continue to darken Russia’s economic prospects and diminish ordinary Russians’ standard of living.
So, whom should you trust?
I’m going with Emanuel.

Why China Won’t Mediate an End to the Ukraine War
CAMBRIDGE – Russian President Vladimir Putin thought he could quickly capture Kyiv and replace Ukraine’s government.
Whether he was misled by poor intelligence or by his own fantasies about history, his “smash and grab” failed in the face of effective Ukrainian resistance. He then turned to a brutal bombardment of cities like Mariupol and Kharkiv to terrorize the civilian population into submission – as he had previously done in Grozny and Aleppo.
The tragic upshot is that Ukraine’s heroic resistance has been accompanied by increasing civilian suffering.
Is there any way to end this nightmare quickly?
One possibility is for Chinese President Xi Jinping to see that he has a “Teddy Roosevelt Moment.”
After the brutal war between Russia and Japan in 1905, Roosevelt stepped in to mediate.
He pressed hard for the parties to compromise and ultimately prevailed, thereby boosting America’s global influence and winning himself a Nobel Peace Prize.
Turkey, Israel, and France (among others) are attempting to mediate in Russia’s current war, but they do not have nearly as much leverage with Putin as his ally Xi does.
The question is whether Xi has the imagination and the courage to use it.
The answer, thus far, is no.
While China has long portrayed itself as a defender of the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, it has tolerated Putin’s brazen violation of the United Nations Charter.
When the UN Security Council voted on a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion, China abstained.
China has criticized Western sanctions against Russia and parroted Russian propaganda about the war being caused by America’s own plans to pursue NATO enlargement, even though it had been clear for years that NATO members were not going to vote to admit Ukraine.
China’s unwillingness to criticize Russia has left it sitting on the diplomatic sidelines, unable to wield influence commensurate with its growing economic and military strength.
Although Chinese censors limit most news about the war, some in Beijing have openly wondered whether China’s current diplomatic stance best serves its national interests.
For example, Wang Huiyao, the president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, has suggested that China should mediate to give Putin an “offramp” from his disastrous Ukraine policy.
Why might this be in China’s interest?
For one thing, China’s current position undermines its claim to be a defender of sovereignty, which it uses to appeal to its neighbors in Southeast Asia.
Equally important, the war is blunting China’s soft power in Europe, which accounts for five times more of China’s trade than Russia does.
The war has also driven up the price of China’s oil and grain imports.
Grain prices will become even more salient if China experiences the same degree of severe flooding that it did last year.
As the war drags on and Western sanctions increase, there is also a danger that secondary sanctions will spill over and harm China.
Providing Putin with a face-saving offramp could address this and the other dangers the war poses.
And it would deepen Russia’s growing dependence on China and boost China’s own global image and standing.
Xi might even win a Nobel Peace Prize.
Of course, there would be costs associated with such an initiative.
Cautious Chinese diplomats see the war in Ukraine as a decidedly European conflict.
If it saps the strength of older powers such as Europe, the United States, and Russia, China can benefit by standing back and letting the conflict burn itself out.
Moreover, although the war is weakening an ally (a potential cost), it also has changed the global political agenda in ways that are advantageous to China.
No longer can the US talk about a pivot to Asia, where it would focus its attention on China.
After the 2008 financial crisis, Chinese leaders concluded that the US was in decline, and this led them to abandon Deng Xiaoping’s patient and cautious foreign policy.
Nationalism has since been rising in the country, and Xi has expressed the hope that China will decisively displace the US geopolitically by 2049 – the centennial of the People’s Republic.
The primary obstacle to Xi’s dream is of course the US, followed by China’s lack of allies other than Russia.
Xi and Putin have forged a personal relationship that has reinforced what was previously an alliance of convenience.
Even if the war in Ukraine has made that alliance somewhat less convenient, Xi may still feel that it is prudent to “dance with the one who brought you to the party.”
Besides, initiating a Rooseveltian move would probably require more imagination and flexibility than the Chinese leadership is capable of.
One also must consider a domestic political element that a Chinese friend recently pointed out to me: With Xi seeking a third presidential term this year, what matters most to him is maintaining the Communist Party’s control of the country and his own control of the party.
As economic growth has slowed, the party has increasingly relied on nationalism to legitimize its rule.
That is why Chinese official media and nationalistic websites have repeated Putin’s claims that Ukraine is a puppet of the West, and that Russia is standing up to America’s bullying of both Russia and China.
Support for Putin’s war is in keeping with China’s nationalist “wolf warrior diplomacy.”
But while Putin’s invasion has upended world politics, it has not changed the underlying balance of power.
If anything, it has slightly strengthened the US position.
NATO and America’s alliances have been reinforced, with Germany embracing a far more muscular defense posture than at any time in decades.
At the same time, Russia’s reputation as a formidable military power has suffered a serious blow.
Its economy is weakened, and its soft power lies in tatters.
China can no longer tout the alliance of autocracies as proof that the East wind is prevailing over the West.
China could still change the dynamic by seizing its Teddy Roosevelt opportunity.
But I doubt that it will.

Evil Personified
COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS – Equating war with individual evil has become ubiquitous – if not universal – in contemporary international politics.
Wars are fights against evil tyrants and the illegitimate governments they control.
Such rhetoric makes wars easier to justify, easier to wage, and easier to support, especially for elected leaders who must respond directly to swings in public opinion. Such language works equally well for any society in today’s media-obsessed age.
Little wonder, then, that political leaders consistently personalize international conflicts.
Alas, such commonplace language also makes wars harder to avoid, harder to end, and arguably more deadly.
The rhetoric of personified evil is easily seen through American examples, but is hardly a uniquely American phenomenon.
Chinese leaders blame Taiwanese leaders for cross-straits tensions, and blame the Dalai Lama for all that ails Tibet.
So, too, have protestors around the world made George W. Bush resemble Hitler, and mullahs throughout the Islamic world ritualistically harangue US presidents as earthly Satans, simultaneously noting their basic affection for the American people.
Recent American leaders, for their part, find it nearly impossible to deploy military force without first employing such rhetoric as both mantra and crutch. The most famous example came in 1917.
Woodrow Wilson, asking for a declaration of war against Germany, said, “We have no quarrel with the German people.
We have no feeling toward them but one of sympathy and friendship.
It was not upon their impulse that their Government acted in entering this war.”
Only the Kaiser and his evil henchmen were to blame.
In 1990, George H.W. Bush made the same plea: “We have no quarrel with the Iraqi people.”
His son said the same thing in 2003, adding, “they are the daily victims of Saddam Hussein’s oppression.”
George W. Bush had earlier noted that Americans “had no quarrel with the people of Afghanistan,” only with Al Queda and their Taliban supporters.
He even employed this phrase in his final State of the Union address in 2008, saying that “Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you….Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so negotiations can begin.”
Every American president since Wilson has, at least once while in office, uttered the phrase “have no quarrel with” a foreign enemy.
Such statements are typically made only days, sometimes hours, before the first American bombs fall.
Bill Clinton promised on the eve of the bombing of Serbia that “I cannot emphasize too strongly that the United States has no quarrel with the Serbian people.”
Barack Obama promised from the campaign trail that “We have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
They know that President Ahmadinejad is reckless, irresponsible, and inattentive to their day-to-day needs.”
Presidents employ such language for good reason.
They know their public, a self-styled melting pot of peoples, would rather fight dictators than brothers and cousins abroad.
Indeed, Wilson’s initial formulation grew from a demographic and political quandary.
More than one-third of Americans in 1917 could trace their heritage back to Germany and its allies.
Wilson could not implore his people to “kill the Krauts,” as British or French leaders frequently did, because so many of Wilson’s soldiers were, by ethnicity at least, Krauts themselves.
He instead rhetorically transformed American soldiers from fratricidal killers into liberators of their ancient fatherland.
Only when foreign enemies looked different from what Americans conceived themselves to be could presidents wage war against a people as a whole.
Thus, Franklin Roosevelt could simultaneously urge Americans to keep the world from being “dominated by Hitler and Mussolini ,” even as he told them that “we are now in the midst of a war against Japan .”
The war in Europe was a war to liberate oppressed peoples from tyrants.
The war in the Pacific was a race war.
Such politically expedient language has a strategic downside.
First, once you pin blame for a conflict on a single individual, a Saddam Hussein or Kim Jong Il, it is difficult to see a solution to international conflict that does not result from the tyrant’s downfall.
Imagine Bush parlaying with Saddam Hussein in 2005 or 2006, if war had never come again to Iraq, after having called him this generation’s Hitler.
More troubling is the identification of conflict with a single human source, which obscures the more systemic and insidious nature of international conflict.
Again, imagine if recent history had gone differently, and Saddam had in fact taken the Bush administration’s eleventh-hour offer of exile rather than war.
Or if the initial attempt made on Saddam’s life in the war’s first hours had been successful.
If Iraq indeed had weapons of mass destruction, as Bush believed, Hussein’s departure would have left such weapons in the hands of…whom exactly?
Equating war with a solitary tyrant thus imposes strategic limitations for policymakers. It also leads, paradoxically, to a greater number of civilian deaths.
Bombs aimed at foreign dictators or their security apparatus almost invariably kill individuals far from the corridors of power.
Their deaths are easier to stomach, and to justify, so long as airmen and soldiers, and the public watching at home, believe the violence was at least directed against evil incarnate.
Such rhetoric clearly works.
It is global in nature.
But it also helps make the world a more dangerous place by obscuring the real reasons for war, and by allowing peoples around the world to justify violence and conflict not as a means to an end, but rather as a holy mission of liberation, freedom, and the eradication of tyranny.
Until political leaders reject the rhetoric of evil as a justification for war, war itself is unlikely to disappear.

The IMF’s Lending Overhaul
The International Monetary Fund should be an essential port of call for emerging-market and developing countries facing financing needs.
With its ability to mobilize large financial resources and buttress policy credibility, the IMF can help mitigate the large economic and social costs often associated with crises.
Against this background, the world has come together in the midst of the crisis to radically overhaul the framework for IMF lending.
Now and in the future, the world needs the IMF to respond flexibly and effectively to its members’ needs. First and foremost, our financing packages should be large enough relative to the size of the problem to make a difference.
In addition, the absence of an IMF insurance facility with acceptable terms has been a major gap in the global financial architecture, especially for the more dynamic emerging-market economies.
This is despite all the evidence of the value of early access to IMF financing, before a tough situation deteriorates into a crisis.
Moreover, while it remains essential to attach policy conditions to IMF-supported programs, they should be focused squarely on solving a country’s critical problems, so that the conditions will be relevant rather than intrusive.
With our members’ support, we are implementing important reforms to our lending policies that will encourage countries to approach the IMF early on, before crises become severe and almost intractable.
The reform comprises three core elements:
First, policy conditions associated with future IMF lending will be better tailored to country circumstances.
A new Flexible Credit Line makes high-volume financing available – even before a crisis has struck – without any ex post policy conditionality to qualifying countries with strong economic fundamentals and policy frameworks. Some observers have dubbed the new facility “EZ loan,” though few countries meeting the qualifying criteria would consider their policy achievements – and their commitment to maintaining that record – anything but “easy.”
For others, conditionality will be more tightly focused on core areas, and “structural” conditions that require hard-to-time legislative measures will be judged in a less formalistic manner.
Second, for those not qualifying for the new instrument, the Fund’s workhorse lending facility, the Stand-By Arrangement, will be made more flexible along several dimensions. These include permitting high financial access even before a crisis materializes, and allowing disbursements to be more front-loaded.
Third, the amount of lending available from the IMF is being raised substantially.
Normal limits on access to IMF resources are being doubled – a development consistent with the growing consensus that the Fund’s lending capacity needs to be at least doubled given the severity of this crisis.
This is extremely important, since few things are as fatal to the credibility of a policy package as insufficient financing.
Taken together, these steps address the core problems – the stigma associated in the past with IMF conditionality, the availability of early pre-crisis financing, and the overall size of rescue packages – that have sometimes diminished the effectiveness of the Fund’s role as a crisis lender. Emerging markets that approach the IMF early on for pre-crisis financing will find shelter from the winds of global deleveraging, which in turn will help contain the spread of the crisis.
The IMF has already moved quickly to help many of our member countries in this time of crisis, including by protecting social spending in order to cushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable.
The lending reforms adopted this week will enable us to be even more flexible and responsive in assisting even more countries.
At the same time, these reforms are only a part of a much larger plan for IMF renewal.
Still in the pipeline are initiatives to increase concessional lending to low-income countries hit by the crisis, to strengthen the Fund’s surveillance and early warning capacity, and to improve its governance structure in ways that recognize the larger role of emerging-market countries in the world economy.
It is my hope that further action in all these areas will be taken in the coming months.
Together, they constitute a turning point in the way the IMF works, and will allow it to serve its global membership even better.

The Fragile Roots of Productivity Growth
How fast is the US economy now growing?
Smart investors are now betting that the most recent economic data will show an annual GDP growth rate of 3% for the second quarter of 2003. They are also betting that the current third quarter may well show a growth rate as high as 5% per year.
July saw American industrial production jump by half a percent, while Intel, the big microprocessor maker, is reporting very strong growth in demand for its key products, suggesting that business investment spending is finally accelerating.
Although Japan continues to stagnate, and Western Europe hovers on the edge of recession, a solid "output-growth" recovery in the US should prove to be a big help in boosting demand in the rest of the world.
But this good news about the US business cycle has been accompanied by bad news about employment.
Hours worked in American business fell at a 2.7% annual rate in the second quarter.
Employment-particularly manufacturing employment-fell in July.
It is very likely that hours worked will continue to fall in the third quarter.
What accounts for this wide divergence?
How can America see reasonably rapid output growth and yet rising unemployment? The answer is that the underlying trend of productivity growth in the American economy continues to be exceptionally positive.
The 5.7% annual productivity gain recorded in the second quarter seems likely to be matched in July-September.
With America's workers producing more in less time, it is no wonder that a wedge is being driven between the (good) output news and the (bad) employment news.
In the short run, rapid productivity growth poses dilemmas for macroeconomic management, because what would otherwise be seen as reasonably strong demand growth is proving to be insufficient to keep unemployment low.
But the short-run view is not the important one.
Rapid productivity growth is-in the long run-good news for America: a higher-productivity economy is better at enhancing human welfare.
In the long run, this is also good news for America's trading partners: there is more value to be gained by trading with a richer economy than with a poorer one.
The continuation of rapid US productivity growth through the recent recession and into the subsequent low-wattage recovery is a very strong piece of evidence that America's long-run rate of GDP and productivity growth has shifted upward permanently, or, if not permanently, at least for a period of time likely to be measured in decades.
America, of course, is not alone among industrial nations that have seen productivity growth accelerate since the second half of the 1990's.
Australia, Ireland, and the Scandinavian countries all had their own sustained bursts of unexpectedly rapid growth.
But the rest of Western Europe and Japan have not.
Western Europe and Japan have vibrant high-tech sectors, able executives, and cultures easily as capable as the US of taking advantage of the boom promised by the rapidly falling prices of information technology.
So you would think that the same productivity revolution would happen in those countries.
Yet there has been no sign of it. Why not?
The current conventional wisdom, most strongly advocated by the American economist Robert Gordon, is that the burst of productivity growth that the US is currently experiencing (and that will turn into a full-fledged economic boom whenever demand growth becomes rapid enough) is due to synergy. According to this view, the US is especially well positioned to benefit from rapidly falling prices of information technology, owing to its openness to competition and new ways of doing business, particularly in distribution.
The comparison between the late 1990's and early 2000's in America and in Western Europe compels us to reflect on how fragile the underlying institutional mechanisms needed to support rapid economic growth truly are.
Western Europe and the US are both post-industrial democracies.
Both possess market economies.
Both have large and powerful social insurance systems.
Of course, institutional differences between America and Western Europe do exist: in the regulation of labor, in restrictions on land-use and redevelopment, in the tolerance of competition authorities for resale price maintenance and related practices. But are these differences really so large as to affect macroeconomic performance so dramatically?
In Robert Gordon's estimation-and in mine-the roots of an economy-wide high-tech productivity boom like the one seen in the US are so delicate that they flourish in American but not in continental European soil.

In Bitcoin We Trust?
LONDON – Many regard the market for Bitcoin – the world’s leading cryptocurrency – as a game of winners and losers played out among hedge funds, amateur investors, geeks, and criminals.
The huge risk inherent in a highly volatile anonymous digital currency is best left to those who understand the game well, or who don’t really care because they can mitigate the risk or absorb any losses.
But Bitcoin recently has become more attractive for countries and individuals with limited access to conventional payment systems – that is, those least equipped to manage the underlying risk.
Earlier this month, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, enacting legislation that will take effect in September.
This means that Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services throughout the country, and recipients are legally obliged to accept it.
Salvadorans are not new to this type of monetary experiment.
The US dollar became legal tender in El Salvador in 2001 and is the currency used in domestic transactions.
At that time, the government of President Francisco Flores allowed the dollar to circulate freely alongside the national currency, the colón, at a fixed exchange rate.
Dollar advocates argued that the expected benefits of macroeconomic stability would outweigh El Salvador’s loss of economic sovereignty, monetary independence, and even seigniorage – the difference between the cost of producing coins and banknotes and their face value. But purchasing power suddenly plummeted and left the economy even more dependent on remittances, which have averaged about 20% of GDP per year over the past two decades.
Using Bitcoin as legal tender will exacerbate the monetary constraints that dollarization revealed – notably, the lack of an independent macroeconomic-institutional framework around which to shape domestic policies. Moreover, Bitcoin is much more volatile than the dollar.
Between June 8-15, its value swung between $32,462 and $40,993, and in the period from May 15 to June 15, it ranged from $34,259 to $49,304.
Such wide fluctuations – and the fact that they are entirely market-driven, with no scope for policymakers to manage the swings – make Bitcoin an unsuitable instrument for macroeconomic stabilization.
El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted that Bitcoin will facilitate remittance transfers and considerably reduce transaction costs. The fees that migrants must pay to send their money home are scandalously high, despite many calls by the United Nations and the G20 to reduce them.
According to the World Bank, the average global cost of sending $200 internationally is approximately $13, or 6.5%, well above the Sustainable Development Goal target of 3%.
Nonetheless, in 2020, low- and middle-income countries received remittances of $540 billion – only slightly less than the 2019 total of $548 billion, and much larger than these countries’ inflows of foreign direct investment ($259 billion in 2020) and overseas development assistance ($179 billion in 2020).
Reducing the fees to 2% could increase remittances by as much as $16 billion per year.
The large but globally fragmented remittance business relies on electronic transfers via commercial banks’ payment systems, and banks charge hefty fees for the use of this infrastructure and the benefit of a safe and reliable international network. But high fees are not the only issue.
Many migrants don’t have a bank account in the country where they work, and their families back home may also be among the 1.7 billion unbanked people worldwide.
Furthermore, some migrants may need to transfer money to countries that either are not integrated into the international payment system or are restricted in their ability to receive cross-border transfers – for example, Syria or Cuba.
Bukele is right about the need to challenge this system, including by providing low-cost and low-risk alternatives.
But Bitcoin is the wrong tool.
Yes, it allows people to transfer value directly and globally, without the costly third-party intermediation.
But its volatility makes it at best an asset – and an extremely risky store of value – rather than a means of exchange.
The risk of a sudden drop in its price means that migrants and their families back home can never be sure about the amount transferred.
Rather than dismiss El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption as just another example of the crypto craze, we should reflect on why many people around the world are willing to embrace cryptocurrencies for non-speculative purposes.
Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that the current international financial system serves them either poorly or not at all.
Innovations in digital money, such as the M-Pesa mobile money service in Africa, have made significant inroads into many developing countries’ payment systems.
But more needs to be done to provide the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to support digital money.
For now, the terrain remains patchy.
Coordinated cross-border policies are urgently needed to ensure that Bitcoin and its variants don’t do more harm than good in developing countries.
Unless both the public and private sectors embrace critical reforms and make basic banking services available to all at low costs, people and governments will increasingly be attracted by Bitcoin and other low-cost, high-risk, and murky alternatives to traditional banking.

Cut Now, Save Later
WASHINGTON, DC – Central banks around the world have finally reacted to the global financial crisis by engineering a coordinated half-point interest-rate cut.
That is welcome, but far more is needed – and quickly.
If implemented now, steep rate cuts can still have a significant positive effect.
If delayed, their effect is likely to be minimal.
Across the board, the world’s major central banks have been slow to respond to the deepening crisis.
This failure reflects the dominance of conventional economics, which has produced closed-minded group-thinking within the global central banking community.
As a result, central banks failed to see the oncoming financial tsunami, and even after it arrived they continued to fight the last war against inflation.
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have been the worst offenders. That is no surprise, as European central bankers are the most conventional in their thinking and have been the most obsessed with inflation.
It also explains why Continental Europe has had such high unemployment rates for so long.
The United States Federal Reserve Board has done a much better job, though it, too, has moved in fits and starts, repeatedly playing catch-up with a crisis that has persistently remained one step ahead of policy.
This pattern reflects the Fed’s own obsession with price stability, which encourages preemptive interest-rate increases to head off inflation, but restrains equivalent preemptive reductions to head off unemployment.
Consequently, the Fed left its interest rate unchanged throughout the summer of 2008, despite the collapse of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, AIG’s insolvency, and the emergence of global financial-market contagion. Moreover, Fed policy remained constant despite rapid deterioration in America’s real economy, indicated by accelerating job losses and rising unemployment.
The coordinated rate cut now undertaken by the world’s major central banks begins the process of policy catch-up, but further cuts are needed.
Whereas the bogey of inflation seems finally to have been laid to rest, another myth must still be challenged – that the Fed and other central banks should save their “bullets” for a rainy day and should therefore resist cutting rates.
There is an old saying about monetary policy being useless in recession because the effect of lowering interest rates is like “pushing on a string.” That happens when confidence and wealth have been destroyed, at which point rate cuts do indeed become useless.
This is because the destruction of confidence undermines the “animal spirits” of capitalism: borrowers are unwilling to borrow and lenders are unwilling to lend.
The destruction of wealth also destroys collateral, which means that even those who wish to borrow cannot.
Meanwhile, insolvencies and foreclosures triggered by excessive interest burdens are not reversed by later rate cuts.
By failing to act in a timely fashion, central banks have allowed a dangerous erosion of confidence and wealth, which is creating “pushing on a string” conditions.
Fortunately, there is still time for decisive rate cuts now to have a robust impact.
But the window of opportunity is closing fast.
If central banks save their “rate cut” bullets for a later day, they may find that their ammunition is useless.
The time to shoot is now.

The Copenhagen-Paris Express
COPENHAGEN – In 2009, when Copenhagen hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference, I was there as a member of parliament, and I had the feeling that I was witnessing a world-changing event.
For years, negotiators had been working toward an ambitious, binding agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, and the world’s attention was directed toward Denmark.
Unfortunately, the global financial crisis and national special interests colluded to derail a comprehensive deal.
Now, climate negotiators are gathering once again – this time in Paris, where expectations for an agreement are equally high.
This time, however, chances are good that a robust deal will be struck.
I will be in attendance, as the Danish minister responsible for climate issues, and I believe that this year’s conference will mark the moment when the world got serious about bringing global warming under control.
The political environment is very different from that of six years ago.
When the conference in Copenhagen took place, the world was still reeling from the near-collapse of global finance, prominent politicians were questioning whether human activity was responsible for climate change, and industry groups were campaigning against binding emission cuts.
Today, the global economy is recovering, climate scientists have dismissed the last doubts about the causes of climate change, and the business community has entered the fight on the side of the environment.
In 2009, green business leaders could be counted on the fingers of one hand.
Today, their ranks have grown into an army.
In November, for example, Goldman Sachs announced that it would invest $150 billion in green energy by 2025.
The dynamics of the negotiations themselves have changed fundamentally.
The goal is no longer to forge an agreement dictating the emission cuts that countries must make; instead, we are developing a framework for reducing emissions that allows governments to decide what their countries can put on the table.
As a result, individual countries are driving the deal forward.
They have realized that the consequences of doing nothing will be dire, and that cutting emissions will pay off over the long run.
Signs of progress are everywhere.
Last year, for example, the United States and China entered into a bilateral agreement to fight climate change.
The US agreed to reduce its CO2 emissions by 26-28% by 2025, and China committed to reaching peak emissions around 2030 and bringing emissions down thereafter.
This new approach has broadly expanded the scope of the climate negotiations.
The agreement in Paris is set to include more than 180 countries, and cover at least 90% of global CO2 emissions.
By comparison, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol covered less than 15% of global emissions.
To be sure, much more can and needs to be done.
Denmark will continue the fight against climate change.
Over the next 25 years, global demand for energy will increase by almost a third, primarily in non-OECD countries like China and India, and we must ensure that this demand is met in as sustainable a manner as possible.
Organizations such as the International Energy Agency could play an even larger role in helping to drive the clean-energy transition.
The international community seems on track to reach the goal agreed to in Copenhagen of mobilizing $100 billion a year in climate financing for developing countries by 2020.
To accomplish this, we will need to harness the power of the marketplace, leveraging public funds to attract private investment.
In this, the Danish Climate Investment Fund, through which the government invests, together with large Danish pension funds, in climate projects for the benefit of Danish companies, could serve as an example for others.
The effort will also involve phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies, as well as developing new financial tools to motivate investors to help solve problems on their own, without relying on public funds.
An agreement in Paris would put in place the much-needed global framework the world needs to reduce total greenhouse-gas emissions.
And while it would by no means mark the successful conclusion of the fight against climate change, it would provide a strong foundation for the global transition to a green economy.

Populism’s Corrupt Core
NEW YORK – Populist electoral victories around the world in recent years have led many to conclude that liberal democracy is under assault.
But the arrest this week of Malaysia’s former prime minister on corruption charges is one of several signs suggesting that widespread predictions of the global demise of liberal democracy are premature.
The implication of the doom-and-gloom view is that liberal democracy’s defenders cannot reclaim the moral high ground until they have reexamined their own political and economic assumptions.
Yet it is a mistake to think that the rise of autocrats is all about ideology, or that it represents a widespread rejection of democracy, liberalism, or human and civil rights.
Today’s elected demagogues are motivated not so much by principle as by power and greed – they are in it for themselves, their families, and their cronies. Restoring balance to our off-kilter world requires that we expose the rank corruption at the heart of the new illiberalism.
In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s friends and family members have grown rich on government loans and public contracts.
In Orbán’s hometown of Felcsút, one crony has overseen the construction of a soccer stadium that seats 4,000 people, even though the total population of the town is just 1,600.
Whereas “corruption before 2010 was rather a dysfunction of the system,” notes the watchdog group Transparency International, “Today, it’s a part of the system.”
In Turkey in 2014, people close to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, including several senior members of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), were implicated in a money-laundering scheme that purportedly sought to bypass US-led sanctions on Iran. The scandal led to the resignation of four cabinet ministers, and to the release of audio recordings in which Erdoğan allegedly can be heard telling his son to dispose of millions of dollars of ill-gotten funds.
But Erdoğan dismissed the allegations as a set-up, and Turkish prosecutors eventually quashed the case.
In Malaysia, former Prime Minister Najib Razak and his associates now stand accused of pillaging more than $4.5 billion from 1MDB, a government investment fund.
According to the US Department of Justice, the pilfered money was used to purchase high-end real estate in Manhattan, mansions in Los Angeles, paintings by Monet and Van Gogh, a corporate jet, a yacht, and other luxury goods.
And in the United States, of course, questions continue to swirl around the private interests of President Donald Trump and his family, and how they may bear on his behavior in office.
The irony is that anger over corruption played a critical role in fueling the current wave of populist autocrats. So, to defend liberal democracy, we must reclaim the anti-corruption mantle.
By redistributing stolen assets from political and corporate thieves and their legal and financial enablers, anti-corruption campaigns do not just hold the powerful to account.
They can also address inequality – and thus the widespread frustration that populists have exploited.
But fighting corruption also means shining a spotlight on – and prosecuting – those who threaten, kill, or otherwise thwart journalists working to expose abuses of power.
Freedom of expression and other fundamental rights are not elitist luxuries, as authoritarians claim.
They are indispensable for safeguarding free societies.
Moreover, a concerted campaign against corruption could serve as a unifying force in countries with deep political divisions.
While a majoritarian government can ride roughshod over the interests of minorities, corrupt regimes steal from everyone.
That is why corruption has provoked mass protests from Bucharest to Brasilia over the past year.
To be sure, those in power can turn anti-corruption campaigns into a political tool.
In China, President Xi Jinping has made deft use of anti-corruption purges to eliminate political adversaries and secure near-absolute power.
But this is all the more reason for proponents of liberal democracy to redouble their own efforts to combat violations of the public trust.
Fortunately, those efforts already have a strong track record.
In the US, four decades of increasingly robust prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act have punished misconduct around the world and recovered billions of dollars in stolen assets.
And despite Trump’s own long-standing criticisms of the FCPA, he has yet to blunt its enforcement activities (though that may yet happen).
Likewise, in France, prosecutors recently charged a former president and a leading business tycoon with large-scale corruption in Africa.
In the United Kingdom, the government has just adopted rules requiring that all British overseas territories – notorious havens for dark money – publicly list the real owners of registered companies by the end of 2020. And in Spain, the long-ruling Partido Popular recently lost a no-confidence vote following a criminal investigation of financial malfeasance that sent its treasurer to prison.
But despite these signs of progress, more action is needed.
Anti-corruption enforcement remains uneven across different jurisdictions.
To address transnational financial transactions, we must build stronger international networks of prosecutors and investigators.
At the same time, more governments should follow the UK’s example, by ending the practice of “beneficial ownership” by secret third parties.
Owners of some of the most expensive apartments in New York City have gone to great effort – much of it legal – to keep their identities hidden, by registering through trusts, limited liability companies, or other entities.
More broadly, public and private donors should bolster their support for civil-society organizations and independent media.
These institutions can track and expose corruption, explain how it implicates powerful political figures, and push state actors to sanction those responsible.
Reining in corruption will not be easy, given that many economies are dependent on investment flows linked to criminal activity.
But the consequences of doing nothing are clear.
Corruption is a primary driver of populism and the retreat from liberal values.
So the next time someone asks you what happened to liberal democracy, tell them to follow the money.

The Red and the Blue
Condoleeza Rice’s replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America’s recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations.
But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans, but for the world.
This year’s presidential vote proves that America’s democracy is healthy, but that some things could be better. Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes.
While some Democrats remain bitter, there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush’s victory.
America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat).
If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote).
The Electoral College was included in America’s constitution to protect small states in a federal system, but it now means that the political campaign focuses largely on the dozen or so battleground states where public opinion is closely divided.
More fundamentally, there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority. So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College.
Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign.
But this should be seen in historical perspective.
In the era of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were extremely partisan, and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language.
For much of its early history – to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction – the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition.
At the same time, despite negative advertising by both sides, the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely viewed.
In general, an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected.
In that sense, what was surprising about Bush’s re-election was how thin his majority was.
In large part, this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War.
Kerry tried to make the war, the low rate of job creation, inadequate healthcare, and Bush’s tax cuts for upper income groups the central issues of the campaign, but some observers felt that this never added up to a clear message.
Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights.
In the end, security and cultural populism trumped economic populism.
Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked (after they voted) about which issues mattered most to them.
The largest number (22%) answered “moral values,” comparison to 20% who cited the economy and 19% who mentioned terrorism.
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term. But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category “moral values” encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public support gay marriage and 35% favor legal civil unions for gay couples (the position advocated by Kerry).
Nonetheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage, particularly in the red center of the country, the issue helped mobilize Bush supporters to come to vote.
A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided.
The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country.
Some call it “Coastopia.”
But the division is not that sharp.
Many states in both camps were won by narrow margins, and if one colors the map at the level of counties rather than states, much of the country looks quite purple. Cities versus suburbs and rural areas is a better description than coasts versus heartland.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes.
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public.
At first, this seems puzzling, because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle.
But many members of Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties, and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries that are dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties.
This tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which attracts viewers by means of contentious “infotainment” programs, and Internet bloggers, who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter.
Reforms to alter the boundaries of Congressional districts to make them more competitive would help alleviate this problem, but few incumbent Congressmen will vote for changes that might increase their risk of defeat.
The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe.
Faced with difficult questions in foreign, fiscal, and social policy, he would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base, but it remains unclear whether the politics of conviction or of pragmatism will prevail.

Let Africa Into the Carbon Market
The G8 summit earlier this year focused on Africa and climate change because the two issues are linked: Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and therefore must be supported to adapt to it.
Adaptation to climate change is critical worldwide, but nowhere as much as in Africa, where exposure to natural disasters is higher than in most other regions. Aside from adaptation, Africa can also play a role in mitigating climate change through more sustainable forest and land management.
Rural populations from Africa have the capacity to compete and export greenhouse-gas emission-reduction credits generated by forestry and agriculture activities that improve their livelihoods, ameliorate local environmental problems, and increase communities’ ability to cope with climate change.
However, in order to fulfill that promise, the industrialized world must give Africa a chance through the emerging international carbon market.
The best approach would be for Europe, Japan, and Canada to buy certificates of biological carbon sequestration from Africa as part of their efforts to meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.
Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries (so-called “Annex I countries”) have the right to purchase certificates of carbon sequestration from reforestation projects undertaken in developing countries and use them to offset up to 1% of their 1990 greenhouse-gas emissions from industry, transport and housing. Although this represents a small fraction of the effort needed from industrialized countries to fulfill the Kyoto Protocol’s goals by 2012, it would help significantly in improving forest and land use in Africa.
Europe, in particular, can demonstrate its commitment to mitigating climate change and promoting economic development in Africa by filling its 1% quota of credits from reforestation projects. This requires modifying some of the rules governing its own internal carbon market, the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS).
Under current EU ETS rules, carbon credits generated by forestry projects undertaken in the CDM currently have no value, despite their obvious climate, environmental, and social benefits.
This is because the so-called “linking directive” – the regulation authorizing EU firms to import Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects – bans credits from any forestry project.
Unsurprisingly, no European firm is currently interested in purchasing such credits. Even European governments, which are not tied by the EU ETS ban, purchase very few.
The EU ETS’s exclusion of carbon credits from forestry projects will remain in force at least until 2008, with the question of whether to include them subsequently set to be revisited next year.
The European Commission will submit a report for consideration by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers by June 30, 2006.
Preserving the European bias against credits from forest projects is not justified, as positive experience emerging from the first land-use projects will show. In the Doha trade negotiations, industrialized nations accepted the need to liberalize their agricultural markets by reducing subsidies to domestic producers and tariff barriers on agricultural imports.
So why not liberalize the carbon market as well – a move that would help, not hurt, domestic producers?
It would also help if all the parties to the Kyoto Protocol amended the post-2012 CDM rules.
In particular, three changes are necessary: the relaxation of the 1% rule, the expansion of eligibility criteria to include more than just reforestation, and the removal of the 60-year replacement rule (which mandates the replacement of temporary with permanent credits after 60 years, regardless of the state of the underlying forests).
The first change would enable Annex I countries to satisfy a greater share of their increasing climate responsibilities using credits from land-use projects implemented in non-Annex I countries.
The second change would allow forestry and land-use projects that are eligible to issue carbon credits to include such activities as re-vegetation, forest restoration, and improved agricultural management. The third change would eliminate a perverse rule, by which parties to CDM contracts can liquidate forests to buy replacement credits.
The responsibility for reforming the emerging carbon market does not lie solely with the North.
All parties to the Kyoto Protocol, including African nations, have a unique opportunity to influence the post-2012 debate and defend the inclusion of land-use projects in the emerging carbon market.

Big Ideas from Small Countries
CAMBRIDGE – Two decades ago, many people thought that the lesson of the 1980’s was that Japan’s variant of capitalism was the best model, and that other countries around the world should and would follow it.
The Japanese model quickly lost its luster in the 1990’s.
A decade ago, many thought that the lesson of the 1990’s was that the United States’ variant of capitalism was the best model, and that other countries should and would follow.
The American model lost its attractiveness in the 2000’s.
So, where should countries look now, in 2010, for models of economic success to emulate?
Perhaps they should look to the periphery of the world economy.
Many small countries there have experimented with policies and institutions that could usefully be adopted by others.
Costa Rica in Central America and Mauritius in Africa each pulled ahead of its regional peers some time ago.
Among many other decisions that have worked out well for them, both countries have foregone a standing army.
The results in both cases have been a political history devoid of coups, and financial savings that can be used for education, investment, and other good things.
A panoply of innovations has helped Chile to outperform its South American neighbors. Chile’s fiscal institutions insure a countercyclical budget.
Many governments increase spending excessively in booms, and then are forced to cut back in downturns, thereby exacerbating the cyclical swings.
There are two key elements to Chile’s fiscal institutions:
● A structural budget balance rule allows deficits only to the extent that the current price of copper is below its 10-year equilibrium or output is below its long-term trend.
● Two panels of technical experts are the ones to judge trends in copper prices and output, respectively, insulated from the political processes that can otherwise succumb to wishful thinking.
These institutions are particularly worthy of imitation by other commodity-exporting countries, in order to defeat the so-called “natural-resource curse.” Even advanced countries such as the US and UK could learn something from Chile, given that in the last expansion they evidently forgot how to run countercyclical fiscal policy.
Singapore achieved rich-country status with a unique development strategy.
Among its many innovations were a paternalistic approach to saving and use of the price mechanism to defeat urban traffic congestion (an approach later adopted by London).
Other small advanced countries also have lessons to offer.
New Zealand led the way for much of the world’s central banks with inflation targeting, along with many liberalizing reforms in the late 1980’s.
Perhaps its Labor Party should be given credit for pioneering the principle that center-left governments can sometimes achieve economic liberalization better than their center-right opponents.
Ireland showed the importance of foreign direct investment.
Estonia led the way in simplifying its tax system by means of a successful flat tax in 1994, followed by Slovakia and other small countries in Central and Eastern Europe and elsewhere (including Mauritius again).
Mexico pioneered the idea of Conditional Cash Transfers (the OPORTUNIDADES program – originally PROGRESA – which was launched in 1998).
CCT programs have subsequently been emulated by many countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.
Mexico’s innovation was really two revolutions in one.
First, there was the specific policy idea of making poverty benefits contingent on children’s school attendance (an idea which has been embraced even in New York City).
Second, and perhaps more importantly, the Mexicans implemented the methodological idea of conducting controlled experiments to find out which policies work and which don’t work in developing countries (which has fed into the exciting Randomized Control Trials movement in the field of development economics).
Also in the 1990’s, largely thanks to the leadership of then-President Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico adopted non-partisan federal electoral institutions that in 2006 proved able to resolve successfully a disputed election.
(By contrast, it turned out in November 2000 that the US had no such mechanism in place, other than the preferences of political appointees.) More recently, the current president, Felipe Calderón, has shut down the entrenched electric utility and pursued much-needed tax, pension, and other reforms.
In highlighting some very specific institutions that could be usefully adopted elsewhere, I do not mean to suggest that they can be effortlessly translated from one national context to another.
Nor do I mean to suggest that these examples are entirely responsible for the economic success of the countries where they are found.
(Indeed, a few of these countries have recently been wrestling with severe problems.)
But a country does not have to be large to serve as a model for others.
Small countries tend to be open to trade.
Often, they are open to new ideas – and freer than large countries to experiment.
The results of such experiments – even those that fail – include useful lessons for all of us.

Explaining China’s Economic Resilience
SHANGHAI – Widespread lockdowns and border closures aimed at combating the COVID-19 pandemic have interrupted global supply chains and largely paralyzed the global economy.
Yet, the real weakness of today’s global economy is not the vulnerability of its globalized production networks, but rather souring attitudes toward globalization – and toward China in particular.
Fear of China’s growing economic clout drives many countries’ foreign-trade and investment decisions these days, and not only in the United States.
Concerns about the dependence of global manufacturing on China have prompted calls to reshore production and cut the country out of global supply chains.
And the US is even threatening to stifle the Chinese economy through technological decoupling.
But China’s critics are mistaken in assuming that the country’s continued economic growth depends almost entirely on the maintenance of the global free-trade system and access to Western technology.
Although China is undoubtedly an important global manufacturer, the real drivers of its economic performance over the last decade or so have been rapid growth in its huge purchasing power and fixed-asset investments – including in the country’s thriving technology sector.
The world has not yet fully appreciated the significance of the country’s inward shift of economic gravity away from “external circulation.”
This is partly because many economists have instead been busy criticizing China’s investment expansion and highlighting the potential debt risks arising from it.
As a result, politicians in America and many other countries still think that the most effective way to contain China is to target its position in global trade and supply chains.
To be sure, China has so far been the largest beneficiary of economic globalization over the past decades, mainly because of its integration into the global free-trade system before and after joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Indeed, by the late 1980s, Chinese policymakers were advocating that the country use global supply chains and international markets to help it industrialize and accumulate capital. China thus took advantage of its abundant cheap labor and adopted a “both ends out” approach, importing parts and components in order to assemble finished products for export.
But Chinese policymakers have long since understood that this growth model could not turn China into a fully developed, high-income economy.
In particular, the severe impact of the 2008 global financial crisis on Western economies forced China to accelerate its “change of focus” by developing a more closely integrated huge domestic market and promoting growth driven by “internal circulation.” Such efforts have gained further momentum in recent years as a result of escalating trade frictions with America, and a recognition that China’s continued economic expansion requires overcoming structural imbalances.
China has taken several steps to correct these imbalances and boost domestic demand.
For starters, it allowed the renminbi to appreciate against the US dollar for at least a decade after 2005, and began to open up its protected market to foreign firms in line with its WTO entry commitments.
The government not only liberalized imports, especially of intermediate and capital goods, but also started allowing foreign penetration in financial markets and other non-tradable sectors. And by establishing an increasing number of free-trade zones, China has honored its commitments regarding foreign-portfolio investment and facilitation of cross-border capital flows.
Second, China has increased physical infrastructure and logistics investments at a rate of over 20% annually over the last 15 years, resulting in new and improved domestic highways, railways, airports, and harbor facilities.
During the last decade, for example, the country has built a high-speed railway network of more than 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles).
Third, since the beginning of this century, the Chinese authorities have consistently supported the construction of large-scale information and communication infrastructure networks, and encouraged private enterprises to innovate in cutting-edge sectors such as mobile payments, e-commerce, the Internet of Things, and smart manufacturing.
This has helped to foster the emergence of many locally based international technology firms, including Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com.
And at the beginning of 2020, the government decided to launch a new round of large-scale investment in 5G base stations.
Finally, the Chinese government has actively promoted national strategic plans aimed at integrating domestic economic mega-regions and generating domestic demand.
This includes the construction of the Xiong’an New Area, where non-core functions of the capital will be moved from Beijing, and which will accelerate the development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei triangle.
In addition, the government has been developing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and is encouraging closer cooperation among 16 cities in the Yangtze River Belt.
The Yangtze River Delta has been leading the economic integration process among mostly industrialized provinces, headed by Shanghai.
Likewise, two of southwest China’s most important urban centers – Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and Chongqing, the main city on the upstream section of the Yangtze River – have been given incentives to create a “double-city circle” through closer economic cooperation.
Furthermore, the freight railway to Europe from China’s west and southwest, and the “new land-sea channel” to the south, will not only boost the mainland Chinese economy but also help to stabilize global supply chains.
Indeed, despite the ongoing shift in its economic gravity, China will certainly not have an incentive to disengage from global technology supply chains or retreat into isolation. On the contrary, it will remain an active participant in and contributor to global trade and investment.
And in opening up more access to its domestic market to foreign investors, China will further support globalization by helping to correct global trade imbalances.
Efforts to stimulate domestic demand will create further expansion and opportunities for domestic and foreign investors, thus boosting future global economic growth.
It is therefore naive to believe that forced technological decoupling, trade sanctions, or forced changes to global supply chains will put an end to China’s future economic expansion.
If critics are too short-sighted to see this, it will be their loss.

Stalking a Killer Fungus
SINGAPORE – Warnings of the rise of so-called superbugs – disease-causing microbes that are resistant to many (or all) antibiotics – have been coming thick and fast in recent years.
What many people seem not to realize is that superbugs are already here – and they are already killing people.
A prime example is Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant fungal infection that is emerging as a serious global health threat.
C.auris was first identified in Japan in 2009, in the ear of a patient who complained of an infection. (Auris is Latin for ear.)
Since then, C. auris has been documented as the cause of wound infections, bloodstream infections, ear infections, and respiratory infections in countries across four continents, including India, Kuwait, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, and countries in South America.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the fungus infected 13 people from May 2013 to August 2016, four of whom have died.
While it remains unclear whether those deaths were due to the C. auris infection or to underlying health conditions, the need to address the scourge of C. auris – which has led to the deaths of up to 70% of those infected – cannot be disputed.
There is evidence that C. auris is spread in health-care settings.
Indeed, the fungus seemed to have a greater effect on people with serious long-term conditions.
As they frequent hospitals, and nursing homes, they come into contact with many health-care professionals, caregivers, and pieces of medical equipment, all of which could spread the fungus onto their skin or into their bodies.
In the United Kingdom, 50 C. auris cases were reported at London’s Royal Brompton Hospital alone from April 2015 to July 2016.
Of the 13 US cases, four – two in Illinois, one in Maryland, and one in New Jersey – occurred at the same health-care institutions at different times, and genome sequencing showed that patients treated in the same hospital in New Jersey had nearly identical strains.
Not only are Candida infections particularly common in hospitals, but their fatality rates also seem to be higher among patients in hospitals and, specifically, intensive-care facilities.
After all, such patients are already in an immune-compromised state, and have been using antibiotics, which can kill off healthy bacteria.
But the main reason C. auris represents such an acute threat is that treatment options are severely limited.
While most C. auris infections are treatable with a class of antifungal drug called echinocandins, some have demonstrated varying levels of resistance to echinocandins, as well as to the other two classes of antifungal drugs, azoles and polyenes.
Even when the drugs do work, they are relatively toxic: azoles and polyenes are nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys), and echinocandins are hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver). Most are also fungistatic, meaning that they stop fungi from replicating, but do not kill them.
And they interact with drugs that patients may be taking for other long-term conditions, such as chemotherapy agents and immunosuppressants.
Moreover, developing new antifungal drugs is not a priority for pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Antifungal drugs are more difficult to develop than antibacterial drugs, because fungal cells are eukaryotic, like human cells, rather than prokaryotic like bacterial cells. As a result, drugs must be selective enough to work on the fungal cells, without damaging human cells.
And, while the global market for human antifungal therapeutics is worth over $6 billion and growing, owing to population aging and growing risks from fungal infections, generic competition is strong.
So even if companies do invest in breakthrough drugs, cheaper options will soon be available, reducing profit margins considerably.
In lieu of effective treatments, controlling the spread of C. auris becomes all the more critical.
This requires, first and foremost, better diagnosis.
C. auris is not easy to identify.
Because biochemical-based tests cannot differentiate between C. auris and other invasive Candida infections, several cases of C. auris were initially misidentified as C. haemulonii.
Many microbiology laboratories currently do not routinely differentiate Candida isolates or use yeast identification methods.
Hospitals and medical centers need molecular techniques to identify C. auris accurately.
Once diagnosed, C. auris patients need to be isolated; medical equipment must be thoroughly disinfected; and strict precautions need to be enforced for health-care workers.
Otherwise, outbreaks among already vulnerable people could become even more common.
The spread of C. auris highlights the need for coordinated local and international public-health initiatives to address the emerging problem of drug-resistant infections in hospitals. If private pharmaceutical companies are not going to invest in the development of novel or more effective drugs and new and better diagnostics, the public sector has to step in.
The rise of the super-fungi must be stopped.

Big Danger at the Lower Bound
CAMBRIDGE – Markets nowadays are fixated on how high the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the next 12 months.
This is dangerously shortsighted: the real concern ought to be how far it could cut rates in the next deep recession.
Given that the Fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2% over the coming year, there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits.
Fed chair Janet Yellen tried to reassure markets in a speech at the end of August, suggesting that a combination of massive government bond purchases and forward guidance on interest-rate policy could achieve the same stimulus as cutting the overnight rate to minus 6%, were negative interest rates possible.
She might be right, but most economists are skeptical that the Fed’s unconventional policy tools are nearly so effective.
There are other ideas that might be tried.
For example, the Fed could follow the Bank of Japan’s recent move to target the ten-year interest rate instead of the very short-term one it usually focuses on.
The idea is that even if very short-term interest rates are zero, longer-term rates are still positive. The rate on ten-year US Treasury bonds was about 1.8% at the end of October.
That approach might work for a while. But there is also a significant risk that it might eventually blow up, just the way pegged exchange rates tend to work for a while and then cause a catastrophe.
If the Fed could be highly credible in its plan to hold down the ten-year interest rate, it could probably get away without having to intervene too much in markets, whose participants would normally be too scared to fight the world’s most powerful central bank.
But imagine that markets started to have doubts, and that the Fed was forced to intervene massively by purchasing a huge percentage of total government debt.
This would leave the Fed extremely vulnerable to enormous losses should global forces suddenly drive up equilibrium interest rates, with the US government then compelled to pay much higher interest rates to roll over its debt.
The two best ideas for dealing with the zero bound on interest rates seem off-limits for the moment.
The optimal approach would be to implement all of the various legal, tax, and institutional changes needed to take interest rates significantly negative, thereby eliminating the zero bound. This requires preventing people from responding by hoarding paper currency; but, as I have explained recently, this is not so difficult.
True, early experimentation with negative interest-rate policy in Japan and Europe has caused some disenchantment.
But the shortcomings there mostly reflect the fact that central banks cannot by themselves implement the necessary policies to make a negative interest rate policy fully effective.
The other approach, first analyzed by Fed economists in the mid-1990s, would be to raise the target inflation rate from 2% to 4%.
The idea is that this would eventually raise the profile of all interest rates by two percentage points, thereby leaving that much extra room to cut.
Several central banks, including the Fed, have considered moving to a higher inflation target.
But such a move has several significant drawbacks.
The main problem is that a shift of this magnitude risks undermining hard-won central bank credibility; after all, central banks have been promising to deliver 2% inflation for a couple of decades now, and that level is deeply embedded in long-term financial contracts.
Moreover, as was true during the 2008 financial crisis, simply being able to take interest rates 2% lower probably might not be enough.
In fact, many estimates suggest that the Fed might well have liked to cut rates 4% or 5% more than it did, but could not go lower once the interest rate hit zero.
A third shortcoming is that, after an adjustment period, wages and contracts are more likely to adjust more frequently than they would with a 2% inflation target, making monetary policy less effective.
And, finally, higher inflation causes distortions to relative prices and to the tax system – distortions that have potentially significant costs, and not just in recessions.
If ideas like negative interest rates and higher inflation targets sound dangerously radical, well, radical is relative. Unless central banks figure out a convincing way to address their paralysis at the zero bound, there is likely to be a continuing barrage of outside-the-box proposals that are far more radical.
For example, the University of California at Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen has argued that protectionism can be a helpful way to create inflation when central banks are stuck at the zero bound.
Several economists, including Lawrence Summers and Paul Krugman, have warned that structural reform to increase productivity might be counterproductive when central banks are paralyzed, precisely because it lowers prices.
Of course, there is always fiscal policy to provide economic stimulus.
But it is extremely undesirable for government spending to have to be as volatile as it would be if it had to cover for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy.
There may not be enough time before the next deep recession to lay the groundwork for effective negative-interest-rate policy or to phase in a higher inflation target. But that is no excuse for not starting to look hard at these options, especially if the alternatives are likely to be far more problematic.

What's Wrong with Europe's Right?
WARSAW: Everywhere in Europe, traditional right wing parties are in crisis.
Britain's Tories appear on a suicidal march to isolating themselves in an imaginary little England.
A civil war grips the French right, with a Euro MP grandson of Charles de Gaulle abandoning the Gaullists to join Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front.
Even Germany's rock solid Christian Democrats are poised over an abyss of scandal.
Only the extreme right-wing Freedom Party of Austria's Jörg Haider is on the march.
Is Europe's right doomed to extinction or extremism?
I am neither a man of the left, nor of the right.
Still, the troubles of the right should worry all thinking democrats; and these troubles are not confined to Europe's western half.
Two years ago I admired the professionalism with which Poland's and Hungary's rightist parties came to power.
Since then, like Western Europe's conservatives, they managed to – at least in political terms – botch nearly everything.
Both movements now garner only around 20% of support in opinion polls.
So-called post-communists are flying high with around 70%.
Perhaps the collapsing popularity of the right in our new democracies tells something about the right in Europe's old democracies.
For like their Western counterparts, the Polish and Hungarian conservatives are caught between their increasingly unappealing neo-liberalism and their increasingly anachronistic communitarian traditions.
Fidesz in Hungary and the Solidarity Electoral Alliance (AWS) in Poland gained power two years ago because of a reaction to their post-communist predecessors.
During their tenures, neither post-communist party rocked the reform boat very much, nor did they threaten democracy.
Yet the voters were ready to move away from the old ties – the electorate had become much younger in the 1990s and the improvements over the old regime, after the recession of the early 1990s had run its course and the reform policies began to pay off, became palpable.
In fact, people may have been somewhat ashamed at having allowed the post-communists to win the second round of democratic elections in mid-1990s.
The right always saw the post-communist interlude as a type of locust years – a time when the seeds of reform withered.
So the rightist rhetoric hardened.
No longer was it neo-liberal.
What we heard was a robust form of Christian conservatism unheard since the days of de Gaulle, Adenauer, and de Gasperi – and the communitarian tone helped sweep the post-communists away.
The right in Poland and Hungary used the communitarian rhetoric of Christian conservatism, but once in power, they reverted to their original programs and governed like neo-liberals.
The outcome was positive economically but a disaster politically.
For people ask: if growth is strong, why is unemployment high? Why are state schools and health services so bad?
Why do we suddenly have an underclass of the kind we used to see in the American cities portrayed in communist propaganda films?
As the rigors of the transition continued, fatigue set it.
And that fatigue with liberal economics found resonance in our memories.
We remember something called "Solidarity," which promised that we were equal brethren; that everyone would be taken care of.
The common good, civil society: all were to be nourished in our post-communist democracies.
Although few seriously question the free market economy and liberal individualism in manners and customs, we feel uneasy about forsaking these values.
Two years ago our new right governments promised to tame the coldness of the market with the warmth of human understanding.
But in keeping to the reform path they failed to discover a language which reconciled their policies with these goals.
Their warmth seemed nothing but political hot air.
The so-called left, both in Poland and in Hungary, has a language which (coming from ex-communists) is breathtakingly cynical, yet effective.
It is a carbon copy of the language of the social-democrats who are so successful in Western Europe.
Because our right-leaning governments have been too decent to use the populist language of the radical right, they are helpless in appealing to mass emotions.
Their words appear to have nothing to do with their deeds.
They talk of family, morality, nation, but their policies lead to NATO, the European Union, massive foreign investment, international capital, and globalization – all things that appear to undermine the communitarian values of the right.
Here our right confronts much the same dilemma as that facing the right in Western Europe – how to bridge the gulf between the market and the community.
Unlike in the English-speaking world, liberalism has never been really popular on the European continent, and the conservatives have always appealed to the patriotic and religious feelings of their supporters.
The traditional right is therefore caught between a populist line that still appeals to the voters and the liberalizing policies that are the stuff of modern government everywhere.
The choice that the Austrian conservatives now face appears to confirm this stark dichotomy.
In this light, Haider may not be a historical leftover somehow unearthed in the mountains and valleys of Carinthia, but an augury of the future of the right across the European continent.
There was much talk recently about the "crisis of the left," as the Labor party in Britain, the Social-Democrats in Germany, and the Democrats in America had to struggle between their old socialist and New Deal traditions and the imperatives of a modern economy, with the fading labor unions and other political bastions of the old left.
The left may have not found any real answers to its predicaments, but through a pragmatic patchwork of policies and rhetoric it managed to reclaim the center stage.
All the while, the seemingly unstoppable march of the market, globalization, and individualism that had propelled the right since Thatcher and Reagan came to an abrupt halt. And the communitarian traditions of the right, with their nationalist past lurking behind, may not be any easier to revitalize than the old fashioned socialism or New Deal populism.
