The Promise of Digital Finance
BERKELEY – An economic development revolution lies literally in the palm of a single hand.
As mobile phones and digital technologies rapidly spread around the world, their implications for economic development, and particularly finance, have yet to be fully realized.
The sooner that changes, the better for people worldwide.
In emerging economies today, two billion people – 45% of all adults – do not have a formal account at a bank, financial institution, or with a mobile-money provider.
The “unbanked” rate is even higher for women, the poor, and people living in rural areas.
Moreover, at least 200 million small- and medium-size enterprises lack sufficient credit, or have no access to credit at all.
Entrepreneurship, investment, and economic growth suffer when savings are stored outside the financial system, and credit is scarce and expensive.
Fortunately, according to a recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), digital technologies – starting with mobile phones – can rapidly fix this problem and foster faster, more inclusive growth.
Mobile phones and the Internet can reduce the need for cash and bypass traditional brick-and-mortar channels.
This dramatically reduces financial-service providers’ costs, and makes their services more convenient and accessible for users – especially low-income users in remote locations.
MGI estimates that if digital finance is widely adopted, it could add $3.7 trillion to emerging countries’ GDP by 2025.
That amounts to a 6% increase above business as usual.
In low-income countries with very low financial inclusion rates, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, and India, GDP could increase by as much as 12%.
Digital finance can boost GDP in several ways.
Nearly two-thirds of the expected growth would come from increased productivity, because businesses, financial-service providers, and government organizations would be able to operate much more efficiently if they did not have to rely on cash and paper recordkeeping.
Another one-third would come from increased investment throughout the economy, as personal and business savings were moved into the formal financial system, and then mobilized to provide more credit. The remaining gains would come from people working more hours – the time they would have spent traveling to bank branches and waiting in queues.
As for financial inclusion, digital finance has two positive effects.
First, it expands access.
In emerging markets in 2014, only about 55% of adults had a bank or financial-services account, but nearly 80% had a mobile phone.
That 25-percentage-point gap could be closed by making mobile banking and digital wallets a reality.
But a gender gap will also have to be closed: worldwide, about 200 million fewer women than men have mobile phones or Internet access.
Second, digital finance reduces costs: MGI estimates that it would cost financial-service providers 80-90% less – about $10 per year, compared to the $100 per year it costs today – to offer customers digital accounts than accounts through traditional bank branches.
Using purely digital channels thus makes it feasible to meet the needs of low-income customers. Financial inclusion becomes profitable for providers even when account balances and transactions are small.
With digital finance, as many as 1.6 billion unbanked people – more than half of whom are women – could gain access to financial services, shifting about $4.2 trillion in cash and savings currently held in informal vehicles into the formal financial system.
This would allow for an additional $2.1 trillion to be extended as credit to individuals and small businesses. Businesses could also save on labor costs, to the tune of 25 billion hours annually, by swapping cash transactions for digital payments.
And governments could take in an additional $110 billion every year – to invest in growth-enhancing public goods like education – because digital channels make tax collection cheaper and more reliable.
New mobile-money services are already demonstrating digital finance’s potential.
In Kenya, M-Pesa – which transforms one’s phone into a mobile wallet – has leveraged powerful network effects to bring about a vast expansion in the share of adults using digital financial services.
That share grew from zero to 40% in just three years, and had risen to 68% by the end of last year.
Traditional financial-services accounts tend to grow at the pace of national income, but M-Pesa’s adoption rate has been dramatically faster, demonstrating that digital finance can achieve significant market penetration rapidly even in the world’s poorest countries.
But such success stories do not happen in a vacuum. For starters, everyone needs a mobile phone with an affordable data plan.
While businesses can help, it is incumbent upon governments and non-governmental organizations to extend mobile networks to low-return areas and remote populations.
Governments must also ensure that networks between banks and telecommunications companies are interoperable; otherwise, widespread use of mobile phones for financial services and payments would be impossible.
Governments must establish universally accepted forms of identity as well, so that service providers can control fraud.
In emerging economies, one in five people are unregistered, compared to only one in ten in advanced economies.
Nearly 20% of unbanked women in emerging countries do not have the documentation necessary to open a bank account.
Even when people have recognized IDs, they must be amenable to digital authentication. Digital IDs that use microchips, fingerprints, or iris scans could prove useful – and are already gaining popularity – in emerging economies.
Finally, governments must implement regulations that strike a balance between protecting investors and consumers, and giving banks, retailers, and financial-technology and telecommunications companies room to compete and innovate.
Because regulations often shut out non-bank competitors, governments should consider a tiered approach, whereby businesses without a full banking license can provide basic financial products to customers with smaller accounts. A good model for this is the United Kingdom’s “regulatory sandbox” for financial-technology companies, which imposes lower regulatory requirements on emerging players until they reach a certain size.
Financial inclusion is vital for inclusive economic growth and gender equality, and it has assumed a prominent role in global development efforts, with the World Bank aiming for universal financial inclusion by 2020.
With billions of people in emerging economies already using mobile phones, digital finance makes this goal achievable.

Paying the Price of Reform
Angela Merkel’s poor showing in Germany’s recent election has now put into cold storage any hope of a serious overhaul of the country’s famously rigid economy.
Tony Blair was waiting for her to help launch a drive to make the current British Presidency of the European Union a historical turning point for the Union’s economy.
Now Blair has no project, and all would-be reformers are most likely downsizing their ambitions. Europe appears to be more stuck than ever.
But is it?
To start with, the private sector is doing well. Technology travels fast and is swiftly adopted.
Firms have responded to inhospitable conditions by cutting workforces and boosting productivity through more capital-intensive production processes and, when needed, by offshoring their capacities.
The laggards are to be found only in the service industry, which is largely insulated from international production chains and even from internal European competition.
More fundamentally, there is no such thing as a “European economy.”
The Union’s 25 member countries are very diverse.
The Nordic countries are high-tech leaders; Spain has slashed its unemployment rate by half (it stood at 25% not so long ago); and the new members from Central and Eastern Europe are cruising briskly along a steady catch-up path.
The really sick countries are three of the EU’s four biggest: France, Germany, and Italy.
But even they have carried out some reforms – not enough and too recently to make a difference yet; nonetheless, they have started to move.
More importantly, no one ignores that the old ways have to go if prosperity is to be maintained.
Except for a fringe of die-hard Marxists – which can still collect up to 10% of the votes – there is a keen sense that deep reforms are needed to come to grip with the high unemployment and poor growth of the last decade.
Continuing budget deficits have visibly failed to deliver what die-hard Keynesians had promised.
These days, no politician dares to suggest that continuing to pile up debt is the way to go, even though few are prepared to articulate a credible plan for fiscal consolidation.
The problem, of course is that the most urgently needed reforms will hurt a lot of people.
Most economists agree that high levels of employment protection merely hold down the creation of new jobs rather than reduce joblessness.
But reducing employment protection scares every worker in the private sector.
This is understandable, given an unemployment rate of around 10% in France, Germany, and Italy; with so few new jobs, becoming unemployed is a major disaster.
To be sure, comfortable unemployment benefits soften the blow.
The problem, though, is that some people have even become addicted; they now aim at living on welfare benefits alone.
This is why economists want to change the unemployment and welfare systems to raise the incentives to go back to work.
Successful experience notwithstanding, most people interpret “incentives” as painful kicks in the butt, and they want none of it.
Then consider these countries’ bloated public services, where jobs are guaranteed for life, promotion is by seniority rather than merit, and customers are seen as a nuisance.
The result is red tape all over and a huge drag on productivity.
Shaping up the public sector is an obvious goal, but civil servants are adamantly opposed to what would in effect mean new and much less attractive work contracts.
Economists know that important parts of the population are bound to lose from reform. Their answer is that more people stand to benefit, and that the benefits far outweigh the costs.
This is true, but it provides little solace for the potential losers.
Reforms are relatively easier in smaller countries, probably because winners and losers are likely to be personally connected to each other as relatives, neighbors, or friends.
In large countries, the fear of being on the losing side is not outweighed by people’s appreciation that the country as a whole will do better.
One solution is just to go ahead and reform anyway, regardless of the resistance.
This is the Thatcher solution, which took almost everyone by surprise.
Angela Merkel was sometimes called the German Iron Lady, and that seems to have scared enough people to rob her of an expected victory. Even if she becomes Chancellor, she has no mandate for deep reform.
Meanwhile, the French presidential hopeful, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was associating himself with Merkel and articulating a bold reform program, suddenly seems weak.
Clearly, if reforms are to be carried out in Europe, something else must be tried.
Here is one idea.
Why shouldn’t winners compensate the losers?
Surely, for example, there is a price tag that can be attached to breaking civil servants’ existing work contracts.
If a fair one-time payment is offered, it is likely to be taken up by a majority of civil servants, and public opinion will frown upon the greedy or lazy ones who turn it down.
It might be expensive to compensate all potential losers, but we must put our money where our mouth is; if a reform is certain to pay off handsomely, it will pay for the buy-offs, and more.
Governments can borrow what they need to pay out now, and service this debt as reforms yield benefits.
Not only is paying up-front against future benefits efficient and fair, but it also can provide strong incentives for policy makers to weed out bad reforms.
If a reform is as good as we think it is, then so is public debt to finance its political acceptability.

Where Women Stand
BERKELEY – Despite a deep recession in 2008 and a slow recovery thereafter, the first two decades of the twenty-first century were generally a time of economic progress in most advanced economies.
Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita GDP in the OECD grew at a compound annual rate of 1.15% between 2000 and 2018, and employment levels steadily increased, hitting record highs in some countries.
But this growing prosperity was not shared evenly.
Real average wage growth in this period was markedly slower than it was between 1995 and 2000, and real median wage growth was slower still. Work became less secure, and poverty rates (even after tax and transfer payments) rose.
Moreover, gender gaps in employment and wages narrowed but remained large, and women continued to confront unique challenges as workers, consumers, and savers.
Consider the track record for women workers.
Total employment across 22 advanced economies was at a record high at the beginning of 2020 (before the COVID-19 pandemic.)
There were 45 million more jobs in 2018 than there were in 2000, and women held around two-thirds of them.
The female labor force participation rate has grown throughout the OECD, with the exception of Norway – where it was already above average – and the United States, where it fell from 60% in 2000 to 57% in 2018.
A comparison of female employment trends in Europe and the US indicates that improvements in paid maternity and paternity leave in Europe have spurred higher female labor force participation, whereas gains in female employment in the US have been held back by the absence of such policies in many states.
More broadly, rising female labor force participation was driven primarily by an increase in “non-standard” employment arrangements such as part-time and independent work.
Both tend to be more family-friendly than full-time employment, but also more precarious, offering lower pay and fewer if any benefits.
From 2000 to 2018, female part-time employment increased by 2.3 percentage points, which is larger than both the 0.7-point increase in full-time employment for women and the 2.1-point decrease in full-time employment for men.
Although work opportunities expanded throughout the OECD, they stagnated or declined for middle-skill, middle-wage jobs, which is one reason why overall wage stagnation has become such a persistent challenge.
Average (mean) real wages grew just 0.7% per year across 22 countries between 2000 and 2018, which was less than half the average annual GDP growth rate (1.6%).
And as of 2017, the median wage was just 81-90% of the average wage across the OECD, reflecting uneven wage growth across income groups.
From 2000 to 2018, the gender gap in earnings narrowed very slowly, and remains substantial in many advanced economies.
The remaining gaps are the result of many factors, including gender differences in the incidence of part-time work and hours worked, and in occupations and senior roles, as well as overt discrimination and implicit biases against women. Still, there is considerable variance across the OECD: in Belgium, women earn 96 cents for every dollar a man earns; in South Korea, that figure falls to 65 cents; and in the US it is 82 cents.
No country has achieved gender parity in wages.
As consumers, women have experienced mixed results.
Like men, they have benefited greatly from a sharp decline in the prices of many discretionary goods and services, including communications, clothing, furnishings, and recreation.
The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that, holding all else constant, people could work six fewer weeks per year, on average, and still consume the same amount of goods and services as in 2000.
Theoretically, this trend should have been particularly beneficial for working women, most of whom suffer from greater time poverty than men, because women continue to bear a disproportionate share of family-care responsibilities. Unfortunately, these potential consumer benefits were more than offset by the rising costs of housing, health care, and education, which have absorbed 54-107% of the average household’s income gains in Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the US.
Not surprisingly, single mothers – who head 60% of all US households living below the poverty line – were the most adversely affected by these trends.
The outlook is also worrying for women as savers.
While real mean individual net wealth recovered to pre-crisis levels in many countries by 2018, real median net wealth did not, leaving lower-income groups worse off.
According to one recent study, although women’s median net wealth is higher overall than it was two decades ago, a large gender gap remains. In the eurozone, women’s median net wealth is 62% that of men.
Moreover, owing to shifts in institutional pension arrangements, guaranteed pensions now cover just ten years of retirement (on average) in the countries studied, even though women at age 65 can expect to live for another 22 years, compared to 19 years for men.
Saving for retirement thus weighs more heavily on women than it does on men.
And while surveys show that women are more likely than men to save, they are also less likely to invest, thereby losing out on potential returns.
As the economic and social conditions facing individuals and households change, so must the social contract between citizens and their governments. The trends identified here suggest a growing need for access to good jobs, essential goods like housing and health care, and adequate retirement income.
For women, recent gains in employment opportunities, wages, and family benefits need to be sustained, and persistent gender gaps need to be closed.
Of course, the COVID-19 crisis threatens to undermine many of the gains and aggravate many of the challenges documented here.
As the advanced economies struggle to respond, the social contracts on which their citizens depend will be rewritten in ways that are difficult to predict.
Whatever form they ultimately take, they must not overlook women workers.

What Asian Century?
PARIS – It is almost taken for granted nowadays that this is to be the “Asian Century,” marking an irreversible political/economic shift in global power from West to East.
China has replaced Germany as the world’s leading exporter, while South Korea’s Korean Electric recently outbid Electricité de France to build three nuclear reactors in Abu Dhabi.
To be sure, Chinese trade statistics do not reflect the imports needed to assemble its exports, and the South Koreans’ reactor will use Westinghouse technology. But Asia’s success should not be undersold, especially when one considers that Asia’s governments have used the recent financial crisis wisely, as an opportunity to reinforce the free market mechanism.
(South Korea, for example, simultaneously helped its poor and deregulated its labor market.)
The United States and Europe have not.
Yet it is premature to proclaim an Asian Century.
Perhaps the coastal areas of South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and China’s eastern seaboard share some common cultural characteristics and a similar economic strategy.
But much of central and western China is mired in poverty; Indonesia belongs to a different world culturally and economically; and India is a very different Asia as well.
Nor does Asia cohere politically; parts of it are democratic, other parts are ruled by despots.
Moreover, there is no “Asian” economic system: China’s state capitalism does not belong to the same category as the private capitalism practiced in Japan and Korea. India remains largely an agricultural economy, dotted with small business and service-sector dynamism.
Asia also has no decision center, nor coordinating institutions comparable to NATO or the European Union.
This is important, because, whereas the West is relatively at peace with itself, Asia is riddled with actual conflicts (within and around Pakistan) and looming ones all around the South China Sea.
Indeed, were NATO and the US military ever to leave Asia, the threat of war would increase, heavily disrupting trade, and Asia’s economic dynamism would not survive.
It is hard to believe in an Asia Century when Asia’s security depends on non-Asian security forces.
Another of Asia’s relative weaknesses comes from its poor record on innovation, a fundamental building block of prolonged economic dynamism.
Chinese exports (up to now) have contained little added value and a lot of cheap manpower, and the sophisticated products that it does produce, such as smart phones, have been conceived in the West. Japan and South Korea are much more creative, but they still often improve products and services initially invented in the West.
Asia’s lagging capacity for innovation is probably rooted in its rote education: Asian students, when they have the opportunity, flock to North American and European universities.
And then they stay: 80% of Chinese students in the US do not return to China.
In many ways, Asia’s undeniable progress reflects its conversion to Western values.
Capitalism, democracy, individualism, gender equality, and secularism are Western notions that have been adopted in Asia.
True, there are backlashes in Asia against Westernization, and some try to promote so-called Asian values, such as the “harmony principle.”
But these attempts are weakened by their underlying political motivation.
The idea of harmony, for example, is a rich philosophical concept in classic Buddhism and Confucianism.
It deserves better than to be dressed up in Communist or despotic garb to block democratization.
One also regrets that not much is done in India to keep alive the philosophy and spirit of Mahatma Gandhi, one of Asia’s few twentieth-century universal thinkers.
The prophecy of an Asian Century also ignores all of Asia’s disorderly and declining nations, such as Thailand and Japan, respectively.
But it cannot rely only on some local economic breakthrough without any broader cultural and strategic underpinning.
The fragility of Asia does not mean that Western domination is guaranteed: with its universities, cultural values, entertainment industry, and strong military, the West keeps an edge, but maybe not forever.
More probably, while we try to compare the relative power of the West and the East, we are clinging to an obsolete vocabulary.
Our criteria belong to the past.
After all, there is no such thing as an autonomous “national economy” nowadays.
Almost all products and services are global.
The more sophisticated a product or service is, the more its national identity tends to disappear.
There are no peculiarly Western or Eastern mobile phones or financial derivatives.
When China buys US Treasury bills, who depends on whom?
Exchange generates interdependence. When Asia grows, the West does not become poorer.
From now on, we progress together, or we do not progress at all.
Similarly, there is no contradiction between the West and Asia when it comes to threats to global security, like terrorism or nuclear rogue states.
Pop culture is perhaps the clearest example of this universality.
Korean rock singers are extremely popular in China.
Are they Korean or American?
More probably, they are global.
So we have not entered the Asian Century; we have entered the first Global Century.
But global civilization is such a new phenomenon that we do not yet fully understand what is happening to each of us: we cling to old concepts in order to describe our emerging world.
It may not be a better world, but it will be a very different one.

Edmund Phelps’s Journey
The winner of this year’s Nobel prize for economics, Edmund Phelps, is a giant in the field.
His contributions have been, and remain, so important as that they have altered traditional ways of thinking.
According to the social science citations index, he ranks well among the most important economists since Adam Smith.
Economists working on the macro economy, its micro foundations, exogenous and endogenous growth theory, the formation of expectations and problems of information and discrimination all refer back to Phelps.
After a brilliant secondary education, Phelps entered Amherst College in Massachusetts without any specific idea about which discipline to embrace or which career to follow.
He was passionate about philosophy but, at the insistence of his father, took classes in economics.
As nearly always happens, Phelps’s choice of vocation came after meeting an important professor, in this case the Harvard economist James Nelson.
After some hesitation, Phelps decided to pursue graduate education.
Paul Samuelson admits that he agreed to do a conference at Amherst with the sole aim of recruiting Phelps to MIT.
But Phelps chose Yale, where he came into direct contact with James Tobin and Thomas Schelling.
He wrote his thesis under Tobin’s supervision.
With Ph.D. in hand, Phelps spent a year at the Rand Corporation in Los Angeles before returning to Yale.
He spent another year at MIT, where he taught with Robert Solow and met Samuelson and Franco Modigliani.
Stints at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University followed.
By this point, Phelps had already acquired an international reputation through his work on the golden rule of capital accumulation (he was 28).
This concept now appears in the toolbox of every economist, is taught in all classes on growth, and serves as a reference in all works on the macro economy.
Later, Phelps developed a long-term growth theory based on education and technical advances.
However, this contribution was so far ahead of its time that the profession did not discover its importance until a quarter-century later, when theorists were developing endogenous growth theories.
Phelps was also 10 to 20 years ahead of the profession when he developed the theories of wage efficiency and inflation targeting, which are now considered to be the state of the art concerning the labour market and monetary management.
In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, Phelps’s encounters with Amartya Sen, John Rawls, and Kenneth Arrow at Stanford revived his philosophical streak.
He had extremely valuable intellectual conversations with Rawls, prompting him to write several essays on the theory of economic justice and publish a book on the subject in 1974 – a book still used today.
Phelps was behind the modern reworking of the macro economy – and, according to Samuelson, the micro economy, too.
His research programme consisted of introducing the imperfection of information and knowledge into economic theory, which he then reformulated, giving serious consideration to agents’ expectations. In Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory , a famous work that he published and to which he made three major contributions, he set the scene for what would become the greatest revolution in economic theory of the last 50 years.
It is to Phelps that we owe the theory of the natural unemployment rate – a cornerstone of modern macroeconomic theory and economic policy that Milton Friedman rediscovered a year later, albeit heuristically.
Phelps was also responsible for the “island parable,” which helped explain why monetary policy can have temporary real effects as a result of imperfect information.
The bulk of Phelps’s current work consists of a new reworking of structuralist theory, in an effort to show how changes in interest rates and asset prices affect the equilibrium unemployment rate over the medium term.
Phelps’s new theory provides a logical backdrop against which we can assess the consequences of fluctuations in share prices, exchange rates, and, more generally, the value of physical assets and human capital under the powerful influence of new technologies and innovation.
These are, of course, the main phenomena that economic theory struggles to explain nowadays.
So it is easy to understand why Phelps still leads the way.
Indeed, we can expect his new theoretical framework to become a reference point in a decade or two.
When recommending an Indian mathematician to a Harvard colleague, Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote that: “scientific geniuses generally have one great idea in their life; he has had two.”
What could we say about Phelps?

From PyeongChang to Peace?
SEOUL – After some two years of rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the reprieve, however brief, that the upcoming Winter Olympics in the South Korean city of PyeongChang promises to bring is more than welcome.
But, with some military experts estimating that the probability of war now surpasses 50%, complacency is not an option.
After years of accelerated missile development, which culminated in successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and, allegedly, a hydrogen bomb last year, North Korea’s nuclear program has become an imminent threat not only to its neighbors, but also to the United States.
The response of US President Donald Trump’s administration – which has included unprecedented saber-rattling on Twitter – has escalated tensions further.
Yet, on January 1, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for better relations with the South, before agreeing to participate in the Olympics.
What accounts for Kim’s sudden extension of an olive branch to South Korea?
Since coming to power in 2011, Kim has been committed to a policy called the “Byungjin line,” which emphasizes parallel goals: economic development and a robust nuclear weapons program.
With one of those goals now ostensibly achieved, Kim has shifted his focus to securing new economic opportunities for North Korea’s sanction-battered economy.
For example, the sanctions imposed in September 2017 on textiles, coal, and other exports are said to have reduced North Korean exports by 90%. According to South Korea’s central bank, North Korea’s economy grew by 3.9% in 2016, but may have contracted in 2017.
Kim now seems to have decided that his best hope for boosting North Korea’s economy, without reversing progress on its nuclear program, is to weaken the international coalition enforcing the sanctions.
His campaign begins with South Korea, where he is attempting to use ethnic nationalism to drive a wedge between that country and its US ally and potentially even to convince it to abandon the alliance altogether. In the longer term, Kim appears to hope that he can convince the international community that it can co-exist with a nuclear North Korea, much as Pakistan did.
But South Korea is unlikely to be fooled so easily.
Since his inauguration last May, President Moon Jae-in has known that he needed to find a way to mitigate the existential threat of nuclear war.
So he decided to treat the Winter Olympics as an opportunity not only to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but also to spur momentum for dialogue on denuclearization.
While the possibility that South Koreans may be drawn into North Korea’s honey trap cannot be ruled out, most Koreans, including young people, have had their fill of the North’s provocations, and are highly unlikely to be seduced by Kim’s charm offensive.
Moon himself made it clear last month that no improvement in the South’s relationship with North Korea will be possible without denuclearization.
Indeed, his efforts to open a dialogue with the North seem to be driven by cool diplomatic realism, not naïve idealism.
As for the US, its take on the intra-Korea dialogue reflects a mixture of skepticism and expectation.
Trump has expressed support for the effort, but Americans remain concerned about any potential strain on their country’s alliance with South Korea.
More dangerous, some US policymakers continue to entertain the possibility of delivering a “bloody nose” strike to the North – a decision that could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
After all, there is no guarantee that North Korea would be able to discern whether it really is a one-time strike, or a declaration of war.
And even if the North could read the Trump administration’s intentions, there is no telling how it would respond.
To help prevent this outcome, and with Kim refusing to discuss denuclearization with his “brethren” in the South (at whom he claims his missiles are not aimed), Moon now must figure out how to build up the intra-Korea dialogue to enable talks between North Korea and the US.
To this end, a quiet meeting between the second-highest officials of the two countries – US Vice President Mike Pence and President of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly of North Korea Kim Yong-nam, both of whom are expected to come to Pyeongchang – might be possible.
But, ultimately, it is Trump who needs to seize the opportunity to initiate talks.
The fact is that, despite their importance, sanctions alone cannot bring about the outcome desired by the US or its allies. Talks are needed, if only to try to find out the North’s true intentions: is its nuclear program a defensive or offensive project?
For that, the Trump administration will need to move beyond the “maximum pressure” promised by its stated North Korea policy, and get started on the “engagement” that it also acknowledges will be indispensable to forging a solution.

Taking Back Immigration
LONDON – Within hours of US President Barack Obama’s re-election last month, a powerful belief took hold: overwhelming support from Latino voters had helped to secure his victory.
Suddenly, the Republican Party, long identified with a hard line on immigration, started talking about the need for comprehensive reform. Pundits argued that if the Republicans resisted reform, they would lose the Latino vote for the next generation, relegating their party to near-permanent opposition status.
That might or might not be true.
But the American election’s implications for immigration run deeper than electoral expediency – with lessons for governments around the world.
The remarkable speed with which anti-immigration positions buckled indicates that what most Americans want, above all, is a rational approach; they want their political leaders to take responsibility for the issue, rather than running away from it.
When it comes to immigration, politicians usually are driven by fear – a tendency that has become even more acute since the onset of the global financial crisis.
The rise of extreme nationalists in places like Greece and Finland has reinforced the belief that talking about immigration, except to argue against it, is politically fraught.
So politicians either address immigration in the context of border security and cultural identity, or they ignore it.
But they might well be misreading their citizens’ concerns.
Voter reaction is often less about disliking immigrants than it is about a profound sense of frustration that governments have failed to create an immigration system that works.
They want a system that allows for the legal entry of needed workers, while preventing illegal entry; clamps down on exploitative employers; and provides resources to integrate immigrants into communities.
Voters might not like that some migrants enter their country illegally.
But many find it equally or even more unconscionable that migrants are forced to live for decades in the shadows – or that children raised by immigrant parents could be deported to countries that they have never seen.
When migration is undertaken in a legal, orderly way, the public supports it.
A recent transatlantic survey by the German Marshall Fund found that, while majorities in all countries were worried about illegal immigration, anxiety about legal immigration was low – with only 26% of European respondents expressing concern, and just 18% doing so in the United States.
Ceding the immigration debate to extremists has abetted another extraordinary distortion: people generally believe that the number of immigrants in their countries is far higher than it actually is.
In the same German Marshall Fund survey, British respondents estimated that 31.8% of the United Kingdom’s population was foreign born; the true figure is 11.3%.
Americans estimated that the US foreign-born population stood at 37.8% – triple the actual proportion, 12.5%. Such false perceptions make it even more difficult to have a reasonable debate about the issues.
Tackling migration-related challenges is necessary regardless of whether one favors more or less immigration.
Today, according to the United Nations, there are 214 million people living outside their country of birth, up from approximately 82 million in 1970.
So, even if not a single new person were to cross a border, the challenges would still be with us.
The reality, of course, is that many countries, especially OECD members, will decide that they need more immigrants as their own populations age and shrink.
This implies that they should figure out how to manage immigration well, rather than outsourcing much of the process to smugglers and extremists.
And, in a world in which nearly half of migrants are now moving from one developing country to another, the problems are no longer confined to the West.
The good news is that there have been important advances during the last decade in managing migration.
For example, policymakers can draw on successful programs to integrate migrant children into educational systems.
They can learn how some countries are successfully matching their businesses’ labor needs with immigrants’ skills.
Developing countries, meanwhile, are getting smarter about how to leverage the $406 billion in remittances that their expatriate citizens will send home this year – by issuing diaspora bonds, for example, or by creating targeted investment opportunities for them.
Many pivotal stakeholders also are advocating for a more rational immigration system.
Labor unions, once known for their skepticism toward immigration, are increasingly in favor of pro-immigration reforms.
In fact, unions were a driving force behind last year’s Domestic Workers Convention, which seeks to protect the rights of the world’s estimated 50-100 million domestic workers.
By supporting smart, progressive reforms, politicians should at least be able to neutralize the issue of immigration on Election Day, if not turn it to their advantage.
More important, electoral politics aside, they would be helping to craft better societies whose politics are shaped by reasonable debate among citizens, not distorted by the community-destroying behavior of smugglers and extremists.
This, after all, is what democratic politics is all about.

Ending “Trickle-Down” Vaccine Economics
LONDON – During the Irish famine in the 1840s, as more than one million Irish citizens died, vast quantities of food were exported from Ireland to Britain.
For the Whig government in London, the defense of commercial interests, the dictates of laissez-faire economics, and political indifference to Irish suffering trumped any obligation to prevent mass starvation by intervening in markets.
The international response to the COVID-19 pandemic bears a discomfiting resemblance to the British response to the Irish famine.
Although science and industry have given us the means to immunize the world, nine months after the first arm was jabbed with a COVID-19 vaccine, rich countries are using their market power to direct doses away from poor countries, placing millions of lives at risk.
Consider some recent actions by the European Union.
Under a contract with Johnson & Johnson (J&J), the bloc has imported millions of vaccine doses from a company in South Africa – a country where a mere 11% of the population is vaccinated and the Delta variant is fueling a surge in cases.
Yet efforts to divert vaccine exports from Europe to South Africa and its neighbors were met with a display of vaccine gunboat diplomacy, with the EU threatening to take action under a clause in the J&J contract prohibiting export restrictions.
The message to the world was clear.
While EU commissioners and political leaders may arrive at UN meetings waxing lyrical about the importance of international cooperation and global vaccine equity, the iron fist of vaccine nationalism is driving real-world policy.
When it comes to weighing African lives against marginal gains in the health of already-protected EU citizens, Africans come in a distant second.
Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown recently highlighted the South Africa example as a “shocking symbol” of global vaccine injustice.
He was right – but the injustice is global.
In a world that has delivered more than five billion doses, over 70% of people in rich countries have now received at least one jab, compared to only 1.8% in the poorest countries.
This is an equity gap that kills.
We know that vaccinations provide effective protection against COVID-19 deaths and hospitalization.
As US President Joe Biden has reminded Americans, this is a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.”
The same is true globally.
Nevertheless, the United States and other rich countries are now preparing to deliver vaccine booster shots to already-protected populations facing marginal health risks, effectively diverting supplies from countries where access to vaccines is – quite literally – a matter of life and death.
The current distribution of vaccines is not just ethically indefensible. It is also epidemiologically short-sighted and economically ruinous.
Leaving large swaths of the world unvaccinated increases the risk that vaccine-resistant viral mutations will emerge, effectively prolonging the pandemic and endangering people everywhere.
Meanwhile, expanding vaccinations would boost economic recovery – adding $9 trillion to global output by 2025, according to an estimate by the International Monetary Fund – and help prevent major reversals in poverty, health, and education.
Basic arithmetic shows that we can vaccinate the world.
Estimates by the data analytics firm Airfinity suggest that around 12 billion vaccine doses will be produced in 2021, with output doubling in 2022.
That’s more than enough to achieve the international target of 40% coverage by the end of this year and 60-70% by mid-2022.
Unfortunately, it is not enough to achieve the targets while satisfying rich countries’ desire to hoard surplus stocks.
With their current contracts, rich countries could achieve full vaccination coverage rates for over 80% of their populations, including boosters for vulnerable people, and have a surplus of 3.5 billion doses, according to the Airfinity data – enough to cover the deficit in poor countries and still leave rich countries with a healthy contingency reserve.
Instead, rich countries are actively undermining international cooperation efforts.
Aid donors have invested $10 billion in the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility, the international program designed to provide vaccines to the world’s poorest countries.
That financing has secured contracts for around two billion doses.
Additionally, the World Bank has provided $4 billion for COVAX and an African Union vaccine-purchase initiative. But COVAX and poor countries are constantly pushed to the back of the line for supplies from vaccine manufacturers for whom rich countries come first, not least because of their governments’ threats to take legal action and impose penalties.
The pandemic has demonstrated that the world needs a more efficient and equitable distribution of vaccine-production capabilities.
Developing these capabilities will require knowledge-sharing, technology transfer, intellectual-property waivers, and long-term investment.
But without immediate and decisive action to replace the trickle-down approach to vaccine provision with market redistribution, John Maynard Keynes’s dictum that “in the long run we are all dead” will have a tragic resonance.
There are three priorities.
First, vaccine delivery must be aligned with the target of 40% coverage in all countries by the end of this year. Rich countries must agree to adjust their own schedules so that vaccine manufacturers can make deliveries for COVAX and developing countries.
Building surplus stocks in rich countries while allowing people to die for want of vaccines in poor countries is indefensible. Aid donors should also provide the additional $3.8 billion in grant financing needed to trigger COVAX options on an additional 760 million doses by the end of 2021.
Second, to meet the international targets, we need to move beyond intermittent vaccine donations to large-scale, coordinated dose-sharing.
The EU, the United Kingdom, and the US should immediately share an additional 250 million doses – less than one-quarter of their collective surplus – through COVAX by the end of September, with a clear schedule for providing an additional one billion doses by early 2022.
Third, beyond vaccine equity, there is an urgent need to strengthen health systems, not just through the provision of medical oxygen, which is in critically short supply, therapeutics, and diagnostic equipment, but also by investing in the health workers and infrastructure needed to get vaccines into arms.
The current gap between funds pledged and funds allocated for this purpose is around $16.6 billion.
Our ability to save lives, restore hope, and rebuild economies shattered by the pandemic is constrained not by a shortage of vaccines or financing, but also by a deficit of justice and international cooperation.
The governments of rich countries often recite the mantra that “no one is safe until everyone is safe.” Their leaders must now act like they believe it.

RUDI DORNBUSCH
Rudi Dornbusch's death on July 25, at age 60, took a great economist and exceptional human being from us.
Rudi was born and grew up in Krefeld, Germany. He was an undergraduate at the University of Geneva and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1971.
He taught at the University of Rochester from 1972 to 1974, before returning to the University of Chicago as Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Business in 1974-75. In 1975 he accepted an offer from the MIT Department of Economics, where he taught until his death.
Both the subject and style of Rudi's early work reflected the influence of his thesis adviser, Robert Mundell.
The topic was exchange rates, output, and interest rates; the style was elegant and deceptively simple, with complex models reduced to the interaction of two curves.
For some time, indeed, such diagrams were known as "Dornbusch diagrams".
Many of these early articles are collected in his classic book Open Economy Macroeconomics , published in 1980.
In 1976, soon after coming to MIT, Rudi wrote his most famous and influential article, "Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics", on the overshooting of exchange rates.
The exchange rate fluctuations that came about following the shift to flexible exchange rates in 1973 were surprisingly large - far greater than fluctuations in domestic prices - and the question was why.
Rudi provided a simple explanation.
Price level and the level of output are "sticky", that is, they change only slowly.
When a shock hits the economy, it is initially absorbed by interest rates and the exchange rate.
Gradually the impact of the shock is transferred to output and domestic prices, and the exchange rate moves towards a new equilibrium.
The "Dornbusch result" is that, in this process, the exchange rate typically overshoots its long run value.
Because it overshoots, the exchange rate fluctuates more than the price level.
As Ken Rogoff, the current IMF chief economist who studied under Rudi, commented on the 25 th anniversary of the article's publication: "The `overshooting' paper ... marks the birth of modern international macroeconomics."
Even as he continued to produce outstanding theoretical articles, Rudi became interested in policy issues.
He became one of the outstanding policy economists of our time, displaying the same rare talent demonstrated in his theoretical work: the ability to extract the essence of a complicated problem and explain it in terms that made it appear simple.
He worked on a range of problems, typically the major international and national economic issues of the day, drawing on his knowledge of economic history to illuminate the present.
For example, he applied the lessons of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire to the break-up of the Soviet bloc.
Among his policy papers, the most famous is a 1994 paper that predicted Mexico's peso crisis, one of many papers on Latin America's economic problems.
Another that warrants rereading is his 1990 paper "Macroeconomic Populism", which accurately depicts a temptation to which policymakers in Latin America and other countries often used to succumb.
As his policy interests grew, Rudi's fame spread.
He was an indefatigable traveller, speaker, and writer, and a frequent columnist.
In his more popular articles, in his columns, and on the podium, his wit and the speed of his mind made him a formidable presence.
He was one of the finest debaters and polemicists in the profession.
He did not shy away from stating his views, often reflecting the advice of Keynes: "Words ought to be a little wild for they are the assault of thoughts on the unthinking".
At various times he was persona non grata to the authorities in a number of countries after characterizing either their policies or their behaviour in ways they did not appreciate.
It did not help that he was more often right than not.
Despite his public persona, Rudi was an excellent confidential policy adviser.
When I was in the IMF, I often called him to discuss a difficult situation.
He would talk as long as necessary, and his advice was always thoughtful and nuanced, providing insights no one else had seen.
For a short time, Rudi thought about joining the Clinton administration.
Fortunately he did not, because he had little patience for bureaucracy, long meetings, and the need to toe an official line.
His comparative advantage was on the outside, where he was free to develop his insights and express his views.
Rudi was also a spectacularly successful teacher.
As a thesis adviser, Rudi had few peers.
Every outstanding American international macroeconomist who went to MIT, among them Jeffrey Frankel, Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld and Ken Rogoff, was Rudi's student.
Outstanding students of Rudi can be found all over the globe, many as policymakers.
In their devotion to their teacher and friend lies the greatest compliment to his teaching and his mentoring.
I had the good fortune to collaborate with Rudi in writing two textbooks and several articles.
One textbook, Macroeconomics , sold well over a million copies worldwide and gave me as much satisfaction as anything I have done in my professional life.
Rudi felt the same way.
Rudi lit up any group in which he participated.
He was among the most talented of men, and the warmest, generous with his time and himself, available for students and friends whenever they needed him.
He fought his terminal cancer for over 18 months, never complaining, always expressing optimism that the latest experimental treatment would work.
When he was finally forced to take to his bed, he said that he hoped his friends would remember him as he had been, not as he was at the end.
That they will.

Too Many Health Clinics Hurt Developing Countries
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE – Donors like the World Bank and the World Health Organization often urge developing countries to invest in national health systems.
But while rushing to construct clinics and other medical facilities in even the remotest regions may seem like a straightforward approach to ensuring universal health coverage, that has not turned out to be true.
The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa highlighted the urgent need for stronger, more efficient, and more resilient health-care systems in developing countries.
But when countries rush to build more clinics, the resulting facilities tend to be hastily constructed and lacking in the equipment, supplies, and staff needed to deliver vital health services effectively.
In my frequent visits to rural areas of my native Sierra Leone, I have seen more than a few health facilities that communities could do without.
A newly refurbished facility in Masunthu, for example, had scant equipment and no water in the taps.
The facilities in nearby Maselleh and Katherie had cracked walls, leaky roofs, and so few cupboards that supplies like syringes and medical registers had to be stacked on the floor.
This situation is the direct result of a piecemeal and hurried approach to investment in health-care infrastructure. At the end of the civil war in 2002, Sierra Leone had fewer than 700 health facilities, according to the 2004 Primary Health Care Handbook.
In 2003, the cash-strapped government decided to “decentralize” various public services to the district level, fueling fierce competition for limited resources.
Local councils, seeking to grab the biggest possible slice of the pie, began to push forward new projects, leading to rapid and uncontrolled expansion of the health system. Today, Sierra Leone – with a population of just seven million – has nearly 1,300 health facilities.
The Ministry of Health has been unable to equip all of these new facilities and cover staff and operational costs, as its budget has not risen to match the system’s expansion.
In fact, very few (if any) of the African countries that signed the 2001 Abuja Declaration to allocate 15% of their budget to health have been able to do so.
Last September, Sierra Leone conducted an assessment of the distribution of public-health facilities and health workers in the country, in order to guide discussions on the Human Resources for Health Strategy 2017-2021.
The results were stark: only 47% of the country’s health facilities employed more than two health workers, including unsalaried workers and volunteers. Seven percent of health facilities had no health workers assigned to them at all – an empty promise in physical form.
This situation is not unique to Sierra Leone – or to Africa.
In Indonesia, the government invested oil revenue in the massive and rapid expansion of basic social services, including health care.
But today an insufficient number of doctors plagues many of these facilities, particularly in remote areas, where absenteeism also is high.
There are many nurses, but most are inadequately trained. Still, they are left to run remote facilities on their own.
Beyond personnel, remote health facilities in Indonesia lack adequate supporting infrastructure: clean water, sanitation, reliable electricity, and basic medicine and equipment.
Decentralized local governments, which have little authority over remote clinics, cannot supervise their activities. Small wonder that Indonesia has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in East Asia.
An excess of poorly equipped health facilities is not only ineffective; it can actually make matters worse, owing to factors like poor sanitation and weak emergency referral systems.
During the recent Ebola crisis, underequipped facilities caused even more deaths, not just among patients, but also among the health workers committed to helping them.
Rather than continuing to pursue the uncontrolled proliferation of poorly equipped and operated health-care facilities, policymakers should consider a more measured approach.
Of course, people living in remote areas need access to quality health care, without having to navigate rough and dangerous roads that can become virtually inaccessible during some periods of the year.
But outreach services and community health workers could cover these areas much more effectively. The value of such an approach has recently been demonstrated in Ethiopia, where health outcomes have improved.
While most of the Sierra Leone facilities were built with donor funds, the government has gone along with plans to accelerate the construction drive.
The government and donors have a joint responsibility to pursue a more cautious approach that guarantees quality service delivery.
At the WHO’s World Health Assembly this month, participants should shine a spotlight on this responsibility and begin to rethink current strategies for achieving universal health coverage.
With a more measured approach, it will take longer to build the same number of clinics.
But more lives will be saved.
And that’s the only indicator that should count.

Investment for Sustainable Growth
NEW YORK – The big disappointment in the world economy today is the low rate of investment.
In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, growth in high-income countries was propelled by spending on housing and private consumption.
When the crisis hit, both kinds of spending plummeted, and the investments that should have picked up the slack never materialized.
This must change.
After the crisis, the world’s major central banks attempted to revive spending and employment by slashing interest rates.
The strategy worked, to some extent.
By flooding capital markets with liquidity and holding down market interest rates, policymakers encouraged investors to bid up stock and bond prices.
This created financial wealth through capital gains, while spurring consumption and – through initial public offerings – some investment.
Yet this policy has reached its limits – and imposed undeniable costs.
With interest rates at or even below zero, investors borrow for highly speculative purposes.
As a result, the overall quality of investments has dropped, while leverage has risen.
When central banks finally tighten credit, there is a real risk of significant asset-price declines.
As monetary policy was being pushed to its limits, what went missing was an increase in long-term investments in high-speed rail, roads, ports, low-carbon energy, safe water and sanitation, and health and education. With budget austerity restraining public investment, and major uncertainties concerning public policy and international taxation hampering private investment, such spending has generally declined in the high-income countries.
Despite US President Barack Obama’s promises of investment in high-speed rail and other modern infrastructure, not one mile of fast rail was built during his eight years in office.
It is time to translate words into action, in the United States and elsewhere, and usher in a new era of high investment in sustainable development.
There are three challenges facing such a strategy: identifying the right projects; developing complex plans that involve both the public and private sectors (and often more than one country); and structuring the financing.
To succeed, governments must be capable of effective long-term planning, budgeting, and project implementation. China has demonstrated these capabilities in the last 20 years (though with major environmental failures), whereas the US and Europe have been stymied.
The poorest countries, meanwhile, have often been told by the International Monetary Fund and others not even to try.
Today, governments will have some help in overcoming at least one of the key challenges.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement will help to guide them toward the right projects.
The world needs massive investments in low-carbon energy systems, and an end to the construction of new coal-fired power plants.
And it needs massive investments in electric vehicles (and advanced batteries), together with a sharp reduction in internal combustion engine vehicles.
The developing world, in particular, also needs major investments in water and sanitation projects in fast-growing urban areas. And low-income countries, in particular, need to scale up health and education systems.
China’s “one belt, one road” initiative – which aims to link Asia to Europe with modern infrastructure networks – will help to advance some of these goals, assuming the projects are designed with a low-carbon-energy future in mind.
That initiative will boost employment, spending, and growth, especially in the landlocked economies across Eurasia. It should even deliver new dynamism to economic and diplomatic relations among the European Union, Russia, and China.
A similar program is needed urgently in Africa.
Although African countries have already identified priority investments for electrification and transport, progress will remain slow without a new wave of investment spending.
African countries’ combined spending on education alone should increase by tens of billions of dollars per year; combined infrastructure spending should surge by at least $100 billion per year.
These needs should be covered mostly by long-term, low-interest-rate loans from China, Europe, and the US, as well as by mobilizing African countries’ long-term savings (through, for example, the introduction of new pension systems).
The US and Europe also need major new infrastructure programs.
The US – where the last big infrastructure project, the national highway system, was concluded in the 1970s – should emphasize investment in low-carbon energy, high-speed rail, and the mass uptake of electric vehicles.
As for Europe, the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe – dubbed the “Juncker Plan,” for Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker – should become the EU’s SDG program.
It should focus, for example, on creating a Europe-wide transmission grid for low-carbon energy, and on a massive increase in renewable-power generation.
To help finance such programs, the multilateral development banks – such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank – should raise vastly more long-term debt from the capital markets at the prevailing low interest rates.
They should then lend those funds to governments and public-private investment entities.
Governments should levy gradually rising carbon taxes, using the revenues to finance low-carbon energy systems.
And the egregious loopholes in the global corporate-tax system should be closed, thereby boosting global corporate taxation by some $200 billion annually, if not more.
(American companies are currently sitting on nearly $2 trillion in offshore funds that should finally be taxed.) The added revenues should be allocated to new public investment spending.
For the poorest countries, much of the needed investment should come through increased official development assistance.
There are several ways to generate that extra aid money via a reduction of military spending, including by ending the wars in the Middle East; deciding firmly against a next generation of nuclear weapons; cutting back on US military bases overseas; and avoiding a US-China arms race through enhanced diplomacy and cooperation.
The resulting peace dividend should be channeled toward health care, education, and infrastructure in today’s impoverished and war-torn regions.
Sustainable development is not just a wish and a slogan; it offers the only realistic path to global growth and high employment.
It is time to give it the attention – and investment – it deserves.

The Last Silovik?
MOSCOW – President Vladimir Putin’s regime is as sphinxlike as any that has ever ruled Russia, and now there is a new mystery afoot.
Is Igor Sechin – perhaps the most powerful of the St. Petersburg siloviki who helped establish Putin’s regime 18 years ago – about to fall?
The siloviki, the grey men who emerged from the security and military apparatus, have ruled the roost in Russia for the last generation.
Sechin had a more substantial KGB career than Putin himself, and has held many of the key posts in his patron’s administration.
Since 2012, he has been CEO of the state-owned oil giant Rosneft, Russia’s third-largest company (after Gazprom and Lukoil), whose board chairman since September is former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder.
Under Sechin’s leadership, Rosneft has become a state within a state, with a quarter-million employees, $65 billion in revenue, and 50 subsidiaries at home and abroad – as many as Gazprom.
And Rosneft, even more than Gazprom, has pioneered the modus operandi of the Putin system since 2004, when it took over the assets of Yukos, following the imprisonment of the company’s head, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Putin opponent, on fraud and embezzlement charges.
Sechin has always had a direct line to Putin.
Many Russians have long assumed that he is also the eyes and ears of the KGB’s successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), in the natural-resource sector, which forms the core of Russia’s economy and is the hub of the country’s corrupt power networks.
Yet, today, Sechin is involved in a very public – and symbolically significant – courtroom fight.
He has been summoned three times by a Moscow criminal court to testify in a case against Alexei Ulyukaev, a former minister of economic development.
But Sechin has consistently failed to appear, with his office recently telling the court that he wouldn’t be available until next year.
Sechin’s excuses for not showing up have been pretty standard: the summons was lost, and his schedule – which included big government trips to Vietnam and Turkey – did not allow it.
But there is nothing standard about a Russian court ordering a figure of Sechin’s stature to testify publicly.
On the contrary, in the world of Kremlin politics, the move is as bizarre as it gets.
It all began a year ago, when Ulyukaev was detained at Rosneft’s Moscow headquarters, where he was allegedly attempting to secure a $2 million bribe from Sechin, in exchange for his support for Rosneft’s planned acquisition of a majority of state shares in Bashneft, a regional oil company.
Sechin had, after a previous conversation on the topic, reported Ulyukaev to the FSB, who were waiting to take the minister into custody.
Yet bribery is how Russia operates, so the decision to pursue a bribery case against a powerful player is never just about the rule of law.
In this case, the real motivation behind Sechin’s decision to go after Ulyukaev is uncertain.
Perhaps he felt that the minister needed reminding of his place in the rigid Kremlin hierarchy.
Or perhaps, as has been rumored, Ulyukaev was working with other officials to rein in Sechin by stopping Rosneft from acquiring the Bashneft shares.
In any case, Sechin’s plan – about which Putin may well have known nothing – soon backfired, as the legal proceedings became public.
Particularly damning, transcripts of Sechin’s secret recordings of his conversation with Ulyukaev – part of a sting operation in which Sechin played a leading role – were disclosed in September.
Sechin called the court’s decision to open the case to the public “professional cretinism.”
He claims that “cases like this should be closed from all sides,” because “they contain state secrets.”
But the truth is that Sechin was both arrogant and a fool to assume that he would not get dragged into the case.
Of course, given Sechin’s role in entrapping Ulyukaev, logic dictates that he should have been the first witness called.
But, in Russia, powerful or famous figures – such as, for example, Khodorkovsky – do not become embroiled in legal cases without the Kremlin’s explicit approval.
No low-level Moscow court judge or prosecutor could possibly have summoned Sechin unilaterally.
So when Sechin was called as the last witness – unlucky number 13 – there was only one logical conclusion: Putin, who has already ousted a number of the leading siloviki who brought him to power, had decided to take Sechin down a peg or two.
The gray cardinal of Rosneft had stepped too far out of line.
As in the Khodorkovsky case, the Kremlin seems to be using the courtroom as a platform for clarifying the positions of the Russian elite.
This is particularly important in the run-up to the 2018 presidential election, not least because it is rumored that Putin is seeking a trusted flunky to take over his post, at least temporarily.
Even if Putin does run again – the more likely outcome, given his penchant for total control – he will be seeking a subservient prime minister.
The current one, Dmitri Medvedev, has been discredited as inefficient and – to a public that views him as a political pygmy – unworthy of the level of personal corruption that has been exposed.
By going after one of Putin’s ministers, Sechin appeared to be flexing his muscles, perhaps believing that this would prove his readiness as a prime-time political player.
Instead, the episode has merely shown, yet again, that there is no real “number two” in Russia; there is only Putin, controlling the FSB, the courts, and the commanding heights of the economy.
Whether Putin decides to remain president or temporarily to fill the post with a puppet, as he did in 2008 with Medvedev, his message could not be clearer: I, and only I, am in charge.

Obama’s Middle East
JERUSALEM – President-elect Barack Obama’s plans for the Middle East, the region where his predecessor’s policies shattered America’s standing around the world as a benign superpower, represent a welcome departure from President Bush’s grand design to redress the region’s ills through “constructive chaos.”
Unfortunately, Obama’s all-encompassing promises might prove to be just as unrealistic.
Obama’s agenda is breathtaking.
It includes extrication from the Iraqi morass and lifting its burden from America’s foreign policy, resolving the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict while confronting the “hawkish” Israel lobby, using dialogue to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions and wean Syria from its radical agenda – thereby dissolving the region’s “axis of evil” (Iran-Syria-Hezbollah-Hamas) – freeing Lebanon from Syria’s grip, and pushing for an Israel-Syria peace.
And you can add to this a reorientation of America’s military effort to the war in Afghanistan.
The magnitude of this agenda must be seen against the region’s depressing legacy.
The entire region is going through a dangerous process of “Somaliazation,” with an expanding chain of non-state agents, mostly radical Islamist groups, challenging the idea of the state almost everywhere.
This is the case in Lebanon with Hezbollah, in Palestine with Hamas, in Iraq with Moqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army and scores of other groups, with the Taliban and tribal warlords in Afghanistan, and with breakaway movements in Pakistan that have been emboldened by Pervez Musharaf’s resignation.
The looming end of President Hosni Mubarak’s long rule in Egypt might lead to the emergence of a formidable bid by the Muslim Brotherhood for power in Cairo, possibly forcing Mubarak’s successor either to reach a modus vivendi or to wage a fight to the death.
Obama may soon learn that his timetable for withdrawal from Iraq is unrealistic.
A rapid American disengagement might ultimately cause the country’s disintegration into fragmented political entities, one of which would likely be an Iran-controlled Islamic republic.
The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan requires a more robust military response, but with the American army bogged down in Iraq and the Western allies reluctant to send additional troops, the country’s dismemberment by local warlords is not a far-fetched scenario. And, with the allies’ military operations eroding President Hamid Karzai’s domestic legitimacy, Obama might consider the advice of French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who warns that the answer in Afghanistan will have to be more political than military.
As for Iran, Obama might have to fall back on a strategy of military pressure sooner than he would like.
As the protracted dialogue conducted by the European Union’s special representative, Javier Solana, on behalf of the Security Council’s permanent members and Germany has proved, Iran has no intention of deviating from its drive to nuclear status.
Unless Obama reaches an uneasy understanding with Russia – which would require revising post-Cold War strategic agreements – the chances of imposing a tight sanctions regime on Iran are slim. The specter of a Middle East nuclear arms race, with Iran’s Sunni rivals in the region – Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others – redoubling their efforts to attain nuclear status, cannot be ruled out.
In the Middle East, Obama faces an almost impossible task of redressing historical and political ills.
Meanwhile, he inherits an America that is no longer an undisputed hegemony, and that, together with its allies, is immersed in the most severe economic crisis since 1929.
Struggling with a crisis that is shaking the foundations of capitalism and the American way of life, and laden with a $10 trillion national debt and a $1 trillion budget deficit, the United States is bound to opt for a realistic foreign policy, one that departs from the haughty disregard for history, tradition, and religion that characterized the Bush administration.
Obama’s ascension to the US presidency represents a revolutionary landmark in America’s history that should not be allowed to fall victim to inflated expectations.
His idealism needs to be tempered by the limits of American power.
The challenge of his foreign policy is not to change the Middle East – this is the long-term task of the region’s peoples – but to redress America’s damaged reputation in the Muslim world.
To achieve this objective requires resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly the Palestinian question.
This is the real wound that infects America’s entire foreign policy, particularly its standing in the Arab and Muslim world.
During his visit to the region last July, Obama vowed to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “starting from the minute I’m sworn into office.”
He cannot lose any time in fulfilling that pledge.
Unlike the insoluble mess that he inherits in the broader Middle East, the road to a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute has already been paved, and no wheels would have to be reinvented.
Leadership and commitment are what is required, and Obama’s “Yes, we can” campaign has already shown that he has both.

Flailing at China
NEW HAVEN – This will be the tenth year that I have taught a course at Yale called “The Next China.” The course focuses on modern China’s daunting economic transitions.
It frames the moving target that eludes US President Donald Trump’s administration, which is taking dead aim at the Old China (a convenient target for a leader who wants to resurrect Old America).
The incoherence of Trump’s trade and economic policies, with all their potentially grave consequences for the global economy, is a destabilizing byproduct of this disconnect.
My course starts with the urgency of the challenges addressed by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s.
But its main focus is how the resulting Chinese growth miracle presents President Xi Jinping with four transitional imperatives: the shift from export- and investment-led growth to an economy driven increasingly by domestic private consumption; the shift from manufacturing to services; the shift from surplus saving to saving absorption in order to fund the social safety net desperately needed by China’s rapidly aging middle class; and the shift from imported to indigenous innovation, which ultimately will be decisive for China’s goal of being a “moderately well-off society” by the middle of this century.
The confluence of these four transitional challenges would be daunting for any country.
That is especially true for China, with its blended political economy – the so-called socialist market system, with an ever-changing balance of power between the Communist Party and a vibrant private sector.
It is a very tricky balancing act, to be sure.
I date the pivotal point on the path from Old China to the Next China to early 2007, when then-Premier Wen Jiabao correctly diagnosed the high-flying Chinese economy of the time as increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable.” The Four Uns, as they famously came to be known, sparked a vigorous internal debate in China that led to major rethinking of the Chinese economic-growth model and a series of new strategic plans and reforms – the 12th and 13th Five-Year Plans (of 2011-15 and 2016-20, respectively) and the so-called Third Plenum Reforms (of late 2013).
Notwithstanding all the criticism of China in the West (to say nothing of the bipartisan political angst now boiling over in Washington, DC), progress on the road to the Next China actually has been quite extraordinary over the past dozen years. The middle-class Chinese consumer has come to life, and the services sector has emerged as an increasingly powerful growth engine.
China’s outsize current-account surplus has all but vanished, a trend that is crucial to the saving absorption that its domestic economy requires.
And the signs of indigenous innovation are everywhere, from e-commerce and fintech to artificial intelligence and breakthroughs in the life sciences.
True, like all sagas of economic development, China’s progress since 2007 has been uneven at times, and new challenges have emerged along the way.
Wen’s Four Uns provide a useful way to frame the pitfalls that still lurk.
Instability remains an ever-present threat, underscored by China’s voracious appetite for debt, which has sparked an aggressive deleveraging campaign aimed at avoiding the dreaded Japan syndrome.
Imbalances persist, underscored by private consumption’s sub-40% share of Chinese GDP – a shortfall that can be addressed only by a more robust social-safety net (especially pensions and healthcare).
Persistent regional disparities, in conjunction with mounting income inequality, are visible manifestations of a lack of coordination. And, of course, despite recent progress in dealing with air pollution, environmental degradation remains central to China’s challenging sustainability agenda.
But the trade conflict with the United States is a new and important sustainability challenge for China.
Despite years of denial, there can no longer be any doubt that the US is pursuing a containment strategy vis-à-vis China.
From an ever-escalating tariff war and the weaponization of trade policy by blacklisting leading Chinese technology companies, to Trump’s “order” to US companies to cease doing business with China and Vice President Mike Pence’s declaration of a new Cold War, the US political establishment has swung dramatically from viewing China as an opportunity to regarding it as an existential threat.
And public sentiment has followed suit. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that fully 60% of Americans had an unfavorable view toward China — up 13 percentage points from 2018 and the most negative assessment of China since the Pew survey’s inception in 2005.
Forget about whether this about-face is justified.
I am less concerned than most about the so-called China threat, but I understand the fear and anxiety that grips the doubters.
The real problem is less the merits of the allegations than the deep inconsistencies of Trump’s policies to address them.
An anger-driven US president doesn’t seem to grasp that bilateral trade implies the possibility of prompt retaliation when one side imposes tariffs on the other. Nor does his administration show any understanding of the linkages between ever-expanding budget deficits, subpar domestic saving, and multilateral trade imbalances.
On the contrary, it has embraced a China-centric bilateral fix for a multilateral problem just when America’s own lack of fiscal discipline virtually assures a widening trade deficit with the world at large.
And rather than view Huawei as a legitimate competitor in 5G telecommunications, Trump wants to put a chokehold on China’s leading tech company.
Never mind the resulting value-chain disruptions, which would do great damage to US suppliers, or that targeting Huawei does nothing to address America’s own glaring lack of 5G capability.
Reminiscent of Don Quixote, Trump is tilting at windmills.
His administration is flailing at antiquated perceptions of the Old China that only compound the problems it claims to be addressing.
Financial markets are starting to get a sense that something is awry.
So, too, is the Federal Reserve.
Meanwhile, the global economy is fraying at the edges.
The US has never been an oasis in such treacherous periods.
I doubt if this time is any different.

Secular Stagnation or Self-Inflicted Malaise?
MUNICH – Almost exactly eight years ago, the Lehman Brothers collapse plunged the global economy into recession.
The interbank market collapsed, and the entire industrialized world was thrown into the worst crisis since the end of World War II.
Though central banks have maintained ultra-low interest rates, the crisis hasn’t yet been fully overcome.
On the contrary, numerous economies, such as the southern European countries and France, simply aren’t making any headway.
And Japan has been on the ropes for a quarter-century.
Some economists believe that this is evidence of “secular stagnation,” a phenomenon described in 1938 by the American economist Alvin Hansen, who drew on Karl Marx’s Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall.
Owing to the gradual exhaustion of profitable investment projects, according to this view, the natural real interest rate has continued to fall. Stabilizing the economy thus is possible only by an equivalent decline in policy interest rates.
In view of the huge credit bubble that preceded the crisis in Japan, the United States, and southern Europe, and the aggressive policies pursued by central banks over the last few years, I doubt that this theory is correct.
In fact, I find it plausible that a very different mechanism lies behind the post-2008 stagnation, which I refer to as “self-inflicted malaise.”
This hypothesis is best understood in the context of the economist Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of the business cycle.
Faulty expectations on the part of market participants regularly cause credit and asset-price bubbles.
Investors, expecting prices and incomes to rise, purchase residential and commercial properties, and they take chances on new business ventures.
Real-estate prices start to rise, a construction boom occurs, and a new phase of rapid expansion begins, partly sustained by the revitalization of the domestic economy, including services.
The growth in incomes increasingly emboldens borrowers, which further heats things up.
Then the bubble bursts.
Investment collapses and real-estate prices fall; businesses and banks go bankrupt; factories and residential buildings are vacated; and employees are laid off.
Once prices and wages have fallen, new investors step in with new business ideas and establish new firms.
After this “creative destruction,” a new phase of rapid expansion sets in.
In the current crisis, however, monetary policy preempted the creative destruction that could have formed the basis for a new upswing in growth.
Asset holders talked central bankers into believing that Schumpeter’s economic cycle could be overcome by large-scale bond purchases financed via the printing press, and by corresponding interest-rate reductions.
To be sure, these measures stopped the fall in asset prices halfway and thus saved much wealth. But they also prevented sufficient numbers of young entrepreneurs and investors from risking a new start.
Instead, established firms remained in place, keeping themselves afloat but lacking the wherewithal for new investments.
In Japan and Europe, in particular, large numbers of such zombie firms and banks survived, and they are now blocking would-be competitors able to drive the next upswing in growth.
The resulting economic ossification looks like the secular stagnation that Hansen described; in fact, the malaise is self-inflicted.
And, because low interest rates have reduced asset managers’ returns, some central banks – and the European Central Bank, in particular – have relied on successive interest-rate cuts in an effort to engineer ersatz value gains for assets.
The economy is thus caught in a trap, forcing the ECB to engage in ever more radical monetary-policy measures.
Its current program of quantitative easing is meant to double the money supply in a very short period.
Further guns are being moved into position, such as successively more negative nominal interest rates or so-called helicopter money.
The only way out of the trap is a hefty dose of creative destruction, which in Europe would have to be accompanied by debt relief and exits from the eurozone, with subsequent currency devaluations.
The shock would be painful for the incumbent wealth owners, but, after a rapid decline in the dollar values of asset prices, including land and real estate, new businesses and investment projects would soon have room to grow, and new jobs would be created.
The natural return on investment would again be high, meaning that the economy could expand once again at normal interest rates. The sooner this purge is allowed to take place, the milder it will be, and the sooner Europeans and others will be able to breathe easy again.

Europe’s Ukrainian Soul
BERLIN – This November marks the first anniversary of the Euromaidan uprising in Kyiv.
Large parts of Ukraine’s population – and young people in particular – rose in opposition to then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s refusal to sign the country’s European Union association agreement (finalized after many years of negotiations), in favor of joining a customs union with Russia.
This would have amounted to an eastward shift for Ukraine, with accession to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Eurasian Union ruling out any possibility of ever joining the EU.
In view of Ukraine’s ongoing crisis, this starting point – the first pro-European revolution in the twenty-first century, brought about by opposition to Russian influence and post-Soviet corruption and inefficiency – is important to bear in mind.
A lot has happened since: Russia launched an undeclared war, first occupying and then annexing Crimea.
In eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin continued the war – which, in military terms, seems unwinnable for the Kyiv authorities – in the Donbas region.
Russia’s aim is not to occupy Ukraine militarily, but to prevent political and economic stabilization – a strategy that could include the de facto secession of significant parts of eastern Ukraine.
Moreover, Putin will use the full range of tools at his disposal – including, of course, energy supplies – to pressure and extort Ukraine this winter.
Europeans should brace themselves for what is coming.
Putin believes that time is on his side; he is convinced that he will still be in office when all of his Western foils – Obama, Cameron, Hollande, and Merkel – have long since passed from the political scene.
In military terms, Ukraine has never stood a chance against the Russian army and never will.
But the country’s fate will be decided not only on the battlefield, but also on economic, legal, administrative, and political terrain.
The fateful question is whether Ukraine, under the enormous pressure of military aggression by a much larger and stronger neighbor, can successfully become more European.
Put bluntly: either the country succeeds in emulating Poland’s successful shift toward Europe, or it will once again fall under long-term Russian influence.
For Europe, Ukraine’s fate is a vital strategic question, because its independence has been the cornerstone of the post-Cold War European order and its framework for peace.
Ukraine’s subjugation to Russia by military force would bring down the curtain on that order and its underlying principles: non-violence, the inviolability of borders, and popular self-determination, rather than spheres of influence.
This would entail enormous consequences for the security not just of Eastern Europe, but also of the continent as a whole.
A revanchist Russia would once again – beyond Kaliningrad and the Baltic states – have a long joint border with the EU, and would seek a different, significantly more assertive role: that of a re-established great European power.
For Europe, this would be a fundamental change for the worse.
Cooperation would be replaced by confrontation, trust by distrust, and arms control by re-armament.
If the EU and its members (with the exception of Poland and the Baltic states) can be faulted, it is not because they negotiated a free-trade agreement with Ukraine, but because they ignored Ukraine’s importance to the post-Cold War European order, reflected in insufficient support for the country’s modernization.
Western politicians should have recognized that Ukraine’s Orange Revolution in 2004, triggered by Yanukovych’s attempt to steal the presidential election that year, was both a warning and an opportunity, because the very same aims and principles being fought for today were at stake then.
In the end, the Orange Revolution failed, because the new leadership lacked the ability and incentive to implement far-reaching economic and other domestic reforms, partly owing to the West’s lack of interest.
With the approach of winter, the Euromaidan revolution has once again reached this point, and the challenge is the same now as it was a decade ago.
Will the West provide the generous and energetic help that Ukraine needs to become more European internally and break from the corruption and oligarchic rule of its post-Soviet economy and society?
Ukraine remains a potentially rich country, and today it is closer to Europe – and vice versa – than at any time in its recent past.
Should Ukraine succeed in breaking its post-Soviet shackles, there will be no way around its EU membership.
Moreover, the West finally seems to understand what is at stake in Ukraine, namely the future of the European order and its framework for peace.
Whether the Euromaidan revolution succeeds will depend to a crucial extent on the Ukrainian people and their ability to free themselves from the structures and forces of the past, and on the West’s support, generosity, and resilience.
In Goethe’s Faust, Mephistopheles describes himself as “Part of that Power which still/Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.”
In the end, the same might apply to Putin.

Political Evolution
People everywhere want a new relationship with power – more autonomy and more respect.
This reflects our current era, in which new knowledge, ideas, and possibilities have made our identities richer, more fluid, and less subject to fate.
At the same time, the information society and globalization have made ours a more insecure world, where we experience risks that politics-as-usual has been unable to address.
As the leader of a political party, the central idea for me nowadays is to empower individuals.
A traditional party leader says to his followers, “You can trust me. ”
I think the future for progressive politics lies in leaders trusting citizens .
It’s a new kind of relationship.
We in PASOK, the party that I lead, have started to think through what we want out of politics in a practical sense and how this can be delivered in a way that respects people’s lives.
We’re making changes at the top in order to open up our party to greater participation.
We need to highlight, not hide , different views, and see our parties less as “war headquarters” and more as bio-diverse think tanks or workshops.
People can easily become lost in today’s ocean of information.
They will always be looking for a lighthouse, faros , as we say in Greek.
But what are these lighthouses?
In an information society they will be those who are trusted to be able to help interpret or analyse what is happening.
So I believe that the future for political parties is to develop a culture of debate, dialogue, and critical understanding of issues, where people can help set a nation’s priorities and are not simply told by experts or their leaders what is right and wrong for them.
Big issues, such as migration, narcotics, or the environment, no longer fall within a traditional left-right framework.
For example, people may see an inevitable tradeoff between tough environmental standards and jobs.
But these same people often want both.
It is no longer just one side against the other.
The nature of capitalist growth requires us to take a more holistic view and work out how we can achieve sustainable development.
Of course, bringing more democracy into our daily lives cannot mean perpetual debate, without actually making decisions.
Rather, it should mean that certain principles of respect, consultation, and deliberation become part of everyday life.
There is, by contrast, a traditional style of leadership that almost encourages fear and insecurity, so that a savior can come along and say, “I am the one who will solve this.”
President George W. Bush projects this style very openly.
I opposed the Bush administration’s policy on Iraq because this type of foreign policy is associated with a form of power – resurgent, I believe, in conservative parties around the world – that projects leadership as command.
I know this mindset well.
When I was first elected as a member of parliament in 1981, people said, “Now George, you’ve got to bang the table.”
People would say you look weak if you’re not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car wearing a tie.
Above all, to be “strong,” you’re supposed to be giving orders.
I said to myself, “I’m going to have to go about things in a more democratic way.”
I realized that I would have to fight to communicate what I wanted to achieve.
There was a whole political culture that had to change.
Part of my thinking concerns personal style, but also something deeper: the relationship between professional politicians and voters.
Obviously, there is a point where a leader must commit to a decision.
But one can do this in ways that are not violent and aggressive, by defending the principles of that new relationship.
Power by itself has no principles.
Our societies and citizens need more freedom if we are to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure world.
Consider the example of Greek-Turkish relations, which had hardened under the compressed weight of “establishment” views that were long entrenched in both countries.
Only a new approach could break the mold of conventional wisdom.
Quite often in confrontational situations, people and politicians create a zero-sum game culture, which results in authoritarian and militaristic leadership.
We in the former PASOK government instead helped create a more positive framework by declaring our commitment to work for consensus, thereby creating the basis for trust and mutual understanding.
Political parties everywhere must now become an agent for similar change.
Nowadays, the framework of power itself – the old-fashioned party hierarchy that takes command of the state or municipality – is a kind of abuse.
It takes power away from people in their own names, but gives them fear rather than confidence.
Not surprisingly, my party is now seeking to return to power in the next election.
But we’re also looking deeper and further ahead.
We will not be returned to government unless we offer a better kind of democracy in the long term.
In this enedeavor, we hope to set an example to the world.

Good Jobs for Disabled Workers
NAIROBI – Employment delivers more than a paycheck.
It also offers personal independence, social status, and the self-esteem that these assets bring.
For people with disabilities, these benefits are particularly valuable – and particularly difficult to access.
With the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the world has agreed to “promote full and productive employment and decent work for all” by 2030.
For a young country like Kenya, where 21% of the population is aged 19-24, progress is particularly urgent, in order to convert a youth bulge into a demographic dividend.
But, though the SDG agenda fails to acknowledge it, success will be impossible without addressing the unique – and formidable – challenges faced by disabled workers.
In developed countries, 50-70% of working-age people with disabilities are unemployed.
In the United Kingdom, a 2017 study indicates that disabled job seekers submit 60% more applications than their non-disabled counterparts before they secure a position.
Only 51% of applications from people with disabilities result in an interview, compared to 69% for non-disabled people.
In the developing world, the labor market is even tougher on people with disabilities, 80-90% of whom are unemployed.
In India, for example, only about 100,000 of some 70 million people with disabilities have obtained formal private-sector employment.
This is partly a result of discrimination by employers, who might assume that disabled workers are less productive or that non-disabled workers would find working with them annoying or disturbing.
Employers might also expect disabled workers to cost more.
This is certainly the case in Kenya, where companies are legally required to accommodate the needs of contracted employees with disabilities.
But barriers to employment arise long before disabled workers enter the labor market.
In Kenya, the UK-based Voluntary Services Overseas reports that people with disabilities often struggle to complete their education, owing to factors like inaccessible libraries and a lack of tutors trained to work with the disabled. There is only one teacher for every 105 children with emotional disabilities in Kenya, compared to one teacher for every 35 non-disabled students, meaning that the former probably receive significantly less personal attention and thus a lower quality of education.
Moreover, even disabled people who acquire technical proficiency that qualifies them for a position may not learn other key skills, such as how to communicate effectively.
Imagine that a 19-year-old Kenyan woman on the autism spectrum who suffers from a severe anxiety disorder is seeking employment.
Despite her impressive coding and typing skills, her inability to sell herself in a job interview severely undermines her chances of being hired.
Improving the employment prospects of people with disabilities thus requires not only the delivery of quality education tailored to their needs, but also the introduction of other targeted initiatives, such as job coaching. Job coaches would work directly with disabled people to gain a sense of their abilities, interests, and potential, while developing partnerships with employers, to whom they could recommend promising candidates.
This would allow disabled people to bypass an interview process in which they would struggle to perform well, while reassuring employers that a disabled candidate would not be an overly risky or costly choice.
Job coaches could also help to negotiate the terms of a new employee’s contract through so-called customized employment, which personalizes the employment relationship to ensure that it meets the needs of both employee and employer.
For example, that 19-year-old autistic woman might perform best working from home.
Because her duties are largely online, this would be entirely feasible, though the company might have to make reasonable accommodations, such as allowing her to take her laptop home and ensuring that she has Internet connectivity there.
Beyond boosting the employee’s own job satisfaction and productivity, such an agreement might save the company money, as it no longer has to accommodate her needs at the workplace.
Customized employment can also help to avoid friction between workers with disabilities and their colleagues.
Enabling people with disabilities to thrive in the labor market will require cooperation among multiple stakeholders, from private companies to schools to policymakers.
There are promising solutions available.
But if they are to take effect in time to achieve SDG8 – and, for Kenya, to harness its youth bulge – the time to start is now.

Darkness at Darfur
Darfur is shorthand for the latest example of a recurring international problem, one that gained headlines a decade ago in Rwanda.
What should the world do when a large number of people are the victims of violence originating from within their own country?
Darfur itself is a region of Western Sudan comprised of Arab and African Muslims. Conflict erupted in early 2003 when rebels of the Sudan Liberation Movement attacked government troops in an effort to gain greater autonomy and resources for their region.
Sudan government aircraft and government-supported troops (known as jangaweed) retaliated against not only armed rebels but also against civilians deemed to be supporting them.
Villages have been emptied, women raped, non-Arab men killed.
The origins of the current crisis may be in some dispute, but the costs are not.
More than 50,000 men, women and children have lost their lives; more than 1.5 million have been made homeless.
This is arguably genocide, a word used by the U.S. government but by few others to describe what is going on in Darfur.
Meanwhile, world leaders are debating what if anything should be done.
UN Security Council Resolution 1564, passed on 18 September 2004, reserves the bulk of its criticism for the government of Sudan. But the UN is not yet prepared to go beyond words.
The resolution threatens that the Security Council will consider imposing sanctions against Sudanese leaders or against the country’s important oil sector, but introduces no penalties at this time.
Why the hesitation?
More than anything else it stems from international reluctance to challenge any government over what it is doing within its own territory. This reflects a widely-held view of sovereignty, one that allows governments to do essentially what they want within their own borders.
Such thinking is inadequate and outmoded.
To begin with, there is a moral element. There is something wrong in looking the other way when one’s fellow human being is being slaughtered.
We all have some basic obligation to one another.
There are as well pragmatic considerations.
In a global world, what happens within one country can all too easily affect others.
For example, refugees leaving Sudan can strain the stability of neighboring Chad.
Opposition to genocide and other large-scale acts of violence against a population also reflects the established principle that citizens as well as governments have rights.
This principle is enshrined in various international documents, beginning with the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Governments ought not to be allowed to massacre their own people.
And weak governments should not be allowed to permit massacres to take place on their own territory even if they are not themselves carrying out the massacre.
What all this adds up to is a requirement for a concept of state sovereignty that is less than absolute.
To be precise, we need to embrace a contractual approach to sovereignty, one that recognizes the obligations and responsibilities as well as the rights of those who enjoy it.
Such an approach to sovereignty would essentially communicate to governments and their leaders that the rights and protections they associate with statehood are in fact conditional, and that governments and leaders would forfeit some or, in extreme cases, all of these rights and protections if they failed to meet their obligations.
This idea will only have an impact if the international community is prepared to go beyond voicing this principle and accept the necessary consequence: that other states and the world at large have a right and a duty to act to protect innocent life when it is jeopardized on a large scale.
Some movement in just this direction was suggested by widespread international support for the humanitarian interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. Another sign of change is the basic document (“Constitutive Act”) of the African Union, the regional organization launched in July 2000 to replace the ineffective Organization of African Unity.
After citing the principle of non-interference by one member state in the internal affairs of another, the document goes on to declare “the right of the Union to intervene in a member state pursuant to a decision of the assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.”
Intervention in such circumstances can take any number of forms, from public rhetoric and private diplomacy to economic and political sanctions to armed intervention.
All of which brings us back to Darfur.
What needs doing?
There is a need for massive assistance to the displaced people of Darfur.
Those who have survived conflict require help if they are not to succumb to disease and starvation.
There is also every reason to renew diplomatic efforts to bring about a lasting cease-fire and, following that, a settlement that addresses the grievances that helped bring about this crisis in the first place.
Two other points require highlighting, though.
First, and consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1564, countries should provide the African Union with the logistical, material, and financial help it has asked for.
With such support, AU-authorized troops could guard the refugee camps and, over time, protect villages so that men, women and children could return home in safety.
Second, the UN ought to make good on its threat and impose sanctions against the Sudanese government unless it stops using its aircraft to destroy villages and unless it stops supporting the jangaweed.
Criminal indictments for war crimes ought to be issued against specific officials who do not comply.
It is important that the world act, not simply to save the people of Darfur, but to prevent future Darfurs.
A great deal of innocent human life depends on it.

After the Taliban
``Failed state'' is a term applied frequently to Afghanistan and is often deemed the cause for why terrorists gained such influence there.
But a country does not fail of its own volition, nor is it weakened by unknown causes.
A country fails, when it fails, for definite, identifiable reasons.
These must be addressed if Afghanistan is to be revived.
Twenty years of invasion, civil war, and drought have left Afghanistan's institutions in ruin.
Millions of Afghans huddle in refugee camps or are displaced from their homes.
Land-mines defile the countryside.
Millions are sick and poor; many live at starvation levels.
For these and many other reasons, rebuilding Afghanistan's economy will require not only economic reconstruction but an effort to reinvent the country's political and cultural institutions.
Such a massive effort will be doomed to failure, however, if Afghanistan's neighbors intervene in ways that promote economic upheaval all over again.
Afghanistan is no place for quick fixes.
Rebuilding the country cannot be done cheaply.
Any thought that the anti-terror coalition will be able to bail out fast (as the West did when it abandoned Afghanistan to its fate after the Soviet withdrawal ten years ago) should be forgotten.
The West must stick with Afghanistan until its reconstruction is established. Otherwise, it runs the risk of renewed chaos and violence, but this time in a more destabilized region, as Pakistan's current problems demonstrate.
Three problems are of immediate concern, the most important being feeding the Afghan people - both within the country and in refugee camps outside Afghanistan.
Humanitarian aid is being delivered, but a distribution system safe from the predations of Afghanistan's warlords needs to be built.
Indeed, the warlords have been given too big a say in distributing aid already, and it may be hard to strip them of this power.
But stripped they must be.
The second problem involves relocating Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan and Iran, as well as those displaced within Afghanistan. To achieve this goal, the agricultural economy must be revived in order to revive this industry, providing jobs and food for people.
A massive impediment here is the millions of mines left over from the Soviet invasion that must be removed.
The West has a big incentive to be generous to Afghanistan's rural poor.
Starving farmers, if unassisted, may return to cultivating a very reliable cash crop: the opium poppy, long a staple of the warlord economy.
Eliminating it will not only help farmers and the West as it tries to curtail heroin use, but also Afghanistan's infant government as it struggles to assert its national authority against the warlords. A bankrupt warlord, after all, cannot buy weapons or bribe people to maintain their loyalty.
Major infrastructure investments will also be needed if the economy is to be revived.
Housing, particularly for returning refugees, will need to be constructed fast.
Cities such as Kabul, Mazar, Herat and others will need to be rebuilt as centers of economic and cultural life.
Village housing must be provided at a massive level.
Roads, airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored. The educational system needs to be rebuilt almost from scratch, and with so many women anxious to return to teaching, a revived educational system will also help Afghanistan's democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers.
Particular attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of cities.
Afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction, as it is not a society with a strong political center.
Planners should take advantage of the country's decentralized nature and emphasize private sector participation in reconstruction.
A decentralized system will respond better to local needs and avoid an over-bureaucratic public sector. But autonomous economic regions should be avoided as a threat to Afghan national unity because they would play into the hands of the warlords.
Moreover, poorer regions would do badly in such a system.
In the long run, Afghanistan has resources that can be exploited.
There is the potential for oil and gas exploration, and of mining iron ore and precious metals.
These activities should be explored in a framework of economic development across Central Asia.
Afghanistan, indeed, must be integrated into the regional pipeline and other development schemes.
Afghans can contribute in a tangible way here by reopening the North-South route connecting the resource rich economies of Central Asia to densely populated India and Pakistan.
None of this will be possible unless Afghanistan's young males are disarmed and given productive work.
Essential here, is to attract expatriate Afghans with skills and professional achievements to help in rebuilding the country by establishing small firms that will suck up the unemployed.
Expatriate involvement will also likely support the rights of women to participate fully and legally in economic and political life, as was the case before 1978.
Finally, donor countries must apply the lessons learned in restoring the war-ravaged states of the former Yugoslavia.
Grants and planning must be coordinated, and the consent of Afghanistan's neighboring countries assured. If the latter are ignored, regional interests can incite chaos once again.
An international conference on Afghanistan should be called by the US and held under UN auspices.
It must affirm not only Afghanistan's territorial integrity, but insure that donor commitments meet the scale of the job and that these promises are kept.
A decade ago, the West turned its back on Afghanistan and chaos ensued.
To abandon the country again would be criminal folly.

Prospects for US-China Relations in 2019
NEW YORK – Throughout 2018, much of Asia has been shaken by the new and increasingly unpredictable dynamics in Sino-American relations.
One year ago, US President Donald Trump returned from Beijing after his “state-plus” visit, which China hoped had finally laid his anti-Chinese campaign rhetoric to rest.
Twelve months later, China and the United States are caught in an unresolved trade war, and Trump’s administration has replaced US “strategic engagement” with China with “strategic competition.”
One year ago, moreover, the US, European, and Chinese economies and markets were roaring.
Now, there is deep instability in financial markets, with growth slowing in China and Europe, and higher interest rates beginning to bite in America.
Uncertainty over the future of the North Korean nuclear negotiations is also darkening the picture.
So what are the prospects for US-China relations in 2019?
It’s probable that by March there will be an agreement on reducing the bilateral trade deficit and the import decisions that China will make to see it through.
An agreement on tariff reductions by then is also possible, although its complexity may lengthen the timeline. A tariff-by-tariff approach could take a year.
But if Chinese economic reformers take a more dramatic approach, by committing to zero tariffs over time and challenging the Americans to reciprocate, it could be concluded more rapidly.
But this would run counter to decades of Chinese trade bureaucrats’ training to give away little, let alone be seen as giving away everything at once.
The reform of so-called forced technology transfer should be relatively straightforward.
Nonetheless, reform is different from how contractual arrangements may be interpreted in practice, even in the absence of any specific technology transfer provisions.
Intellectual property protection, however, is deeply problematic.
Previous agreements reached under President Barack Obama’s administration could be reconstituted. But the jurisdictional enforcement of breaches is still hopeless.
One possible mechanism is to subject relevant contracts between Chinese and foreign firms to international commercial arbitration bodies located in Singapore or Switzerland, designed to deal specifically with the enforcement of IP protection.
If China objected, it might be possible to develop China’s own domestically based international commercial arbitration system.
But the country would need to appoint qualified foreigners to its panel of arbitrators to build international credibility.
No one has any confidence in China’s commercial courts.
For its own domestic reform needs, China needs to move toward fully independent commercial and civil divisions of its court system, even if the criminal division remains subject to political control.
American concerns about Chinese state subsidies under the country’s Made in China 2025 strategy will be almost impossible to resolve.
The reality is that all countries use degrees of government support for their indigenous technology industries, although China uses the most.
Even if we mandated a maximum level of state support for a given firm, compliance would be difficult to measure.
I am not confident of a negotiated outcome in this area.
America may simply need to outcompete China by increasing public investment in research and development across the information technology and biotechnology sectors.
We should also not rule out the possibility of China pitching tariff reforms to the wider international community as well.
For example, China could make a dramatic commitment to zero tariffs over time not just to the US, but to all World Trade Organization member states.
This would represent an almost irresistible opportunity for China to champion global free trade and arrest the trend toward protectionism.
Such a turn by China could include approaching the Trans-Pacific Partnership’s member states for accession, in an ironic effort to outflank the US (which Trump withdrew from the TPP immediately upon taking office) in the Asia-Pacific region.
When it sees a political and market opening, China can be remarkably fleet of foot. Negotiations would be difficult, but Japan’s reservations about China’s TPP accession have softened since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s recent visit to Beijing.
On the wider foreign policy and security front, China in 2019 is likely to “de-conflict” itself in its relations with other countries, given the core strategic challenges posed by the US.
There is already some normalization in relations with Japan.
Recent Japanese Coastguard data indicate a drastic reduction in Chinese incursions into the Senkaku/Diaoyu area in the East China Sea.
China also wants to de-escalate tensions with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the South China Sea through the accelerated negotiation of a “code of conduct.” China is also likely to enjoy a calmer relationship with India, following the bilateral summit in Wuhan in April.
And China may begin to moderate its stance on Taiwan, given the poor results of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party in last month’s local government elections.
This would, of course, change radically if the US proceeds with further significant arms sales to Taiwan, as is likely.
Maritime incidents with the US in the South China Sea have continued, and the conflict may sharpen if the US pursues its Freedom of Navigation program more vigorously next year.
Across Eurasia, China will continue to roll out its Belt and Road Initiative. However, in recent months, the BRI has attracted less domestic political fanfare.
There is already debate among Chinese officials about revising certain BRI modalities, following negative reaction to Sri Lanka’s handover to China of the Hambantota Port, and concerns over the BRI’s long-term affordability.
We may therefore see less Chinese BRI triumphalism in 2019.
Moreover, China is likely to consolidate and expand its role within the existing United Nations and Bretton Woods institutions, rather than emphasizing new institutions of international governance. It will likely continue to be the WTO’s new champion, and to sustain its posture on global climate change as agreed under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
To the more sober minds in China’s foreign policy establishment, it is better to focus on the existing machinery of the global rules-based system, particularly when the US is demonstrating systematic contempt for it.
As China seeks to re-stabilize its relationship with the US, and ease tensions in its non-US relationships, its leaders are likely to use 2019 to form a deeper judgment about the future of US politics: the impact of the Mueller investigation on Trump and his administration, and whether a new president in 2020 (or sooner) would in any way change the emerging new US strategy.
While they have already concluded that a deep shift in American attitudes to China has occurred, they remain uncertain about what precise form that shift is taking, and whether a fundamental shift in their strategy (as opposed to tactics) is warranted.

The IMF Is Not the Problem
Brazil's current presidential election campaign has again brought the IMF to the center of international debate.
Are IMF cures worse than the disease, as critics such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz allege?
Kenneth Rogoff, the IMF's chief economist, speaks for the defense.
Throughout much of the world, the IMF is caricatured as a demon of austerity.
Wherever the IMF appears on the scene to provide financial assistance, painful government budget cuts seem certain to follow.
This image of austerity appeals to the emotional need for stories with villains.
After all, good villains sell books--including books about globalization that demonize the IMF.
But does the image reflect reality?
Is the IMF, the member of the UN family charged to maintain global financial stability, really so evil or misguided that it can only propose policies that inflict economic pain instead of alleviating it?
I admit that the IMF has its faults, and I don't aim to gloss over them.
Until a year ago, when I left a professorship at Harvard University to become the Fund's chief economist, I was a vocal, if perhaps not vitriolic, critic of the IMF's management of the international monetary system.
Although the IMF has changed a lot in recent years, there is no denying that there are still major holes in the international system--not least the lack of a fair and orderly procedure for dealing with highly indebted countries that become insolvent.
The IMF is working to fill that gap now.
But the austerity charge is misconceived.
Troubled countries knock on the Fund's door for financial assistance only when all other creditors have turned their backs.
In most cases, a country is already in desperate fiscal straits by the time IMF economists arrive on the scene to discuss a loan.
More often than not, the country has over-extended itself financially through some combination of imprudence and bad luck.
Countries come to the IMF precisely because they know that it will lend to them when no one else will, and at interest rates lower than most could only dream of, even in the best of times.
IMF loans thus relieve austerity: they help governments limit the amount of budgetary belt-tightening required in a crisis.
You think I am crazy?
Allow me to draw an analogy from my personal finances.
Just after I finished school, my older brother Hal ran into some financial difficulties.
He and his wife had started ripping out all the walls, plumbing, and wiring in their modest Washington apartment, hoping to refurbish it prior to the arrival of their first child.
It was an ambitious plan, but it seemed doable--until Hal started having problems with his baking business.
Suddenly they found themselves desperately over-extended.
Hal went to the bank for a loan, but with his business struggling, he didn't qualify.
With all his credit cards at their limit, and all his cash gone, Hal finally came to me for a loan. I had managed to put aside some modest savings, which I freely lent him indefinitely at zero interest.
Even with my help, things weren't easy.
Hal had to work longer hours than ever before, and he still had to sharply cut back on household expenditures across the board.
But my loan did help, eventually Hal's business recovered, my nephew was born and--much later--the apartment remodeling project came to a successful conclusion.
Now, did my brother blame me for the period of belt-tightening austerity his family had to face?
No, obviously not.
Admittedly, this is a simplistic analogy, but it captures the essence of the issue.
Yes, I did not ask Hal what, exactly, he planned to do with my money (would he use it to fix his plumbing, to help his business, or would he waste it somehow?). When the IMF comes in, it typically applies some degree of conditionality, as would any other lender, to ensure that its loan is eventually repaid, and used for its intended purpose.
Unlike my loan to Hal, the IMF usually does ask government officials to show how they plan to put their country back on its feet.
Indeed, it is this planning dialogue that does more than anything else to help stabilize the economy and restore a viable balance of payments.
It is not always an easy process, and reasonable people can and do disagree about the design of IMF-supported programs both before and after the fact.
The IMF really does need to listen to its critics and constantly to seek better ways to accomplish its aims. But it is patently absurd to charge that misguided IMF policy advice is the main reason why debt-crisis countries face austerity.
When a country finally suffers through austerity and repays its IMF loans, no rich private shareholder gets fat as a result.
The IMF's shareholders are its 184 member countries, and the Fund does not really pay dividends, other than in an accounting sense.
As soon as one country repays its loans, the IMF is better placed to re-lend the foreign exchange to the next country in crisis. However effective the IMF's crisis prevention efforts are, realistically there will always be a next crisis country.
Yes, the IMF needs many changes, as does the broader international financial system within which it operates.
But saying that it causes austerity is like saying that doctors cause plagues.

Controlling Cyber Conflict
LAS VEGAS – When cyber-security professionals were polled recently at their annual BlackHat conference in Las Vegas, 60% said they expected the United States to suffer a successful attack against its critical infrastructure in the next two years.
And US politics remains convulsed by the aftermath of Russian cyber interference in the 2016 election.
Are cyber-attacks the wave of the future, or can norms be developed to control international cyber conflict?
We can learn from the history of the nuclear age.
While cyber and nuclear technologies are vastly different, the process by which society learns to cope with a highly disruptive technology shows instructive similarities.
It took states about two decades to reach the first cooperative agreements in the nuclear era.
If one dates the cyber-security problem not from the beginning of the Internet in the 1970s, but from the late 1990s, when burgeoning participation made the Internet the substrate for economic and military interdependence (and thus increased our vulnerability), cooperation is now at about the two-decade mark.
The first efforts in the nuclear era were unsuccessful United Nations-centered treaties.
In 1946, the US proposed the Baruch plan for UN control of nuclear energy, and the Soviet Union promptly rejected locking itself into a position of technological inferiority.
It was not until after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 that a first arms control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, was signed, in 1963.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty followed in 1968, and the bilateral US-USSR Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1972.
In the cyber field, Russia proposed a UN treaty to ban electronic and information weapons (including propaganda) in 1999.
With China and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, it has continued to push for a broad UN-based treaty.
The US resisted what it saw as an effort to limit American capabilities, and continues to regard a broad treaty as unverifiable and deceptive.
Instead, the US, Russia, and 13 other states agreed that the UN Secretary General should appoint a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), which first met in 2004.
That group initially produced meager results; but, by July 2015, it issued a report, endorsed by the G20, that proposed norms for limiting conflict and confidence-building measures.
Groups of experts are not uncommon in the UN process, but only rarely does their work rise from the UN’s basement to a summit of the world’s 20 most powerful states.
But while the GGE’s success was extraordinary, last month it failed and was unable to issue a consensus report for 2017.
The GGE process has limitations.
The participants are technically advisers to the UN Secretary General rather than fully empowered national negotiators.
Over the years, as the number of GGE member states increased from the original 15 to 20 and then to 25, the group became more unwieldy, and political issues became more intrusive.
According to one diplomat who has been central to the process, some 70 countries have expressed interest in participating.
But as the numbers expand, the difficulty of reaching agreement increases.
There is a wide range of views about the future of the GGE process.
A first draft of a new report existed at the beginning of this year, and the able German chairman argued that the group should not rewrite the 2015 report, but try to say more about the steps that states should take in peacetime.
Some states suggested new norms to address data integrity and maintenance of the Internet’s core structures.
There was general agreement about confidence-building measures and the need to strengthen capacity.
The US and like-minded states pressed for further clarification of the earlier agreement that international laws of armed conflict, including the right of self-defense, apply in cyber space, but China, Russia, and their allies were reluctant to agree.
And the deterioration in US-Russian relations soured the political climate.
Moreover, whereas some states hope to revive the GGE process or enlarge it into a broader UN process, others are skeptical, and believe that future progress will be limited to discussions among like-minded states, rather than leading to universal agreements.
Norms that may be ripe for discussion outside the GGE process could include protected status for the core functions of the Internet; supply-chain standards and liability for the Internet of Things; treatment of election processes as protected infrastructure; and, more broadly, norms for issues such as crime and information warfare.
All of these are among the topics that may be considered by the new informal Global Commission on Stability in Cyberspace established early this year and chaired by former Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand.
Progress on the next steps of norm formation will require simultaneous use of many different formats, both private and governmental.
For example, the 2015 agreement between China and the US to limit industrial cyber espionage was a bilateral accord that was later taken up by the G20.
In some cases, the development of norms among like-minded states can attract adherence by others at a later point.
In others, such as the Internet of Things, norms for security standards may benefit from leadership by the private sector or non-profit stakeholders in establishing codes of conduct. And progress in some areas need not wait for others.
A regime of norms may be more robust when linkages are not too tight, and an over-arching UN treaty would harm such flexibility at this point.
Expansion of participation is important for the acceptance of norms, but progress will require action on many fronts.
Given this, the failure of the GGE in July 2017 should not be viewed as the end of the process.

The Defeated Remain Defiant
HARARE: Before Zimbabwe's Presidential election earlier this month, I believed that if the election were not handled properly, there would be serious fallout in the country and throughout Southern Africa. Despite the shadows of war and terrorism, I called for a fair and free election.
In the two years that led up to the Presidential vote, the people of Zimbabwe were subjected to severe intimidation, harassment and fear, all of which was carried out as part of a broader program of state-sponsored terrorism by Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). ZANU terrorism was conducted by rogue elements among the veterans of Zimbabwe's war of independence two decades ago, as well as by government militiamen and youths, all of whom were actively aided by the police.
This intimidation and violence meant that my party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) could not reach the electorate in large parts of the countryside. In addition, the government of President Mugabe, my opponent, effectively disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of urban voters, particularly in the capital city of Harare and in the city of Chitungwiza.
Because of an inadequate number of polling stations, I believe that in Harare and Chitungwiza alone more than 360,000 people stood in a queue to vote but never gained the opportunity to cast their ballot.
My concerns about the legitimacy of the election results are further raised by interference by Mugabe's militia, whose members prevented the MDC from placing polling agents in 52% of rural polling stations.
By the end of the voting, our party had no observers at 6 out of 10 rural stations.
This effectively meant that Mugabe's supporters could have their way at these stations.
We are compiling a comprehensive list of the polling stations where ZANU supporters had solitary control.
In our investigations so far, a pattern has emerged even at this early stage: these polling stations recorded the highest number of voters for Mugabe.
In light of all the evidence, I cannot accept the Presidential election results in which Robert Mugabe, the sitting president, was declared a winner this month with 56% of the 3 million votes tallied.
The official results do not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and are illegitimate in the eyes of the people.
Zimbabwe's people have been cheated of their right to freely and democratically elect a President of their choice.
The contest over the election results is a political issue that must be resolved politically.
Food and fuel are in short supply, jobs are vanishing, inflation is running at more than 100%.
The people of Zimbabwe deserve a celebration for their courage and determination.
We may yet get one.
As I write, I am saddened because Mugabe's regime remains intent on defying the people's will.
Whatever may happen, I as the people's loyal servant am with them all the way.
The government may want to arrest me.
Indeed, I was arrested for treason even before the election.
At worst, they may even wish to kill me.
But the government will never destroy the spirit of the people to reclaim their rights and power.
The power to achieve democratic change is in our hands.
We may have moments of fear in the days ahead, but we must never let despair overwhelm us.
The tide of political change is irreversible.
But we must be prepared to pay a high price for our freedom.
President Mugabe and his cronies are afraid of the people and we have heard they may do anything to kill the messenger.
If they do, I only ask that the people of Zimbabwe remain strong and carry on the work that we began together.
Among ordinary Zimbabweans walk heroes - heroes who waited hours and hours to vote, heroes who refused to be turned away.
These are the heroes of the new Zimbabwe whose voices must be heard around the world.
Together, we traveled a very harsh road together to achieve democratic change in my country.
Rarely in the history of humankind have a people faced such brutality while retaining such gracious exuberance.
I realize that the people of Zimbabwe are impatient.
I understand why.
But they must wait peacefully for the political process to unfold.
They will not let this election stand but neither will they succumb to Mugabe's provocative traps and resort to violence.
The people of Zimbabwe want constitutional change, legal change, legitimate change, and they are going to obtain it in spite of all the obstacles.
In this, we know we are not alone.
We know that throughout Africa, the will of the electorate has been thwarted.
It appears in the majority of African states, whenever you have elections, you have irregularities, fraud, cheating.
There's always a crisis of elections in Africa.
There is, sad to say, a lack of sincerity on the part of governments across this continent when it comes time to give people the right to choose.
But those who wish otherwise can take hope.
Zimbabwe's struggle is not over.
We have time to tally the lessons for Africa, and the world, of our experience.
My people are in their hour of greatest need.
I pledge not to abandon them.

Harnessing Malawi’s Youth Bulge
LILONGWE – Malawi is facing a massive youth bulge, with more than half the population under the age of 18 – a share that is growing fast.
This can be a boon for development, as a dynamic young working-age population propels the economy into the future.
But, if the country fails to provide adequate educational and employment opportunities to its youth population, such a demographic structure can become highly destabilizing.
For Malawi, the risk of the latter outcome is high.
A landlocked country bordered by Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia, Malawi has ranked among the world’s poorest countries since it gained independence from the British in 1964.
In 2016, a staggering 70.3% of the population was living below the World Bank’s poverty line of less than $1.90 per day (in purchasing-power-parity terms).
Last year, the country ranked 172nd out of 189 countries and territories in the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Report.
Against this background, Malawi’s booming population – which is set to double, from 17.5 million in 2018, by 2038 – poses considerable challenges, as it strains the country’s limited resources, from investment capital to food.
The result could easily be widespread unemployment, malnutrition, and conceivably large-scale migration. Climate change will only exacerbate these resource pressures, making mitigation policies all but impossible to implement.
The first step toward ensuring that the Malawi demographic boom does not stunt its development potential is to curb the fertility rate through better family planning.
This means both delivering contraceptives and educating the population on how to use them.
More broadly, education – especially of girls and women – is closely correlated with declining fertility rates.
But Malawi can do more than limit its youth bulge; it can harness its demographic dividend to spur economic development.
What the country’s young people lack is not talent or ambition, but the training, resources, and opportunities needed to apply them.
For many young Malawians, the best hope of escaping poverty is migrating to much more economically dynamic South Africa.
To build a thriving economy that makes the most of local talent, Malawi can draw inspiration from Rwanda.
Until the summer of 1994, Rwanda was locked in a vicious civil war, in which more than a million people were brutally murdered.
And yet, from 2011 to 2014, Rwanda’s annual GDP growth averaged about 8%, propelled by investment in construction, agricultural modernization, mining, and manufacturing.
More recently, Rwanda has focused on building up its information and communications technology (ICT) sector, which can provide solutions in a range of areas, including health, transport, environment, and energy.
Malawi should take a similar approach, employing prudent economic planning and management and sustained investment in human capital to spur growth and development. It can even channel resources toward the same sectors as Rwanda does, in order to diversify an economy that now depends largely on traditional rain-fed agriculture, with tobacco as the main cash crop.
Young people can spearhead this transformation.
But ICT, in particular, demands improved education and training, not only in school, but also once workers are already in the labor force.
Furthermore, targeted employment and health policies should be introduced, to ensure that young people share in the dividends of private-sector success. And the government should aim to nurture talent in the arts, including fashion, and sports, thereby providing young people with another potential path out of poverty.
There are reasons for optimism.
Since 2017, Malawi’s government has been working with UNICEF to expand the use of drones and data for development and humanitarian purposes, from delivering medical resources to collecting aerial imagery for predictive analytics.
In order to ensure that there are enough skilled workers to seize the opportunities offered by drone and data technology, UNICEF established the first African Drone and Data Academy this past January in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe.
Moreover, Malawi has built a robust democracy since independence.
When last year’s presidential election, which delivered a narrow victory to the incumbent, Peter Mutharika, was shown to have been marred by “widespread” irregularities, the constitutional court overturned the result and ordered a new vote.
Many other African countries could learn much from Malawi’s democratic process, in which young people play a crucial role by campaigning, voting, and, when necessary, protesting.
Their government must now respond with the necessary steps to ensure that their economic prospects are as promising as their abilities.

China’s Summer of Discontent
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Politics has a nasty habit of surprising us – especially in a country like China, where there is little transparency and a lot of intrigue.
Five months ago, President Xi Jinping jolted his countrymen by abolishing the presidential term limit and signaling his intention to serve for life.
But the real surprise was to come later.
At the time of Xi’s announcement, the conventional wisdom was that his dominance inside the Chinese party-state was virtually absolute, and thus that his authority could not possibly come under attack.
Xi is now facing the worst summer since he came to power in November 2012, characterized by a steady stream of bad news that has left many Chinese – and especially Chinese elites – feeling disappointed, anxious, angry, helpless, and dissatisfied with their increasingly powerful leader.
The latest piece of bad news, which broke late last month, was the discovery by government investigators that a pharmaceutical company had been producing substandard vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough, and had faked data for its rabies vaccine.
Hundreds of thousands of Chinese children nationwide have been given the faulty vaccines.
Of course, China has experienced many similar scandals before – from tainted baby formula to the contamination of the blood-thinning drug heparin – with greedy businessmen and corrupt officials held to account. But Xi has staked considerable political capital on rooting out corruption and strengthening control.
The fact that a private company with deep political connections is at the center of the vaccine scandal is painful evidence that Xi’s top-down anti-corruption drive has not been as effective as claimed.
An unintended consequence of Xi’s consolidation of power is that he is accountable for the scandal, at least in the eyes of the Chinese public.
But the backlash against Xi began even before the vaccine revelations.
Concerns were rising over the gradual creation of a personality cult.
In recent months, Xi’s loyalists have spared no effort in this regard.
The desolate village where Xi spent seven years as a farmer during the Cultural Revolution has been branded as a source of “great knowledge” and become a red-hot tourist destination.
For some, this is all too reminiscent of the quasi-divine status attributed to Mao Zedong which, during the “Great Leap Forward” and “Cultural Revolution” resulted in millions of deaths and nearly destroyed the Chinese economy.
And, in fact, today’s economic news in China is grim, beginning with a 14% decline in stock prices this year.
Three summers ago, in the face of sharply falling stock prices, Xi ordered state-owned companies to buy shares to prop up the market.
But as soon as the forced purchases stopped, another market decline followed, this time against a background of depleted foreign-exchange reserves.
Xi has not repeated that bit of economic illiteracy this time around, but what will come next for China’s stock market remains an open question.
And there is more bad economic news.
The renminbi has reached a 13-month low, and while GDP growth is ostensibly on track to meet the 6.5% target for 2018, the economy is showing signs of weakness.
Investment, real-estate sales, and private consumption are all slowing, prompting the government to halt its deleveraging effort and allocate more funds to propping up growth.
The worst economic development, however, is the unfolding trade war with the United States.
Though its economic impact has yet to be felt, the clash over trade that US President Donald Trump has initiated is likely to be the toughest challenge Xi has faced so far, for reasons that extend far beyond the economy.
For starters, there is Xi’s promotion of the “China Dream,” which entails the country’s revival as a world power.
But, as the trade war makes starkly apparent, China remains deeply dependent on US markets and technology.
Far from a rejuvenated hegemon poised to reshape the global economy, Xi’s China has been exposed as a giant with feet of clay.
The geostrategic implications are difficult to exaggerate.
In the 40 years since Deng Xiaoping began to lead China out of the Maoist dark ages, the country has achieved unprecedented economic growth and development.
But that progress would have been impossible – or, at least, much slower – were it not for China’s policy of maintaining a cooperative relationship with the US.
Xi has upended that policy during his tenure, not least with his increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea.
These developments point to a straightforward conclusion: China is headed in the wrong direction.
This is not lost on China’s elites, whose frustration is palpable – and rising.
Yet, despite rumors of pushback against his power by retired elderly leaders, Xi is unlikely to be overthrown. He remains solidly in control of the Chinese party-state’s security apparatus and the military.
Moreover, he has no rivals with the courage or influence genuinely to challenge his authority, as Deng and other veteran revolutionaries did in 1978, when they pushed out Hua Guofeng, Mao’s hand-picked successor as leader of the Communist Party of China.
Nonetheless, the road ahead for Xi remains treacherous.
If he stays his current course, so will China, with each stumble reinforcing negative perceptions of his leadership.
Yet changing course could also hurt Xi’s reputation, as it would amount to an admission of flawed judgment – a problem for any leader, but especially for a strongman like Xi.
And some of the new policies Xi would have to adopt conflict with his instincts and values.
The risks are real.
But Xi probably doesn’t have much choice but to face them.
As China’s summer of discontent clearly suggests, he needs a new game plan.

The Vise Tightens on the Dollar
NEW HAVEN – The US dollar has now entered the early stages of what looks to be a sharp descent.
The dollar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) fell 4.3% in the four months ending in August.
The decline has been even steeper as measured by other indexes, but the REER is what matters most for trade, competitiveness, inflation, and monetary policy.
To be sure, the recent pullback only partly reverses the nearly 7% surge from February to April.
During that period, the dollar benefited from the flight to safety triggered by the “sudden stop” in the global economy and world financial markets arising from the COVID-19 lockdown.
Even with the recent modest correction, the greenback remains the most overvalued major currency in the world, with the REER still 34% above its July 2011 low.
I continue to expect this broad dollar index to plunge by as much as 35% by the end of 2021.
This reflects three considerations: rapid deterioration in US macroeconomic imbalances, the ascendancy of the euro and the renminbi as viable alternatives, and the end of that special aura of American exceptionalism that has given the dollar Teflon-like resilience for most of the post-World War II era.
The first factor – America’s mounting imbalances – is now playing out in real time with a vengeance.
The confluence of an unprecedented erosion of domestic saving and the current-account deficit – joined at the hip through arithmetic accounting identities – is nothing short of staggering.
The net national saving rate, which measures the combined depreciation-adjusted saving of businesses, households, and the government sector, plunged into negative territory at -1% in the second quarter of 2020.
That had not happened since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, when net national saving fell into negative territory for nine consecutive quarters, averaging -1.7% from the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2010.
But the most important aspect of this development was the speed of the collapse.
At -1% in the second quarter, the net saving rate fell fully 3.9 percentage points from the pre-COVID 2.9% reading in the first quarter.
This is, by far, the sharpest one-quarter plunge in domestic saving on record, dating back to 1947.
What has triggered this unprecedented collapse in net domestic saving is no secret.
COVID-19 sparked a temporary surge in personal saving that has been more than outweighed by a record expansion in the federal budget deficit.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act featured $1,200 relief checks to most Americans, as well as a sharp expansion of unemployment insurance benefits, both of which boosted the personal saving rate to an unheard of 33.7% in April.
Absent these one-off injections, the personal saving rate quickly receded to a still-lofty 17.8% in July and is set to fall even more sharply with the recent expiration of expanded unemployment benefits.
Offsetting this was a $4.5 trillion annualized widening of the federal deficit in the second quarter of 2020 (on a net saving basis), to $5.7 trillion, which swamped the $3.1 trillion surge in net personal saving in the same period.
With personal saving likely to recede sharply in the months ahead and the federal budget deficit exploding toward 16% of GDP in the current fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the plunge in net domestic saving in the second quarter of 2020 is only a hint of what lies ahead.
This will trigger a collapse in the US current-account deficit.
Lacking in saving and wanting to invest and grow, the US must import surplus saving from abroad and run massive external deficits to attract foreign capital.
Again, this is not esoteric economic theory – just a simple balance-of-payments accounting identity.
The validity of this linkage was, in fact, confirmed by the recent release of US international transactions statistics for the second quarter of 2020.
Reflecting the plunge in domestic saving, the current-account deficit widened to 3.5% of GDP – the worst since the 4.3% deficit in the fourth quarter of 2008 during the global financial crisis.
Like the saving collapse, the current-account dynamic is unfolding in an equally ferocious fashion.
Relative to the 2.1%-of-GDP current-account deficit in the first period of 2020, the 1.4-percentage-point widening in the second quarter was the largest quarterly deterioration on record (dating back to 1960).
With the net domestic saving rate likely headed into record depths of between -5% and -10% of national income, I fully expect the current-account deficit to break its previous record of 6.3% of GDP, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Driven by the explosive surge in the federal budget deficit this year and next, the collapse of domestic saving and the current-account implosion should unfold at near-lightning speed.
It is not just rapidly destabilizing saving and current-account imbalances that are putting downward pressure on the dollar.
A shift in the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy is a new and important ingredient in the mix.
By moving to an approach that now targets average inflation, the Fed is sending an important message: zero-interest rates are likely to persist for longer than previously thought, regardless of any temporary overshoots of the 2% price stability target.
This new bias toward monetary accommodation effectively closes off an important option – upward adjustments to interest rates – that has long tempered currency declines in most economies.
By default, that puts even more pressure on the falling dollar as the escape valve from America’s rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic imbalances.
In short, the vise is tightening on a still-overvalued dollar.
Domestic saving is now plunging as never before, and the current-account balance is following suit.
Don’t expect the Fed, focused more on supporting equity and bond markets than on leaning against inflation, to save the day.
The dollar’s decline has only just begun.

Confronting the Global Water Crisis
CAMBRIDGE – Around the world, demand for fresh water doubles every 20 years, owing to increasing population and affluence. Yet pollution, climate change, and seawater intrusion are diminishing supplies of fresh water at similar rates.
So, is a global fresh water crisis looming?
Fortunately, the situation appears to be less alarming.
This is not to deny that the supply of fresh water is getting tight.
Left unattended, major disruptions for human society could occur.
Many argue that water is different from resources such as oil, because there are often no substitutes for water in most uses (particularly growing food).
Moreover, water is an essentially fixed resource, albeit one that renews itself every year.
There are prodigious quantities of water on the globe, but most of it is salty ocean water and brackish groundwater.
There are huge resources of fresh water, but most is in ice sheets and glaciers, with only a small percentage readily available where and when we need it.
The supply of water is also highly variable across regions and within countries, with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times.
One new factor influencing water supplies is rising global temperature.
Although we are not certain about the exact effects, many scientists believe that total annual precipitation will increase, but that its seasonality and the frequency of extremes may also increase.
This would make it difficult to use the existing supply infrastructure of dams, reservoirs, treatment systems, and pipelines without big modifications.
From the writings of the earliest modern commentators on the drivers of socio-economic growth and decline – Adam Smith, Edward Gibbon, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx – we see that concern about exhausting resources is not new.
Malthus and Ricardo were particularly prescient about the roles of population, food, and energy resources.
Malthus postulated a geometric rate of population growth (like compound interest on a bank deposit) and an arithmetic rate of growth (simple interest on a bank account) of food production.
These curves always intersect after a couple of decades, and Malthus predicted widespread famine or violent conflicts: food and population would be aligned with each other by “misery, war, pestilence, and vice.”
Ricardo projected “declining returns” on investments in resources, whereby the best (least-cost) resources are used first, followed by the next best, and so on.
Increasing demand for resources leads to price increases that will continue until the resource becomes too expensive to use.
Of course, these constraints were at work over previous centuries, before Malthus and Ricardo articulated them, but homo sapiens was able to “cheat” by expanding our resource base (colonialism) to bring in cheaper resources and food; by finding substitutes for scarce resources; and by improving our technology so that the same amounts of land and resources could be used more efficiently.
Because the world is now pretty much filled up, there are few opportunities to expand the physical supply of resources.
The real question now facing the planet is whether we can continue improving our technologies or finding cheaper substitutes. Just because something worked over the past 200 years does not mean that it will necessarily continue to work.
This is the crux of the problem facing global water resources.
But we can avoid a crisis by embracing the following technical and managerial adaptations:
- Trade virtual water – the amount of water that is embodied in producing a product (usually food) and shipping it somewhere else to be used.
This saves the recipient from using his own water, which can be saved for higher-value activities;
- Conserve irrigation water.
Because agriculture routinely accounts for 75-90% of all water consumed in a country, a 10% efficiency gain would save as much water as all the water used by the country’s municipalities and industry.
Another way of improving irrigation efficiency is by developing crops that produce more food with the same, or less, water. Research on such genetically modified (GM) foods is well advanced in several of the largest water-scarce countries, such as China and India;
- Exploit advanced desalination.
Modern developments in desalination have brought the cost per unit of desalinated seawater to levels comparable to obtaining fresh water from natural sources (approximately US$0.05 per cubic meter).
- Expand wastewater recycling.
Urban areas typically dispose of about 85% of their fresh-water intake as wastewater, often in neighboring water bodies.
The wastes could be treated and used to replenish groundwater.
Emerging low-water-using sanitation technologies such as urine-separating dry-composting toilets could also significantly reduce urban water demands if properly developed;
- Develop creative pricing policies for urban water and wastewater. Protecting human and ecosystem health are difficult to price, because they form part of the pervasive externalities associated with water use.
Nevertheless, many water uses would respond well to more efficient prices.
Although avoiding a global water crisis will not be easy, we have at hand policies and technologies that, if properly applied, could see us safely through the next several decades, even in the face of increasing – and increasingly wealthy – populations.

Seven Fallacies of Economic Sanctions
LONDON – The sanctions imposed on Iran by US President Donald Trump have begun to bite the country’s economy hard.
Inflation, seemingly defeated by President Hassan Rouhani, has returned with a vengeance, hitting 31% in 2018.
According to the International Monetary Fund, the economy is poised to shrink by 6% this year, and inflation could reach 37%.
Many industries are experiencing severe difficulties, and unemployment is mounting.
Aiming to cut Iranian oil exports to zero, Trump is threatening to sanction countries – like China, India, and Japan – that continue to buy Iranian oil.
Given the pain that Trump’s unilateral sanctions are causing Iran, are they really the “silver bullet” policy that his administration hopes they will be?
Since World War I, governments have increasingly used economic sanctions to achieve their international political objectives.
Despite a century of experience, however, the rationale for such measures remains far from compelling.
Economic sanctions have become even more popular in recent decades.
In the 1990s, for example, sanctions regimes were introduced at an average rate of about seven per year.
Of the 67 cases in that decade, two-thirds were unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States.
During Bill Clinton’s presidency, it is estimated that around 40% of the world’s population, or 2.3 billion people, were subject to some form of US sanctions.
In fact, the great majority of sanctions are imposed by large countries against small countries.
Currently, the US has nearly 8,000 sanctions in place worldwide, with Iran by far the largest state target.
In addition, since the 1960s, the United Nations Security Council has established 30 multilateral sanctions regimes under Article 41 of the UN Charter.
The most successful of these arguably played a key role in ending the apartheid regimes in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia (today’s Zimbabwe).
In addition to targeting specific countries, the UN has also imposed sanctions on non-state entities such as al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and, more recently, the so-called Islamic State (ISIS).
But it remains highly doubtful that Iran will change its policies, let alone its regime, in the face of Trump’s sanctions.
The simple truth about economic sanctions is that, though widely used, they often fail.
A comprehensive study of 170 twentieth-century cases in which sanctions were imposed concluded that only one-third of them attained their stated objectives.
Another study estimates the success rate of sanctions regimes to be lower than 5%.
Such a high failure rate suggests that governments often use flawed arguments to justify imposing sanctions, tainting our understanding of their rationale and effectiveness.
Seven misconceptions or fallacies stand out.
Each needs to be debunked.
First, sanctions are justified as a gentler and more humane alternative to war.
But this underestimates the potential for international diplomacy to resolve conflicts.
And in reality, sanctions often pave the way for wars rather than averting them: 13 years of international sanctions against Iraq were followed by the 2003 US-led invasion, for example.
A second argument is that “if sanctions are hurting, they must be working.” But this criterion of effectiveness fails to define what would constitute success.
Worse, it flies in the face of evidence suggesting that – even when essentials such as food and medicine are excluded – sanctions hurt large swaths of the civilian population.
They stymie economic growth, undermine production, and cause businesses to fail, resulting in higher unemployment.
Sanctions can also fuel inflation by restricting imports and fueling currency crises.
Third, sanctions are often said to be “smart” and “targeted.”
In practice, however, comprehensive economic sanctions are collective punishment.
They squeeze the middle classes and impose a disproportionate burden on the poorest and most vulnerable, who are arguably the biggest victims of the very regimes that sanctions are designed to punish.
Fourth, some governments justify sanctions as a way to uphold and promote human rights.
But evidence suggests that civil-society entities and NGOs are generally among the biggest losers under sanctions.
By portraying sanctions as foreign aggression and economic warfare against their country, authoritarian regimes often accuse human-rights activists of being allied with the enemy.
From there, it’s a short step to a national-security crackdown on such organizations.
Iran is following that pattern.
Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last May, coupled with the imposition of a new round of sanctions, has emboldened Iran’s hardliners, who now claim that their distrust of the US was justified and are pushing back against Rouhani’s centrist administration.
Similarly, sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the 1990s led to the wholesale destruction of civil society there, helping to stoke the identity politics and sectarianism that continue to bedevil that country and the wider region.
A fifth claim is that sanctions are necessary and effective in bringing about regime change.
The cases of South Africa and Zimbabwe notwithstanding, this is probably the weakest of the seven arguments – as the longevity of sanctioned regimes in countries such as North Korea, Cuba, and Myanmar indicate.
Even the blockade imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt since June 2017 has boosted the emir’s popularity and led a significant part of the population to rally behind him.
Sixth, sanctions are said to weaken the targeted governments.
But by worsening the business and investment climate, economic sanctions take their toll primarily on the private sector.
If anything, power becomes more centralized and concentrated as governments increasingly control supplies of strategic commodities given the shortages they cause.
Finally, sanctions are supposedly effective in containing nuclear proliferation.
Here, too, their record is demonstrably poor.
Since the Non-Proliferation Treaty entered into force in 1970, four countries have acquired nuclear weapons: Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea.
Three of them did so while under sanctions.
Ultimately, the success or failure of economic sanctions is judged by whether they bring about regime change or change a government’s behavior.
Given the prevailing misconceptions about their rationale, it is not surprising – as we are likely to see again in Iran – that they so often achieve neither goal.
What is more certain is that destabilizing Iran will make the region more dangerous than ever.

Why is the US Presidential Race So Close?
WASHINGTON, DC – Many people around the world are probably wondering why Hillary Clinton – who is obviously more prepared and better suited for the American presidency than her opponent, Donald Trump – isn’t waltzing to victory.
Many Americans share the world’s bewilderment.
National opinion polls may well continue to fluctuate until the election on November 8.
But Trump has been closing in on Clinton in recent weeks, even threatening to catch up with her in the Electoral College vote, where the Democrats’ control of some of the most populous states (New York and California) give Clinton an advantage.
Why is this happening?
For starters, Trump, despite knowing almost nothing about governance or public policy, has managed to consolidate most Republicans behind him.
One motivation is Republicans’ long-held hatred of Clinton.
Another is the Supreme Court; the court already has one vacant seat for the next president to fill and is likely to have more over the next four years.
Trump has also exploited many Americans’ economic anxieties, tapping the same anti-immigrant, anti-elite rage that is sweeping across European countries. But Trump cannot win by appealing only to white men without a college degree.
So he has been clumsily trying to suggest that he also cares about African Americans and Latinos – not by talking to African-American and Latino voters, but by speaking in exaggerated stereotypes about them to white audiences.
Not surprisingly, African-Americans and Latinos consider his comments insensitive and patronizing; white women – his real target audience – haven’t yet been persuaded, either.
Meanwhile, Clinton is having her own difficulties reconstructing President Barack Obama’s coalition of women, African Americans, Latinos, and millennials.
Many young people who passionately supported Clinton’s Democratic primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, have ignored Sanders’s own admonitions to support Clinton, and are saying that they’ll vote for third-party candidates, which would help Trump.
Since the two major parties’ national conventions in July, each candidate has alternately made gains and suffered losses.
This month, just as Trump was rising in the polls, he attempted to separate himself from the racist “birther” movement, which falsely claims that Obama – America’s first black president – wasn’t born in the United States, and thus was ineligible for the presidency.
Trump’s remarks, terse and grudging, reminded everyone that he himself was one of the loudest “birthers” of all.
His damage-control effort further backfired, because he falsely claimed that Clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign had started the birther rumor.
Many news outlets finally used the word “lie” in their coverage of Trump, who had gone essentially unchallenged on past fabrications.
Trump’s recent polling gains say less about his improvement as a candidate than they do about Clinton’s own weaknesses and bad luck.
Outside her base of passionate loyalists, Clinton has always had a voter-enthusiasm problem.
She comes across to many as a packaged know-it-all, the super-smart girl who put off the boys in school.
And she confronts a fair amount of sexism, even among her supporters.
(A former Democratic governor recently declared that she should smile more.
Would he have said that about a man?)
But Clinton has also created some of her own problems.
Her poor judgment in using a private email server as Secretary of State, thereby risking the disclosure of classified material, has become a chronic burden for her campaign.
She compounded the problem when she claimed, falsely, that her predecessors had done the same thing, and that State Department security officials had cleared it.
And, unlike Trump, she received no deference from the press on this issue.
The email saga added to voters’ long-held impression that Clinton isn’t “honest and trustworthy,” and it exposed her to attacks from adversaries on the right.
The highly conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch has continually called attention to the issue, forcing the disclosure of emails that Clinton hadn’t turned over to the State Department.
(The FBI found nearly 15,000 emails on Clinton’s server that she hadn’t provided.) Numerous as-yet-undisclosed emails with the potential to damage Clinton may well be released before the election.
While FBI Director James Comey decided not to recommend prosecution of Clinton for the email issue, he hurt her campaign by commenting that she’d been “extremely careless.”
In any case, the choice not to prosecute had Republicans and conservative commentators howling that she’d received preferential treatment from the Democratic administration.
Polls showed that 56% of respondents agreed that Clinton should have been prosecuted.
A new issue for Clinton arose in August, when the Associated Press reported that numerous donors to the Clinton Foundation had received special treatment by the State Department during Clinton’s tenure there, mainly by winning an appointment with her.
But many of these people would have received an appointment anyway; and there is no evidence that State Department policies were changed as a result.
Meanwhile, the Washington Post has begun to report on questionable – possibly illegal – expenditures by Trump’s own charitable foundation.
Trump, who hadn’t donated to his foundation since 2008, subsequently used its funds to buy personal items (including a six-foot portrait of himself) and to pay legal settlements.
Previously, it had also been disclosed that funds from the Trump Foundation had been used to contribute to the election campaigns of attorneys-general in Florida and Texas, which would also be illegal.
Finally, Clinton had the bad luck of falling ill, with cellphone video showing her nearly collapsing as she left early a ceremony in New York City commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.
This added further fuel to right-wing media speculation that she is in poor health; Trump added the sexist charge that she lacks the “stamina” to be president.
The press covering Clinton were furious to learn that twodays earlier she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had kept it to herself.
But American presidential elections are brutal marathons, and it’s understandable that she did not want to cancel planned events.
A later poll showed that the majority of the public agreed.
Clinton’s four-day convalescence came just as she was preparing to make the case for why people should vote for her, rather than why they shouldn’t vote for Trump.
Just as she resumed campaigning, there were bombings in New York and New Jersey, and two more police shootings of unarmed African Americans, which spurred demonstrations in North Carolina, a swing state.
The events took over the national dialogue, with Trump, as usual, playing on racial divisions and blaming Obama and Clinton.
This is the background against which the candidates will head into face-to-face debates, which tend to play a large (even excessive) role in shaping US elections.
It would be unwise to call this election over before it is.

Brexit’s Impact on the World Economy
LONDON – The febrile behavior of financial markets ahead of the United Kingdom’s referendum on June 23 on whether to remain in the European Union shows that the outcome will influence economic and political conditions around the world far more profoundly than Britain’s roughly 2.4% share of global GDP might suggest.
There are three reasons for this outsize impact.
First, the “Brexit” referendum is part of a global phenomenon: populist revolts against established political parties, predominantly by older, poorer, or less-educated voters angry enough to tear down existing institutions and defy “establishment” politicians and economic experts.
Indeed, the demographic profile of potential Brexit voters is strikingly similar to that of American supporters of Donald Trump and French adherents of the National Front.
Opinion polls indicate that British voters back the “Leave”campaign by a wide margin, 65% to 35%, if they did not complete high school, are over 60, or have “D, E” blue-collar occupations. By contrast, university graduates, voters under 40, and members of the “A, B” professional classes plan to vote “Remain” by similar margins of 60% to 40% and higher.
In Britain, the United States, and Germany, the populist rebellions are not only fueled by similar perceived grievances and nationalist sentiments, but also are occurring in similar economic conditions.
All three countries have returned to more or less full employment, with unemployment rates of around 5%.
But many of the jobs created pay low wages, and immigrants have recently displaced bankers as scapegoats for all social ills.
The degree of mistrust of business leaders, mainstream politicians, and expert economists is evident in the extent to which voters are ignoring their warnings not to endanger the gradual restoration of prosperity by upending the status quo.
In Britain, after three months of debate about Brexit, only 37% of voters agree that Britain would be worse off economically if it left the EU – down from 38% a year ago.
In other words, all the voluminous reports – by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the World Bank, and the British government and the Bank of England – unanimously warning of significant losses from Brexit have been disregarded.
Rather than trying to rebut the experts’ warnings with detailed analyses, Boris Johnson, the leader of the Leave campaign, has responded with bluster and rhetoric identical to Trump’s anti-politics: “Who is remotely apprehensive about leaving?
Oh believe me, it will be fine.”
In other words, the so-called experts were wrong in the past, and they are wrong now.
This kind of frontal attack on political elites has been surprisingly successful in Britain, judging by the latest Brexit polling.
But only after the votes are counted will we know whether opinions expressed to pollsters predicted actual voting behavior.
This is the second reason why the Brexit result will echo around the world.
The referendum will be the first big test of whether it is the experts and markets, or the opinion polls, that have been closer to the truth about the strength of the populist upsurge.
For now, political pundits and financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic assume, perhaps complacently, that what angry voters tell pollsters does not reflect how they will actually vote.
Analysts and investors have consistently assigned low odds to insurgent victories: in late May, betting markets and computerized models put the probabilities of Trump’s election and of Brexit at only around 25%, despite the fact that opinion polls showed almost 50% support for both.
If Brexit wins on June 23, the low odds accorded by experts and financial markets to successful populist revolts in America and Europe will immediately look suspect, while the higher probabilities suggested by opinion polls will gain greater credibility.
This is not because US voters will be influenced by Britain; of course they will not be.
But, in addition to all the economic, demographic, and social similarities, opinion polling in the US and Britain now face very similar challenges and uncertainties, owing to the breakdown of traditional political allegiances and dominant two-party systems.
Statistical theory even allows us to quantify how expectations about the US presidential election should shift if Brexit wins in Britain.
Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that we start by giving equal credibility to opinion polls showing Brexit and Trump with almost 50% support and expert opinions, which gave them only a 25% chance.
Now suppose that Brexit wins.
A statistical formula called Bayes’ theorem then shows that belief in opinion polls would increase from 50% to 67%, while the credibility of expert opinion would fall from 50% to 33%.
This leads to the third, and most worrying, implication of the British vote.
If Brexit wins in a country as stable and politically phlegmatic as Britain, financial markets and businesses around the world will be shaken out of their complacency about populist insurgencies in the rest of Europe and the US.
These heightened market concerns will, in turn, change economic reality. As in 2008, financial markets will amplify economic anxiety, breeding more anti-establishment anger and fueling still-higher expectations of political revolt.
The threat of such contagion means a Brexit vote could be the catalyst for another global crisis. This time, however, the workers who lose their jobs, the pensioners who lose their savings, and the homeowners who are trapped in negative equity will not be able to blame “the bankers.”
Those who vote for populist upheavals will have no one but themselves to blame when their revolutions go wrong.

A Future Without Currency Wars?
PRINCETON – The terrible experience of the 1930s should remind us that trade and currency wars go together like a horse and carriage.
Now that US President Donald Trump’s administration is fully implementing his protectionist “America First” agenda, it is only a matter of time before a currency conflict erupts.
There has not been a full-scale currency war in quite some time, though the world came close after the 2008 financial crisis, when then-Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega used the term to describe America’s extraordinarily low interest rates.
Following the United States, Japan and Europe seemed to adopt similar strategies of export promotion, and a depreciated exchange rate became an unheralded but central feature of economic recovery in advanced economies.
Similarly, after 2012, the euro crisis started to look more manageable only after the euro began depreciating against the dollar.
And as many economists in the United Kingdom had already pointed out, a flexible exchange rate had given the UK, in contrast to the eurozone countries, a uniquely effective tool for managing the shocks of the period.
At any rate, the post-crisis currency concerns soon faded, owing largely to the major central banks’ simultaneous pursuit of quantitative easing (QE), which just so happened to affect exchange rates.
The first potential currency war of the twenty-first century gave way to an indecisive and fragile truce.
But if any major economy were to adopt protectionism to gain an advantage over others, the currency question would come back to the fore.
After all, in the hands of policymakers so inclined, national currencies are an obvious economic weapon.
That is why the 44 countries that participated in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference agreed on a framework to ensure stable exchange rates.
The US held the dominant negotiating position, and it was committed to establishing an open international order free of tariffs and trade wars.
For every other country, there was no real choice but to settle on an exchange rate that would allow it to maintain a roughly balanced external account.
Since then, the threat of a trade war has always implied the return of the currency debate.
In today’s escalating conflict, it was inevitable that Trump would eventually focus on other countries’ monetary policies.
He has long accused China of undervaluing its currency (even when it has been doing precisely the opposite).
And in response to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s recent announcement of a new round of QE, Trump tweeted, “They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.”
As in the 1930s, currency warfare is attractive to those who view geopolitics as a zero-sum game. Trump’s attacks on the ECB are partly about trade, but they are also meant to drive a wedge between EU member states.
As critics of the European monetary regime have long complained, Germany enjoys a lower external exchange rate with the euro than it would have had with the Deutschmark.
And in Trump’s view, Germany maintains a mercantilist policy to favor its own exporters, although the US-led Bretton Woods order was designed precisely to prevent mercantilism and its attendant competitive devaluations.
Still, in the view of John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of Bretton Woods, the postwar arrangement should have gone much further, by including institutional checks to penalize countries with large surpluses or deficits.
Penalizing trade imbalances would have gone hand in hand with his plan for a new global monetary system, which would have been based on a universal synthetic currency called “bancor” (a French compound word for bank-created gold).
As Draghi pointed out in the speech that attracted Trump’s ire, the euro was originally framed as a mechanism for eliminating competitive devaluations.
Ever since Keynes, efforts to revive the idea of a non-national general currency – such as that by the economist Robert A. Mundell in the 1960s – had been constant and futile.
But now, new technology has brought the possibility of a global currency within reach.
Just last month, Facebook unveiled its plans for a digital coin, Libra, which will be pegged to a basket of government-issued currencies.
According to Facebook, the initiative is designed to reach the world’s poorest people, including many of the 1.7 billion without a bank account.
A broad user base is essential to ensure that Libra serves primarily as a means of exchange, not as a tool of financial speculation.
That makes it the antithesis of first-generation blockchain currencies such as Bitcoin, which is subject to artificial scarcity maintained through the process of “mining.”
To be sure, the overwhelmingly negative reaction to Facebook’s Libra announcement has been discouraging. And yet, were an alternative currency based on multiple assets broadly adopted, it would not be as destabilizing as its critics claim.
With a truly universal currency, users would both buy and sell goods and services, including labor, which means that wages would have to be set in a non-national currency. The new dispensation would make the existence of multiple currencies in one territory look like a throwback to the pre-modern world, when gold and silver coins fluctuated in value against each other.
And that might not be a bad outcome.
The fluctuation in value of gold and silver, it is worth remembering, allowed for greater wage flexibility, and thus less unemployment.
And the wider the use of a global currency (or multiple global currencies), the less viable a currency war becomes.
Technology is reviving the twentieth-century dream of a global monetary system free of the disruptions caused by economic nationalism.
The key to realizing it is to sever the link – as the euro has begun to do – between money and the nation-state.

The End of Fiscal Sovereignty in Europe
MILAN – The late Milton Friedman said that a common currency – that is, a monetary union – cannot be sustained without a deep form of economic and political union.
By this, he meant an open economy that ensures the free flow of goods, labor, and capital, together with a disciplined central fiscal authority and a strong central bank.
The latter two are pillars of a strong currency.
They work in tandem.
But the other pieces are no less important.
The eurozone, currently wrestling with fiscal imbalance and sovereign debt risk, has a strong and autonomous central bank, but is fiscally fragmented and only partly unified politically.
Enter the Maastricht Treaty, which in theory imposes fiscal discipline by placing limits on government deficits and debt levels – clearly a structure designed to prevent free riding on the fiscal discipline of others. Maastricht was thus intended to prevent a situation like the current one in Greece.
It didn’t work.
Eurozone sovereign debt turned out not to be homogenous with respect to risk.
In a stable world, Maastricht Treaty’s rules-based framework, if enforced, might do the job. But in a shock-prone world, it is a fragile system, because it precludes anything but modest countercyclical policy.
No wonder, then, that the treaty’s strict limits were breached early in the euro’s first decade bycore countries as well as peripheral ones.
Indeed, with a large shock, much of the breach happens automatically, as tax revenues shrink and social-insurance payments expand.
Recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund suggests that as much as 80% of the fiscal stimulus in advanced countries during the current crisis is non-discretionary.
That kind of built-in counter-cyclicality is not a bad thing.
But if it produces the threat of fiscal instability and excessive sovereign-debt risk after a large shock, then the starting point was not sufficiently conservative – in other words, deficits or debt levels (or both) were too high. Counter-cyclicality does not mean running modest deficits in the good times and huge deficits in major downturns.
If the current EU budget rules are too rigid and are ignored in the face of a shock, then the door is open for imprudent fiscal behavior.
In theory, strict in-depth monitoring could distinguish genuinely prudent countercyclical responses from profligacy.
But in practice it is hard to enforce.
The eurozone’s immediate challenge is declining fiscal stability in a subset of countries whose credit ratings are falling and debt-service costs rising.
Absent external assistance and a credible plan for restoring fiscal order, Greek sovereign debt could not be rolled over, forcing a default, probably in the form of a restructuring of Greek debt. Even with external assistance, many view default as a near certainty, because the arithmetic of restoring fiscal balance is so daunting.
Eurozone membership precludes inflation and devaluation as adjustment mechanisms.
An alternative is domestic deflation combined with extreme fiscal tightening – that is, a period of slow or negative growth in wages, incomes, and some prices of non-traded goods.
But deflation is painful and cannot realistically be pursued for political reasons.
The constraints for eurozone countries are similar to those of a state in America that gets into fiscal trouble.
Devaluation is not an option because of the common currency.
The Federal Reserve will not willingly resort to inflation.
Moreover, in the United States, there are rules and conventions (similar to Maastricht) that disallow or discourage states from running long-term deficits.
This means that state fiscal behavior tends to be pro-cyclical in the face of large shocks like the recent one.
So why isn’t a federal system equally fragile?
There are two key safety valves.
One is the central government’s ability to run deficits and to act decisively.
The other is labor mobility.
The EU does not have a robust centralized fiscal structure with a counter-cyclical mandate.
And labor mobility, a long-run goal in the EU, is constrained by language, laws, and diverse regulatory regimes.
In addition, state bonds are not treated as equals, and the markets penalize profligate states.
If the EU wants a monetary union in which sovereign debt is relatively homogenous with respect to risk, fiscal discipline must be similarly homogenous.
But that also means that it will need a more robust mechanism for countercyclical responses to shocks.
The EU’s leaders recently stated their intention to revisit the Maastricht structure, which in principle is a good idea.
They might take the route of adapting the Maastricht rules to allow for more inter-temporal flexibility at the national level.
But that approach would be complicated.
One would need a sophisticated capability for monitoring and enforcing fiscal policy and sovereign debt – or else end up with a repeat of the current situation.
A better long-term solution is a central EU fiscal capacity that accumulates the resources to respond to shocks during periods of growth.
One could think of it as a stabilization tax that becomes negative in downturns.
But a move in this direction does involve some degree of fiscal centralization.
And it probably would require that the EU be able to issue sovereign debt.
It is unclear whether there is the political will to do all that.
But a step in the right direction could be taken by partial fiscal centralization with a limited countercyclical mandate.
That would enable effective enforcement of fiscal discipline at the national level and provide the euro with the fiscal discipline it needs to survive.
When the eurozone was created, it was widely understood that fiscal discipline was a crucial underpinning.
The current crisis vividly underscores the point.
The challenge now is to achieve a combination of discipline and flexibility that protects the collective interest.
That will involve a loss of full fiscal sovereignty, but facing up to that reality is required to sustain the monetary union.

A New Tone in US-China Relations?
HONG KONG – Donald Trump has left the White House, but Trumpism has not left US politics.
With Joe Biden as America’s president, the world hopes that the United States will shift away from Trump’s disruptive confrontational approach toward China relations and embark on a path of pragmatic engagement.
At stake is whether this crucial bilateral relationship serves to strengthen or shatter the global order.
Trump and COVID-19 have together provided painful but essential tests of both national well-being and the concept of an interconnected global order.
Trump viewed globalization as a hindrance to America’s national aspirations.
But the pandemic proved that we live in an interconnected global society.
Systemic threats like the pandemic are beyond any country’s power to resolve.
If we neglect the health and livelihoods of the world’s poorest, the coronavirus will mutate and come back to haunt us, even in the richest walled-in community.
Trumpism stood squarely against this reality, embracing the view that only nation-states or the elites who control them can address global problems.
That “partialist” assumption is also shared by conventional defense and security strategists, who typically take national primacy for granted, resulting in zero-sum outcomes like the so-called Thucydides Trap.
But all threats to human security arise endogenously from the interaction of the world’s parts.
As the ecologists Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi observed in their 2014 book The Systems View of Life, “the major problems of our time are systemic problems – all interconnected and interdependent.”
Accordingly, “they require systemic solutions.”
Yet, systemic solutions fall into collective-action traps, because the parts will not work together to solve the problems of the whole.
Ecologists are not nationalists, because they recognize that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.
In 1981, the American futurologist R. Buckminster Fuller pointed out that humanity was treading a “critical path” between mutually assured nuclear destruction and extinction caused by a warming climate. Forty years later, the world is running out of time to address rising temperatures and sea levels, increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters, and widening man-made inequalities.
Thankfully, Trump showed that partialist solutions do not work.
America First is America Alone.
No country, even one as mighty as the US, can manage domestic crises without the resources that can come only from a global economic recovery.
Chinese policymakers have learned from bitter experience that their country cannot solve global problems on its own, either.
For example, China’s 2009 reflation, which helped the world recover from the 2008 global financial crisis, resulted in huge domestic costs.
Whereas partialists divide the world into countries, classes, and creeds, globalists realize that man and nature are one.
Humanity is more than one class, race, or creed, and there may be no perfect solution to a partial problem, only continuous hard work on what matters for all.
Could recognizing and trying to bridge this mental divide be the key to mutual understanding between the West and China?
In his book A History of Civilizations, the great French historian Fernand Braudel quoted the French sinologist Marcel Granet. “The Chinese are either superstitious or practical, or rather they are both at once,” Granet said.
“It is this ‘both at once’ that a Westerner often finds hard to grasp.”
Some Western thinkers have of course understood such dualities.
The economist Joseph Schumpeter, for example, observed that markets derived their dynamism from entrepreneurial “creative destruction.”
This “both at once” worldview suggests that partial, linear, zero-sum, and monist perspectives misunderstand today’s interconnected global society.
America worries that China may usurp global leadership, while China is concerned that the US is blocking its modernization. This dynamic has fueled rising insecurity in the world’s two biggest economies, creating potentially fertile ground for further confrontation, and even a military conflict.
The real question is not what the Chinese call “Project Hope” – a wish list that cannot be realized – but rather how best to manage the tough trade-offs needed to deliver the peace and prosperity that all the world’s people want.
The pandemic convinced the Chinese that their country’s one-party system, however imperfect it may be, learned and adapted faster in combating the disease than an America poorly managed by Trump did.
In fact, the Communist Party of China now treats global competition and criticism as a form of policy feedback. In some ways, this makes the rest of the world a de facto “opposition party” pushing the CPC to maintain its performance and legitimacy.
This strategic realism has enabled China to move forward with a number of new forms of international engagement, including the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with the European Union, and China’s pledge to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2060.
China’s so-called “dual-circulation strategy” is a signal to Biden that Chinese leaders are open to strategic cooperation in tackling climate change, addressing the pandemic, and restoring global trade and investment so that each country has more resources to address domestic inequalities and imbalances.
In the real world, cooperation and competition can co-exist.
Both the US and Chinese governments must start to understand that such an approach is the only way forward to foster sustainability and resilience.
And, like in all conversations, the first step can set the tone.
Presidents Biden and Xi Jinping, both chastened by four years of Trumpian disruption, have a real chance to reverse course.

Islamic Evangelism
Many believe that religious revival and political radicalism among Muslims who reside in the West reflects the traditions and conflicts of the Middle East or the wider Muslim world.
But Islamic Salafism (fundamentalist religious radicalism) is above all a consequence of the globalization and Westernization of Islam, and of the decoupling of culture and religion more generally.
All forms of religious fundamentalism rely on the notion of a "pure" religion independent of cultural variations and influences.
Today's Islamic revival shares the dogmatism, communitarianism, and scripturalism of American evangelist movements: both reject culture, philosophy, and even theology to favor a literalist reading of sacred texts and an immediate understanding of truth through individual faith.
Recent books published in the West reflect this, with titles like What is Islam? , What Does It Mean To Be A Muslim? , and How To Experience Islam?
It is easy to fast during Ramadan in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Egypt, even if one does not want to.
But a Muslim living in Europe is confronted with the necessity of objectifying the religion.
Ulemas (religious scholars) are useless for believers who must search for purely religious criteria that are no longer linked to a given culture.
The real issue is not a theoretical question about Islam, but concerns the religious practices of Muslims.
The forms of religiosity in Islam today are more or less the same as those found in Catholicism, Protestantism, and even Judaism.
Contemporary adherents insist more on personal faith and individual spiritual experience.
Such "born again" believers rebuild their identities through their rediscovery of religion.
With Islamic fundamentalism, too, we are not witnessing a traditional religion asserting itself against the Christian West.
When the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 1996, they initially had excellent relations with the Americans, and Westerners could travel freely in Afghanistan between 1996 and 1998.
The Taliban were not fighting Western culture, but traditional Afghan culture.
Why forbid owning songbirds?
Why ban kites?
The rationale is common to all forms of fundamentalism: this world exists to prepare believers for salvation.
The state's role is not to ensure social justice and the rule of law, but to create opportunities - even through coercion - for believers to find salvation.
The Taliban's argument was simple: if your bird starts singing while you are praying, you will be distracted and your prayer will be nullified.
If you are a good Muslim, you will start again from the beginning.
But, because we are unsure that you are a good Muslim, it is easier to forbid owning songbirds, so that they cannot jeopardize your salvation.
Similarly, kites get tangled in trees, and if you climb the tree to free it, you might look over your neighbor's wall and see a woman without her veil, which would put you in sin.
Why risk burning in hell for a kite?
Better to ban them.
Fundamentalism is thus not a protest by original cultures under threat; it reflects these cultures' disappearance.
So it is a grave mistake to link modern forms of fundamentalism with the idea of a clash of civilizations.
Young people do not become fundamentalists because their parents' culture is ignored by Western civilization.
Fundamentalist religiosity is individual and generational, a rebellion against the religion of one's parents.
Of course, religious fundamentalists of whatever stripe often emphasize similar codes, norms, and values.
When Pim Fortuyn in Holland decided to wage a campaign against Muslim influence, he was defending sexual freedom, not traditional Christian values.
But on this subject and others - say, family and abortion - religious Muslims in Europe side with conservative Christians.
Nevertheless, such commonalities do not explain political and radical Islam.
Osama Bin Laden is much more the expression of deracination than of a tradition of political violence in Islam.
Muhammad Atta, Zacharias Moussaoui, and Kamel Daoudi were "born again" in Marseilles, London, and Montreal, not in Egypt or Morocco (and they all broke ties with their families).
Moreover, young radicals go to fight in Bosnia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, or Kashmir rather than in their countries of origin, because they do not regard the Middle East as the heart of a Muslim civilization under siege by crusaders.
They live in a global world; they do not perceive themselves as Middle Easterners.
The irrelevance of traditional culture explains the growing number of converts in all the recently discovered radical networks.
The members of the Beghal network in France were roughly one-third converts.
The French police arrested a German citizen with a Polish name in connection with the terrorist attack on the synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia.
Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a British airplane, José Padilla, accused of plotting a "dirty bomb" attack in the United States, and John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban, are all converts.
In Europe, conversion is typically confined to underprivileged neighborhoods, populated by young people with no job prospects who generally live in an underground economy of delinquency.
The radical and violent left in Europe today has abandoned these zones of social exclusion.
Radicals used to learn to handle a Kalashnikov and hijack planes with the Palestinians.
Now they learn to handle a Kalashnikov and hijack planes with Al Qaeda.
Their quest for mythic, messianic, transnational movements of liberation remains the same, as does the enemy: America's imperial colossus.
They are the product not of Western or Middle Eastern history, but the fusion of all histories, of globalization.
They are at home in a homeless world.

The Face of Evil
NEW YORK – Standing with Slobodan Milosevic 13 years ago on the veranda of a government hunting lodge outside Belgrade, I saw two men in the distance.
They left their twin Mercedes and, in fading light, started toward us.
I felt a jolt go through my body; they were unmistakable.
Ratko Mladic, in combat fatigues, stocky, walking as though through a muddy field; and Radovan Karadzic, taller, wearing a suit, with his wild, but carefully coiffed, shock of white hair.
The capture of Karadzic and his arrival at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague took me back to a long night of confrontation, drama, and negotiations – the only time I ever met him.
It was 5 p.m. on September 13, 1995, during the height of the war in Bosnia.
After years of weak Western and United Nations response to Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, United States-led NATO bombing had put the Serbs on the defensive.
Our small diplomatic negotiating team was trying to end a war that had taken the lives of nearly 300,000 people.
Milosevic, Mladic, and Karadzic were the primary reason for that war.
Mladic and Karadzic had already been indicted as war criminals by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
(Milosevic was not to be indicted until 1999.)
In a change of strategy, the negotiating team had decided to marginalize Karadzic and Mladic and to force Milosevic, as the senior Serb in the region, to take responsibility for the war and for the negotiations that we hoped would end it.
Now Milosevic wanted to bring the two men back into the discussions, probably to take some of the pressure off of himself.
We had anticipated this moment and agreed in advance that, while we would never ask to meet with Karadzic and Mladic, if Milosevic offered such a meeting, we would accept – but only once, and only under strict guidelines that would require Milosevic to be responsible for their behavior.
I told each member of our negotiating team to decide for himself or herself whether to shake hands with the mass murderers.
I hated these men for what they had done.
Their crimes included, indirectly, the deaths of three of our colleagues – Bob Frasure, Joe Kruzel, and Nelson Drew, who had died when the armored personnel carrier they were in plunged down a ravine as we attempted to reach Sarajevo by the only route available, a dangerous dirt road that went through sniper-filled, Serbian-controlled territory.
I did not shake hands, although both Karadzic and Mladic tried to.
Some of our team did; others did not.
Mladic, not Karadzic, was the dominant figure that evening.
He engaged in staring contests with some of our team as we sat across the table.
Karadzic was silent at first.
He had a large face with heavy jowls, a soft chin, and surprisingly gentle eyes.
When he heard our demand that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately, he exploded.
Rising from the table, the American-educated Karadzic raged in passable English about the “humiliations” his people were suffering.
I reminded Milosevic that he had promised that such harangues would not occur.
Karadzic responded emotionally that he would call former President Jimmy Carter, with whom he said he was in touch, and started to leave.
For the only time that long night, I addressed Karadzic directly, telling him that we worked only for President Bill Clinton and that he could call Carter if he wished but that we would leave and that the bombing would intensify.
Milosevic said something to Karadzic in Serbian; he sat down again, and the meeting got down to business.
After ten hours, we reached an agreement that would end the siege, after more than three years of war.
The next day, we were able to fly into the reopened airfield in Sarajevo.
That indomitable city was already beginning to come back to life.
Two months later, the war would end at Dayton, never to resume.
But while the Dayton agreement gave NATO the authority to capture Karadzic and Mladic, an arrest didn’t occur for nearly 13 years.
During that period, Karadzic spread a completely false rumor that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and I had made a deal that, with Karadzic’s disappearance from public view, NATO would not seek his arrest.
Of course, this another ridiculous fabrication from the same man who famously said that the Bosnian Muslims had shelled their own villages in order to lure NATO into the war.
Finally, one of these dreadful murderers is in The Hague.
It is imperative that Mladic follow Karadzic on this one-way journey.
Karadzic’s capture is all the more important because Serbian authorities accomplished it.
Serbian President Boris Tadic deserves great credit for this action, especially since his good friend Zoran Djindjic, then prime minister of Serbia, was assassinated in 2003 as a direct result of his courage in arresting Milosevic and sending him to The Hague in 2001.
Karadzic’s arrest is no mere historical footnote; it removes from the scene a man who was still undermining peace and progress in the Balkans and whose enthusiastic advocacy of ethnic cleansing merits emphatic repudiation.
It also moves Serbia closer to European Union membership.
Moreover, Karadzic’s arrest is another reminder of the value of war crimes tribunals.
Even though almost 13 years is an inexcusably long time, the war crimes indictment kept Karadzic on the run and prevented him from resurfacing.
In far-away Khartoum, Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, now indicted by the International Criminal Court, should be paying close attention.

Beyond the Two-State Solution
NEW HAVEN – As the turmoil in the Middle East worsens, the fate of the Palestinians seems to have been put on the diplomatic back burner.
Indeed, the two-state solution has been on life-support since Israel’s 2014 Operation Protective Edge in Gaza, despite US Secretary of State John Kerry’s heroic efforts to revive it.
Many in the region, and elsewhere, now believe that it is dead.
But that raises a new problem.
With statehood seemingly out of reach, it will be only a matter of time before large numbers of Palestinians begin demanding the right to vote in Israeli elections.
That fight will be intense.
Israelis embraced the idea of two states for so long partly to keep Palestinian enfranchisement off the table.
How can the emerging order become more inclusive and legitimate?
Elements of a constructive way forward are hiding in plain sight.
Shortly after Israel signed its 1994 peace treaty with Jordan, then-Foreign Minister Shimon Peres proposed a cross-border joint economic zone to solidify the agreement.
This became the Jordan Gateway Industrial Park (JGIP), a 346-acre special economic zone (SEZ) occupying the Israeli and Jordanian banks of the Jordan River near Haifa.
Championed by Israeli industrialist Shlomi Fogel, the JGIP has recently experienced marked growth.
Israel’s government contributed $34 million in 2013. Jordan, which has largely directed the project since 2001, provides ongoing fiscal support.
As with SEZs elsewhere around the world, the industries in the park are exempt from taxes and tariffs and enjoy other economic benefits.
This model should be expanded to include special political zones (SPZs) that erode divisions between Israelis and Palestinians.
SPZs could be created along the borders between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza.
They should be more fully integrated than the JGIP, which depends on outside labor.
People in the SPZs would effectively constitute themselves as microcosms of a new order.
SPZ businesses could be owned by Israelis, Palestinians, or jointly, and workers would come from both sides of the divide.
But everyone would have to live in the SPZ, in which they would receive ownership shares and governance roles that would grow in proportion to the length of their tenure.
SPZs should enjoy high degrees of political autonomy from the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority.
Residential infrastructure, from schools to municipal services and medical facilities, would be built in the zones, making them substantially self-sufficient.
Day-to-day governance would be left to residents, who would have an economic interest in the SPZ’s vitality, as well as incentives to sustain integrated binational communities.
Co-Op City, the largest residential complex in the United States, is a suggestive model.
Directed by a community-based corporation, Co-Op City contains schools, stores, and private law enforcement.
Such common-interest housing developments (CIDs) have grown in the US in recent years.
Part of the attraction is enhanced participation.
In the Middle East, such arrangements could foster new forms of inter-ethnic cooperation.
Security would be a major concern.
Initially, SPZ perimeters would have checkpoints like those for crossing into the West Bank and Gaza.
But people would not need to come and go on a daily basis, an albatross that has bedeviled cross-border SEZs until now.
Autonomous forces, similar to those employed by CIDs and university campuses, would maintain internal order.
This differs from the JGIP, where Israel and Jordan maintain control over their respective spheres on either side of the Jordan River.
SPZs should be located near transportation on both sides of the border, but away from religious shrines, settlements, and strategically important military installations.
Possible sites include the once-planned Khaddourie industrial park between Tulkarem in the West Bank and Herzliya, and the Karni Industrial Zone outside Gaza City.
The idea need not be sold to electorates or extremists to go forward.
Nor need it uproot people.
SPZs will be attractive to those who are hungry for constructive alternatives to the prevailing political stagnation and the inexorable, demography-driven drift toward Israeli apartheid.
Those who move into SPZs would be actively committed to making them work.
If the early SPZs succeed, there will be pressure to create others.
Indeed, cross-border SPZs might eventually be replicated within the occupied territories and in Israel proper, including cities like Ramallah and Tel Aviv.
Much will depend on the communities that the residents create.
But outsiders can help.
As with the JGIP, SPZs would provide opportunities for investors from the region and beyond to contribute to, and profit from, peace.
They would receive local tax breaks, and maybe also support from their own governments.
The US could take the lead, as it has done with SEZs in Egypt and Jordan.
Governments and philanthropists could provide seed grants.
As with the JGIP, the goal should be to model best practices that others will want to imitate.
There are already serious players poised to become SPZ entrepreneurs.
Fogel belongs to Breaking the Impasse (BTI), a group of prominent Palestinian and Israeli business leaders committed to advancing peace.
Established by Palestinian magnate Munib al-Masri and Israeli tech billionaire Yossi Vardi in July 2012, BTI has some 300 members, whose companies account for at least 30% of Israeli and Palestinian GDP.
In other words, they have the influence and resources to instigate a first wave of SPZs.
The first SPZs must demonstrate that a marriage of economics and politics can induce collaboration that would not be possible otherwise. Israel’s government and the Palestinian Authority must play facilitating roles.
But they will mostly be in the back seat of a venture driven by entrepreneurs, external friends of regional peace, and – most important – the individual Palestinians and Israelis who make the sweat-equity commitment to become a new kind of pioneer for peace.
If they succeed, the death of the two-state solution might prove to be a blessing in disguise.

The Central-Bank Song Remains the Same
LONDON – The changing of the guard that is taking place at the systemically important central banks in 2018-2019 will mark the beginning of a new era of monetary policy.
Who is likely to lead this transition to a “new normal”?
More important, just how new will it really be?
In the decade since the global financial crisis, advanced-country central banks have adopted unprecedentedly active monetary policies.
The Bank of Japan’s Haruhiko Kuroda and the European Central Bank’s Mario Draghi maintain such policies to this day, in order to stimulate economic activity and counter deflationary pressures.
By contrast, the US Federal Reserve, beginning under former Chair Janet Yellen, and the Bank of England, under Mark Carney, have been laying the groundwork for policy “normalization.”
Another systemically important central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has focused not on monetary expansion, but on financial reform.
Former PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan built a strong reputation domestically and, perhaps more so, internationally during his record-setting 15-year tenure, owing to his gradual, steady, and effective approach.
Although the PBOC’s lack of official independence means that his authority to set interest rates was constrained by the advice of the 15-member Monetary Policy Committee, this did not affect Zhou’s ability to put in place the foundations of a financial sector befitting the world’s largest economy.
Yet, even as central banks face important transitions, the choices of their new leaders have reflected a desire for continuity.
Most obvious, Kuroda has been confirmed for another five-year term at the BOJ, and Zhou was replaced in March by his own deputy governor, Yi Gang.
Even Yellen’s successor, Jerome Powell, will probably amount to more of the same.
Of course, Powell was initially presented as a break from the past.
After all, if President Donald Trump had wanted to remain on the same path, he would have just selected Yellen for a second term (which would have been more in line with tradition).
But, in Trump’s view, the Democrat Yellen was a vestige of Barack Obama’s administration, and thus had to be replaced with a declared Republican like Powell.
But both Powell and Yellen are Fed veterans, and seem to be following the same normalization path.
In Europe, the changes brought by the new governors are likely to be more significant.
At the BoE, Carney – who announced in November 2016 his intention to cut short his term – will remain in the job until a few months after the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in March 2019, in order to minimize any market disruption.
But Carney’s replacement is likely to represent a significant departure.
Despite his impeccable track record as the governor of Canada’s central bank, Carney’s appointment was controversial: he has always been perceived as too close to the previous chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, and insufficiently sympathetic to Brexiteers.
Carney’s successor will thus have to be congenial, if not amenable, to Brexit’s champions.
In a sense, however, Carney’s replacement will amount to the restoration of the status quo.
After all, when Carney was “imported,” he was disrupting the tradition of in-house appointments – a tradition that will be revitalized if, as seems likely, one of the BoE’s current deputy governors is named as his replacement.
Perhaps the most profound shift will happen at the ECB, where four top posts will need to be filled by the end of next year.
The recent nomination of former Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos to serve as ECB vice president offers some clues regarding what to expect.
In particular, the choice of a Spanish vice president (which in Guindos’s case represents a break with the tradition – intended to protect central-bank independence – of not appointing politicians) suggests that the next president will come from the northern eurozone.
Of the eurozone’s three largest economies, only Germany has never held the presidency.
If the presidency goes to a German, that German will most likely be Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann.
A monetary hawk, Weidmann will struggle to win southern countries’ support.
Moreover, his nomination will trigger the resignation of another German, Sabine Lautenschläger, the only woman on the ECB’s executive board.
The prospect of an exclusively male board – not to mention the fact that no woman was even short-listed for the presidency – will not go down well with the European Parliament.
The European Parliament’s preference for greater gender parity is surely welcome, though it is probably based more on a desire to avoid criticism than a genuine commitment to diversity. And, in fact, with their selections for the top jobs, all central banks are failing in this respect, even though diversity is now viewed, in many institutional contexts, as an indicator of good performance.
In short, central-bank leadership remains an “old boys’ club.”
As we enter a new era for monetary policy, we should be seeking to overhaul central-bank leadership in a more fundamental way.
The lack of diversity among candidates for the top jobs suggests that the selection process is far too narrow and inward-looking.
Central banks ought to be cultivating younger people, women, and minorities, in order to broaden the range of approaches, skills, perspectives, and expertise that effective monetary policymaking will require in the future.
Real change eventually will come.
But for now, in terms of both policy and personnel, it’s mostly old wine in familiar bottles.

Cory Aquino’s Legacy
MANILA – The death of President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino – "Tita Cory" to most of the 92 million people of the Philippines – left behind a precious inheritance: a legacy of freedom that the Philippines came to share with oppressed peoples around the world. For her revolution was the first of the wave of “velvet revolutions” that liberated countless millions from Manila to Seoul to Johannesburg to Prague, Warsaw and Moscow. President Aquino’s "People Power" revolution, indeed, is among the proudest moments in my country’s history, and the distinctive contribution of our people to the saga of mankind's long struggle for freedom and dignity.
Cory Aquino motivated ordinary Filipinos to peaks of daring and selflessness at a time when their spirit had almost been broken by a 14-year dictatorship. While her husband Ninoy Aquino lived, she – as the unassuming but caring housewife – was the stabilizing influence that tempered his dynamic personality. But after the assassination of Senator Ninoy Aquino in August 1983, she stepped resolutely into his role as political leader of my country’s democratic opposition to an entrenched despotic regime.
Devoid of histrionics, without pretension – "simply by telling people what the dictator has done to this country" – she touched the hearts of freedom-loving Filipinos everywhere, the pain of the traumatic murder by the regime of her husband evoking in them memories of their own suffering and thwarted hopes.
It was in her name that concerned Filipinos mobilized families and neighbors to confront the tanks, guns and barbed wire of the dictator's cohorts. And, in God's infinite wisdom, the militancy of common people burst forth in the non-violent revolution that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos.
We the soldiers and policemen who backed her were reinforced by Cory's steel core of values and principles.
In crisis after crisis during her presidency, she exemplified unwavering firmness in the democratic exercise of power as a servant-leader.
Cory provided policy guidance as Commander-in-Chief, but trusted the Defense Department and Armed Forces to carry out their missions in the face of 9 coup attempts which were all frustrated. These mutinies were all death-dealing situations that threatened national stability, and yet she never flinched.
Prayer and spiritual devotion were important components of Cory’s daily endeavors – and a major influence in her decision-making and personal relations. Her inner reserves of faith, indeed, kept her going through every hardship.
Her spiritual strength arose out of her deep and abiding reliance on the grace and boundless mercy of the god she believed in.
In the tumult of the post-revolutionary period, she presided with surprising even-handedness over the unavoidable rivalries among different sides of the political spectrum. More importantly, Cory sparked the momentum for the Philippines to regain a position of respect, dignity and even admiration in the community of nations.
So Cory Aquino's death has, in many ways, orphaned the Filipino nation. We who are left behind owe her the duty of safeguarding her legacy of freedom – and of enriching it with social justice and unity in nation-building. For until the very end of her battle with cancer, she continued to speak out for individual transformation and, on the part of those elected to lead us, for their selfless stewardship.
The finest tribute Filipinos and other freedom-loving peoples can offer to Cory's memory is for responsible citizens to work towards the vision of an empowered, bountiful future for which she and Ninoy aspired. Irrevocably, their names will forever be intimately intertwined with the peaceful revolution of 1986 which restored our liberty and democracy.
But the liberation she brought to us was just one battle in the generational struggle the people of the Philippines must wage to secure their liberation from poverty, inequity and injustice.
Success in that war is not pre-ordained, but can only be won through willing sacrifice, faithfulness to duty, and concerted action for our people's well-being.
These are the internal wars every nation and society, no matter how big or small, must win. Cory Aquino’s lifetime of service and sacrifice provided the tools and a model for how to win that seemingly eternal struggle. To sustain such a treasured legacy and defend democracy wherever it is threatened is our collective responsibility.

The Virus of Fear
NEW YORK – In September 1923, the Great Kanto earthquake devastated large parts of Tokyo, mostly owing to firestorms.
Rumors spread, and were often repeated in the mainstream press, accusing Koreans, a despised and poor minority, of planning to take advantage of the disaster by starting a violent rebellion.
Japanese vigilantes, armed with swords, bamboo spears, and even guns, then set upon anyone who sounded or looked Korean. Up to 6,000 people were murdered as police looked on and sometimes took part.
This was not some uniquely Japanese phenomenon.
Mobs massacring unpopular minorities remain all too common.
When Hindus started killing Muslims in Delhi recently, the Indian police were as passive, or as culpable, as the Japanese authorities were in 1923.
One need not go far back in European or American history to find similar, or even worse, cases of lynching and mass murder.
Irrational violence often arises from panic.
And panic can easily occur during a health crisis or in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
Lack of truthful public information can lead to conspiracy theories, which become lethal when politicians or the media deliberately stir them up.
In Japan in 1923, the Ministry of Home Affairs told policemen to watch out for Koreans who seemed to be looking for trouble.
In Delhi, a local politician of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Kapil Mishra, incited people to violence by promising to send in mobs to break up a peaceful Muslim protest if the police didn’t crack down hard first.
Could the current panic about the new coronavirus, COVID-19, have similar consequences?
Fortunately, there have been no massacres so far.
But the behavior of some politicians has been disturbing, to say the least.
In Italy, Matteo Salvini, the far-right opposition leader, said that migrants were a threat to the country as carriers of the virus, and criticized the government for rescuing a number of African refugees.
Right-wing nationalists in Greece are calling for concentration camps for refugees to protect the population from infection.
And then there is US President Donald Trump.
His main worry is that panic about COVID-19 will hurt the stock markets.
So, the first thing he did was to accuse his political opponents of “politicizing” the epidemic.
This clearly is not the best way to keep the public properly informed, and it provides a solid basis for conspiracy theories.
Trump’s son Donald, Jr. went further, and proclaimed that Democrats were hoping the disease would kill millions of people just to drag his father down.
Tom Cotton, a Republican US Senator from Arkansas and a possible future presidential candidate, repeated debunked speculation that the Chinese government had manufactured COVID-19 as a bioweapon.
Such absurdities are sometimes softened a little when they cause too much of a public outcry.
But the damage is already done.
A friend in New York observed last week how a large white male accosted two Asian-looking women, telling them he hoped the coronavirus would kill them, “just like we did to your people in Hiroshima.”
This man was clearly unhinged.
One would hope that most Americans, including most white male Americans, would be appalled by such behavior.
The problem is that when well-known senators and other high officials start peddling malicious conspiracy theories, unhinged people feel permitted to say and do things they might normally not.
It doesn’t take many unhinged people to form a violent mob.
This is why it is wrong to dismiss people who go on murder sprees in the name of a racial, political, or religious ideology as simply mad loners.
Figures like Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011 as part of his war to save the West from Marxists, multiculturalists, and Muslims, may indeed be lone operators.
But the people who spread conspiracy theories that inflame the minds of such killers bear at least some responsibility. The same goes for Muslim extremists who call for a holy war on wicked infidels, or politicians who claim that refugees carrying terrible diseases are threatening their countries.
COVID-19 is a threat, like all illnesses that can lead to pandemics.
And yet Trump tried to slash the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has not replaced the National Security Council teams responsible for pandemic response.
The president and his supporters don’t trust experts, and the man appointed to lead the fight against the coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence, is skeptical about science.
But science, not prayers, will be needed to contain a disease that threatens the globe.
Building big walls or pushing people into concentration camps, apart from being inhumane, are not effective remedies.
And using the crisis to incite hatred could have deadly consequences.
What is needed is expertise, international cooperation, and words from our political leaders that seek to calm fears.
Unfortunately, in too many parts of the world, we are seeing the exact opposite.

Diseases Without Borders
DAVOS – Today’s world seems more risk-laden than ever.
The increasingly visible effects of climate change, rising geopolitical tensions, state crisis and collapse, inadequate or unequal economic opportunities, and the spread of infectious diseases – to name just some of the highest-profile threats – have created an environment of great uncertainty.
Will 2015 be the year when these risks come to a head, or the moment when world leaders come together to develop real strategies for mitigating them?
This week, I am joining leaders from the worlds of business, government, politics, the arts, and academia at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the risks that the world faces.
Of course, determining which challenges merit the most attention will not be easy.
That is where the WEF’s annual Global Risks reports can help.
Drawing on the perspectives of roughly 900 experts and decision-makers from around the world who participate in the WEF’s global risks-perception survey, this year’s report found that, for the first time in its ten-year history, economic risks are taking a backseat to environmental and geopolitical concerns.
Specifically, participants rated interstate conflict with regional consequences as the top risk, in terms of likelihood, facing the world in 2015, with extreme weather events coming in second.
The top risks in terms of impact were water crises and the spread of infectious diseases.
The point, of course, is not simply to highlight how much danger the world currently faces.
By illuminating experts’ top-rated risks, the report highlights important opportunities for action.
According to WEF founder Klaus Schwab, 2015 can be a “year of destiny for humankind.”
Indeed, if global leaders – from multilateral organizations, governments, the private sector, and civil-society groups – seize opportunities for closer cooperation, long-simmering risks can be cooled before they boil over.
One area where concerted, collaborative action can make a major difference is the spread of infectious diseases.
During the meeting in Davos, officials will discuss the creation of a new global pandemic emergency facility that would enable countries to respond quickly to crises within their borders by providing them with the needed funds.
To understand how badly the world needs this capacity, one need look no further than the ongoing Ebola pandemic, which has ravaged West African societies, claiming thousands of lives and upending many more.
A rapid and determined response could have done much to contain the virus.
But the international response was delayed and inadequate.
Indeed, six months into the crisis, just 30 medical-response teams were treating and caring for patients on the ground in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
The shortage of health workers, facilities, and supplies prevented many people from receiving treatment, allowing the virus to spread further.
Fear of the disease’s seemingly inexorable spread hampered trade, business activity, and travel in the affected countries.
In December, the World Bank downgraded its growth estimates for the formerly fast-growing economies of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which are now expected to lose $1.6 billion in income in 2015.
In order to become better prepared to tackle future pandemics, the world must invest now in strengthening public-health systems, bolstering developing countries’ disease-prevention capacity, and establishing new and flexible financing instruments. A global pandemic emergency facility could mobilize public and private resources and frontload financing, so that when a global health emergency arises, funding is in place to support an immediate response at scale.
As the Ebola crisis has demonstrated, passing the hat once a pandemic has taken hold is far too time-consuming and carries huge economic and, more important, human costs.
Such a global resource could underpin the development of a comprehensive strategy to address the next outbreak, including a plan for putting health workers and supplies on the ground quickly.
It could even provide a market signal for producers of vaccines and drugs.
The WEF’s Global Risks report emphasizes the need for robust plans to face the threat of pandemics.
This is especially urgent in light of the rapid growth of cities and informal settlements – where infectious diseases can spread more easily – in developing countries.
We need to start creating those plans now.
After all, we do not know when the next pandemic will strike.
We cannot eliminate global risk.
We can, however, make our economies and societies more resilient and thus better equipped to minimize the impact of the threats we face.
In this sense, forward-thinking initiatives like the global pandemic emergency facility are crucial to making the world a safer place for all of us.

Balancing China’s High Savings
BEIJING – China’s national savings rate has been very high in recent years, amounting to 52% of GDP in 2008 (the most recent year for which statistics are available), and is often blamed for today’s global imbalances.
Countries that save too much export too much, according to conventional wisdom, resulting in high trade surpluses and growing foreign-exchange reserves.
But this is not always true.
For instance, if I save $100, but at the same time I invest $100 in my factories’ fixed assets, I am “balanced domestically” and not running an export surplus with anyone.
Such an example captures China’s recent economic situation. In late 2009 and in early 2010, China’s savings rate might well have remained at 50% of GDP had its trade surplus not narrowed significantly compared to previous years.
Indeed, China recorded a trade deficit in part of this period, as high investment in fixed assets (owing to government stimulus policies enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis) fueled domestic demand for goods in the same way that higher consumer spending would.
Only when a country invests less in fixed assets than the amount that it saves will the “surplus savings” show up in the trade balance.
The same logic can be applied to the US economy, but in the opposite way: even if the US wants to consume a lot and does not save, it may not run trade deficits if it does not invest much.
It runs a trade deficit only when it invests a lot while simultaneously not limiting consumption.
Savings are, of course, no bad thing.
If Americans and Europeans had saved more, they might not have created the global imbalances that fueled the financial crisis, or the worldwide sovereign-debt problems that have since emerged.
And savings are particularly good for developing countries.
One of the most daunting challenges for poor countries is the need to accumulate investment capital under conditions of low savings without incurring too much foreign debt.
Even for a developing economy with per capita income of $3,000, such as China, building wealth in the middle classes remains a central issue.
Spurring faster growth of small- and medium-size enterprises through relatively high investment in physical assets and R&D programs, improved infrastructure, and more rapid urbanization, all of which require a lot of savings to invest, is vital.
In any meaningful international comparison, China’s per capita stock of physical capital is still 8-10 times lower than in advanced countries like the United States and Japan.
Without relatively high savings, a developing country like China may never catch up.
If a developing country has high savings (despite efforts to increase current consumption) as a result of structural factors, the best strategy is not to reduce savings through short-run “external shocks,” such as dramatic exchange-rate appreciation, which may kill export industries overnight.
Rather, savings should be channeled even more – and more efficiently – to domestic investment in order to avoid large external imbalances.
For example, China should use its current high savings to build up the country’s infrastructure and speed up urbanization, thereby laying a firmer foundation for future development.
Savings could remain high, even as current consumption grows slowly, while the trade balance would be held in check by higher demand for imported capital goods.
Moreover, investment in public infrastructure and urban facilities will not create industrial “over-capacity”; instead, it will provide long-term public consumption durables that households and companies will use for years to come.
If China continues on this path, its external surplus will decrease further, other conditions being equal.
Of course, a country must deal with a savings rate that is “too high” even if it is not necessarily the main cause of external imbalances.
That is certainly the challenge for China in the long run.
A savings rate of 50% of GDP is too high under any circumstances, and household consumption equivalent to 35% of GDP is too low.
But this can and should be addressed by domestic policies aimed at bringing about structural change, not by external policies like exchange-rate appreciation.
Without domestic structural change, currency appreciation would not only undermine exports, but might also decrease imports, owing to higher unemployment and lower income.
China must recognize that high savings will not provide stable growth over the long run.
High domestic investment may for the time being prevent “surplus savings” from creating too much upward pressure on the external balance, but, given trends in China’s terms of trade, growth without an increase in domestic consumption is unsustainable over the long run.
High investment may cause economic overheating and increase the price of capital goods in the medium term, eventually triggering inflation.
So bringing the savings rate down is necessary if domestic and external balances are to be achieved.
Meanwhile, China’s so-called “export-oriented growth policy” itself may not be wrong for a developing country, because international trade in general creates more jobs and brings more income. But if exports continue to grow in the absence of consumption-led import growth, distortions occur and the trade surplus and foreign reserves increase.
China has adopted some policies to reduce its trade surplus, such as lowering import tariffs, withdrawing tax rebates for exported goods, and gradual exchange-rate appreciation.
But what China really needs is a greater effort to promote domestic consumption and lower the savings rate.

Female Genital Mutilation Mutilates Us All
On December 10th, women from around the world will gather at the European Parliament to fight against Female Genital Mutilation.
According to the World Health Organization, some 130 million women have, over the last few years, suffered from genital mutilation in some form.
In reality, those figures are probably even worse, because illegalities are almost always underestimated.
Female genital mutilation, according to the WHO, consists of the "removal of all or part of the external female genital organs."
It is a painful procedure carried out in unsafe ways by old women who are seeking to initiate girls into womanhood, and, more concretely, into a life that will be an unending chain of physical pain and social marginalization.
Indeed, genital mutilation makes a woman's experience of sex, that taboo of taboos, into a painful, humiliating, punitive procedure.
Over the last 80 years, women in democratic societies have struggled to be recognized and treated as citizens endowed with equal rights.
The right to own property, vote, work, divorce, the right to choose whether or not to have children have been secured only through political struggle.
All these civil victories for women contributed mightily to the advancement of social life and have been instrumental in initiating comprehensive social reforms that have transformed Western societies.
In these epochal battles, women's fiercest enemy has been tradition, and its staunch ally: religion.
With the help of information, education and mass participation, women and men, have defeated ignorance and the violence that goes with it hand-in-hand.
The fight against female genital mutilation is not a replay of the West's 'battle of the sexes' circa the 1960s; rather, it is a struggle against the fear of unknown enemies; against fear of change and the opportunities and contexts that arrive in the wake of change.
Throughout the world, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Arab peninsula, from certain regions of the Far East to expatriate communities in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, women are reacting against their being genitally, socially, civilly, and politically mutilated.
In other words, they react to their being considered and treated like some "unknown other."
Networks of local practitioners, non-governmental organizations and politicians are collaborating to confront the issue of female genital mutilation at a national level and to publicize it. There are ongoing efforts in Africa and elsewhere to internationalize a campaign that seeks to bring to galvanize public awareness of the dark fact that, in many countries, women remain mere commodities at the disposal of tradition.
Today, most of the African, Arab, and Asian countries blighted by the custom female genital mutilation are nonetheless signatories of the international conventions that condemn this practice, particularly the international Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the international Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Most of these countries also support a series of UN resolutions that call for eliminating female genital mutilation.
But all these commendable efforts have failed to counter the phenomenon.
So the issue is not good words and public promises, it is one of securing the political will necessary to stamp out the practice.
Female genital mutilation is a crime with real victims, but who are the criminals?
Should we incarcerate all women who carry out these mutilations on their fellow women?
Should we imprison mothers because they are willingly sacrifice their daughters' physical integrity on the altar of tradition?
Should we impose sanctions on countries that do not make the practice unlawful?
Should we patrol remote African villages with groups of human rights activists?
Tradition can only be countered by creativity.
We need to find ways to address the lack of a real freedom of expression for women in so many societies and, at the same, time to redress damage done to those victimized by female genital mutilation.
In doing so, we must be aware that the solution to genital mutilation of women cannot be limited to this issue alone. In fact, it needs to be part of a more comprehensive effort aiming at empowering and giving civil rights to women - 50% of the people that live in societies where the practice is carried out.
Such a concerted action must go beyond the sacrosanct effort of providing the old women who practice female genital mutilation with another job or in finding symbolic or ritualistic substitutes to the act of cutting off a woman's clitoris.
We need to reach into politics, because there will be no freedom for African, Arab, or Asian women without the advent of political democracy in their countries.
Here is the challenge that confronts those who live in countries where female genital mutilation is not routinely practiced but who care about the fate of women around the world.
Failure to recognize the political aspect of the issue will insure defeat and the continuance of a violent practice that abuses millions of women each year.
Over the last few years, I have had the chance to meet hundreds of individuals and groups in places where the practice exists.
Those people made the fight against female genital mutilation a priority in their lives.
Their courage, expertise, dedication and resolve is encouraging, but we must not leave them to fight their fight alone.
In Brussels on December 11th, eminent personalities from Africa and all over the world will launch an appeal open to signatures to internationalize their struggle. Those who want to join the Stop Female Genital Mutilation campaign carried out by AIDOS (Italian Association of Women for Development), TAMWA (Tanzania Media Women's Association), and No Peace Without Justice can sign the petition by visiting www.stopfgm.org .
In allowing so many lives to be blighted through genital mutilation, we degrade ourselves and our world.

Can Economics Shake Its Shibboleths?
LONDON – Though economics aspires to the rigor of the natural sciences, at the end of the day it is still a social science.
At no point in the past 40 years has this been more evident than it is now.
For decades, conventional macroeconomic analysis has rested on the edifice of the Phillips curve, which asserts a clear tradeoff between unemployment and inflation: when the unemployment rate falls below a certain point, inflation must rise.
But this assumption has not been borne out in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis.
In both the United Kingdom and the United States, for example, the unemployment rate is historically low, yet inflation remains weak.
Or consider monetary policy.
Even after years of quantitative easing (QE) and ultra-low interest rates, central bankers in the advanced economies – particularly the eurozone – have continued to undershoot their inflation targets.
Economists have also had to question long-held assumptions about downward nominal wage rigidity, an artifact of the 1960-70s, when organized labor was much stronger. Clearly, the idea that employees will always resist cutting wages (or workers’ hours) no longer applies.
In fact, the declining power of labor may explain why the Phillips curve no longer seems to hold true.
But, even more important, it could be the reason why measured productivity remains persistently weak.
After all, companies that can easily hire and fire employees or force them to adjust their price point have little reason to risk vast sums on new buildings and equipment that might not even be used until the next business cycle.
If this is the case, one solution to the productivity problem is simply to make labor markets less flexible and labor less cheap. If business leaders and economists object to that, perhaps they should stop prattling on about productivity all the time.
Another big theoretical assumption, particularly at the micro level, is that strong profit growth will attract new entrants to the market, thereby spreading profits more broadly at the expense of the previous incumbent.
And this, in turn, should encourage more investment, thereby boosting productivity and wages for workers.
But again, there is little evidence of this assumption being borne out in recent years.
To the contrary, corporate profits and market concentration are both on the rise.
What explains this conundrum?
It is not that Karl Marx was right all along that capitalism is doomed to fail.
Rather, it is the result of particular developments in financial markets, regulatory policies, and incentive systems in the era since the 2008 financial crisis.
Clearly, it has become far too easy for dominant market players to resist competition.
But there are many ideas floating around that might address that problem.
One issue that I have touched on before is stock buybacks, which may be allowing corporate executives to boost their own earnings without having to invest in productivity gains.
Fortunately, politicians of all stripes have begun to question why current tax and regulatory policies seem to be encouraging such behavior. As a general principle, companies that are not contributing to productivity growth or helping to solve broader social challenges shouldn’t be enjoying a free lunch.
The British construction company Persimmon, for example, has been posting higher earnings not because of investments it made, but because the UK government introduced a special loan scheme for first-time homebuyers.
And most of the major pharmaceutical firms now seem to show an interest in research and development only when they are buying a new drug and need to conduct clinical trials to secure exclusive rights to it.
Finally, at the global level, the biggest challenge to economic orthodoxy is the continuing growth of China since it launched its policy of economic “opening up” in the Deng Xiaoping era.
There is growing evidence to suggest that the US will do almost anything to stop China’s rise, even if it means denying prosperity to the Chinese people.
Those who have closely followed China’s development over the past 40 years know that a significant dose of capitalist ideology has seeped into the country’s nominally communist political economy.
But this fact seems to have eluded more ideologically predisposed Western economists.
Indeed, as Singaporean economist Kishore Mahbubani noted recently in The Straits Times, America’s hardline approach to the Chinese tech company Huawei appears to be driven wholly by ideology.
Rather than adopting a more measured strategy to ensure that the company (and others like it) abides by mutually agreed global rules, US President Donald Trump has made it a bargaining chip in his trade war.
If that is what the alternative to old orthodoxies look like, we should all be worried.

Can Russia be Saved?
MOSCOW – Russia’s economy is collapsing, but the situation could be even worse.
The global economic crisis has finally forced the government to adopt sensible policies, thereby staving off disaster – at least for now.
Official forecasts for Russian GDP growth in 2009 remain positive, but most analysts, including government officials, are bracing for a severe recession – which, indeed, appears to have started in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The stock market’s collapse – its 72% fall is the largest of all major emerging markets – is only the most visible sign of this.
Even Russia’s oligarchs are pawning their yachts and selling their private jets.
Signs of political instability are mounting.
The approval ratings for Russia’s president and prime minister are heading south.
Mass street protests have started – not led by opposition political parties but by workers and middle-class families facing job losses and declining wages.
More importantly, protesters are demanding that the government resign –unthinkable just a year ago.
With oil prices plummeting 70% from their peak (and similar price declines for metals, Russia’s other major export), it is no surprise that Russia is facing severe economic challenges.
Growth is endangered, the ruble is weak, and the government budget is in deficit.
Nevertheless, up to now, Russia’s government and private sector have weathered the storm reasonably well.
Critics of Vladimir Putin’s regime argue that Russia’s political system is too centralized and risks collapse in today’s economic storm.
The regime’s ideology, after all, places the state and loyalty to the rulers ahead of private property and merit.
When the crisis hits with full force, the government would nationalize major banks and companies, with the resulting inefficiency then burying the Russian economy, just as it doomed the Soviet Union.
Russia’s government has, in fact, made serious mistakes in dealing with the crisis.
Taxpayers’ money was spent to purchase corporate stocks in a failed attempt to support collapsing stock prices.
The government is unlikely to recover its investment anytime soon.
The government was also too slow in depreciating the ruble.
While one can argue that one-off devaluation was risky – as it could have triggered a panic – gradual depreciation should have started earlier than it did.
In the last two months of 2008, the central bank allowed the ruble to weaken at a rate of 1% per week, then at 2-3% per week.
It probably still needs to fall another 10%.
In the meantime, the central bank hemorrhaged reserves defending this slow correction, while commercial banks have been holding on to dollars in anticipation of the ruble’s further decline.
The third mistake was to raise import duties, especially for imported cars.
This was not only economically foolish (as with many other import-competing sectors, the automotive industry will certainly be protected by the weakening ruble), but also politically dangerous.
Car owners are an affluent, socially active, and easily organized group. Street protests against the import duties became the first serious popular uprising that Russia has seen in many years.
Yet these mistakes are relatively minor and reversible.
Indeed, Russia’s government, unexpectedly, has taken resolute and mostly correct economic decisions. First, it prevented the collapse of the banking system.
Many Russian banks were heavily exposed in foreign markets, and therefore faced severe financial problems once the crisis hit.
A massive liquidity injection by the government ensured that no major bank collapsed, and minor bank failures were administered in a surprisingly orderly fashion.
Moreover, the crisis has – so far – not resulted in major nationalizations of private companies.
The government could have used the crisis to nationalize all banks and companies in financial distress. It has not, despite its still awesome foreign reserves, which give it the wherewithal to buy out a significant portion of the economy at fire-sale prices.
Instead, up to now at least, the government has mostly been providing (high-interest) loans rather than engaging in massive equity buyouts.
Nor have the oligarchs been bailed out.
Of $50 billion in external debt owed by Russian banks and firms in 2008, the government refinanced only $10 billion.
Apparently, the terms offered by the government (LIBOR+5% and collateral) have turned out to be right on target.
How did reasonable economic policies prevail in this crisis?
The key factor is that, for the first time since Putin came to power, the Kremlin perceives a genuine threat.
The years of easy popularity are over.
All the ugly facts that Russians ignored during the years of fast economic growth are bubbling to the surface.
The regime knows that its survival depends on preventing economic collapse.
The crisis energized the system and shifted decision-making power to those who know about and can do something for the economy.
But did these policy changes come too late?
The ossified, corrupt, inefficient economy built in the fat years of the oil boom may be impossible to save.
So the central question that Russia confronts is whether even competent economic policy can prevent economic and political collapse.

A Child Killer Meets Its Match
SEATTLE – Like many others, I spent much of the last few years in isolation to avoid getting sick.
And now we are learning that this widespread disappearing act produced some unexpected side effects.
In particular, infections from once-common illnesses – like influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) – plummeted.
But now, as much of the world has returned to its normal pre-pandemic rhythms, that brief respite is over.
RSV, a dangerous infection that kills more than 100,000 young children each year, has returned with a vengeance.
Several countries, including South Africa and Australia, have recorded major RSV outbreaks, and hospitals in the United States are filled with babies who are struggling to breathe.
The alarming uptick in RSV cases bodes ill for the winter months in the northern hemisphere, especially with an expected bad flu season.
Yet while RSV can result in serious illness, like pneumonia, for very young children everywhere, it is rarely fatal in high-income countries like the US.
Over 97% of deaths due to RSV occur in low- and middle-income countries – a glaring disparity that has made the disease one of the leading killers of newborns and young children in these countries.
Fortunately, new technological developments on the horizon may soon mitigate the threat posed by RSV.
Promising advances in maternal immunization – vaccinating pregnant women to confer lifesaving protection on their babies – have the potential to save thousands of lives each year, and an effective RSV vaccine is finally in sight.
Maternal immunization has been safely and effectively used for decades to protect newborns from other infectious diseases, including whooping cough and tetanus.
If approved, this would be the first vaccine ever to protect children against RSV.
Although most RSV infections are mild, the virus can be much more severe in the youngest patients and can lead to pneumonia, which kills more children than any other infectious disease.
Moreover, there are no drugs to treat RSV.
For severe cases, medical oxygen is administered in a hospital to help babies breathe until the infection clears.
But that, of course, assumes that they can get to a hospital with oxygen.
For infants in parts of lower-income countries where hospital care or oxygen is out of reach, this common childhood illness can quickly become deadly.
It is in these settings that an RSV vaccine has the greatest potential to save lives and spare families from crushing grief.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has supported efforts to advance the field of maternal immunization for 15 years, funding research and development for maternal vaccines against influenza, whooping cough, other newborn bloodstream infections, and RSV and Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Our most recent investment in maternal RSV vaccines is focused on improving affordability and access for lower-income countries.
This is crucial for giving infants in these countries the best chance at life.
While the vaccine is still in development, I am hopeful that, if it is successful and gains regulatory approval, it will start to be rolled out – through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – in low- and middle-income countries as early as 2024.
Quick and equitable access to this lifesaving vaccine in countries where RSV remains a major killer will have a real impact on reducing childhood illness and death around the world.
Yes, a successful rollout also depends on whether a vaccine is acceptable and taken up by local communities.
But as matters stand, I am optimistic that it will be.
Research has shown that pregnant mothers are more likely to receive a vaccine to protect their babies before birth than they are to protect themselves.
Moreover, studies have found that if you can protect against RSV in the first few months of life, you can likely protect against other future respiratory infections, including pneumonia.
RSV is not a new problem.
Pediatricians and many parents have long dreaded this illness, and for good reason.
But we are on the cusp of finally developing and deploying the tools we need to protect infants when – and where – they are most vulnerable.
We should all continue working toward a future where children – regardless of where they are born – can grow up to live full, healthy lives, safe from the dangers of RSV and childhood pneumonia.
By ensuring equal access to these lifesaving vaccines, we can make that future a reality.

Europe's Dollar Envy
Currencies can become the focus not just for commercial transactions, but for diplomatic and political wrangles.
When this happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating.
But there have been more recent occurrences of nasty currency wars.
In the 1960's the international monetary order became the focus of a political tug-of-war. Each side had quite different theories and explanations of what was going on.
The Europeans--in particular the French--complained about what General Charles de Gaulle termed the "exorbitant privilege" of the US dollar.
The General and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, argued that the US used the dollar's status as the major reserve currency of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in order to run deficits and pay for its overseas military adventurism (at that time in Vietnam).
France responded with calls for monetary reform that would end the peculiar role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard.
Europeans began a long discussion of the advantages of monetary union, achievement of which would allow them to look the dollar in the face.
But from the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.
Other countries could change their exchange rates, and in this way could maintain greater export competitiveness.
The US government was powerless in the face of an undervalued yen, fueling the belief that the rest of the world was using the dollar to attack America's manufacturing base.
The Nixon administration came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism--a monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced into adjusting their exchange rates.
These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very immediate once again.
The world no longer has a fixed exchange-rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency--a sort of floating Bretton Woods. For Americans the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat, while for non-Americans it is yet another instance of an American neo-imperial quest for hegemony.
In this decade, China has taken the place of 1960's Japan, holding its exchange rate down in order to push export growth.
Consequently it is the target of US complaints about unfair competition, and of efforts to force an exchange-rate adjustment that would deter Americans from buying Chinese toys, appliances, and clothing. Manufacturers in the US have decided that Chinese-made bras constitute a threat to the American way of life.
Meanwhile, Europeans (especially the French) complain about the big US deficits, and de Gaulle's argument that the rest of the world is paying for America's wars is in fashion again.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater part of their reserves in euros, an echo of the General's unsuccessful attempt to force America to its knees by selling dollars for gold.
The 1960's ended in the breakdown of the "system," and in major financial turbulence, accompanied by an inflationary surge of commodity prices. Everyone was hurt, and America's role in world affairs was shaken.
A similar collapse now is likely to have a rather different effect.
The floating-rate system of today is stronger and the costs of adjustment differently distributed.
Most Americans do not suffer greatly from the dollar's sharp fall, as foreign sellers have to make price adjustments for the US market.
Asian economies are growing vigorously, and their central banks are building up claims on the US.
They are likely to continue this policy, as the alternative would be a sudden setback to the competitiveness of their export sectors in the all-important US market. This gives the US a longer time to address a current account deficit that is in the long run unsustainable.
The economically dynamic regions of the world--North America and Asia--are thus linked together in a pact that will ensure the continued centrality of the American dollar.
Americans will continue to pile up debt because Asians want them to do that.
To abrogate the pact would be against the interest of both parties.
This is not American unilateralism, because it means working with Asia.
But to Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism.
In the meantime, the rise of the euro against the dollar creates substantial European pain for manufacturing exporters.
Europe, however, is unable to do much to gain relief.
Indeed, Europe will be the major sufferer in the new currency clashes.
Answers that were touted in the 1960's--revival of the gold standard, or the invention of a common European currency--do not appear to be very helpful any more.
Having a single currency has turned out not to afford substantial protection.
The old version of the European response--what psychologists might call "dollar envy"--will only become more acute.
There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to expand the monetary base, as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all the industrial, structural, and demographic problems plaguing Europe.
But a moment's reflection should remind us that Europe's problems are not amenable to currency manipulation.
Protesting the new version of America's exorbitant monetary privilege should be seen for what it is: a way of compensating for a real European powerlessness.
So dollar envy is here to stay, and it will become even greater as the greenback's international value melts away without any obviously bad effects on the people who print and use it.

Sarkozy Agonistes
“Why do they hate us?” asked the Americans of the Islamic fundamentalists after 9/11.
“Why do they not like me?” could be the question asked by Nicolas Sarkozy to the French after more than one year in power.
Sarkozy is omnipresent both domestically and internationally.
On July 13, the leaders of more than 40 countries attended the first gathering of the “Union for the Mediterranean” in Paris.
France is back in the world and in Europe.
Domestically, an ambitious and difficult program of long-awaited reforms, which a majority of French citizens recognize are inevitable, has begun, with some early results in the field of labor law and education.
Sarkozy’s energy, willpower, and activism are nothing short of spectacular.
And yet he is the least popular of the Fifth Republic’s presidents, the one whose “fall from grace” with the French has been the most spectacular, rapid, and durable, to the point where political experts, and his friends and foes alike, wonder whether he can rebound.
What went wrong?
“I don’t want a good General, I want a lucky one” the French Emperor Napoleon I used to quip.
By that standard, he would not have wanted Sarkozy. Having campaigned on a promise to restore and improve the French people’s purchasing power, Sarkozy came to power, in May 2007, just a few weeks before the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted, and a few months before commodity prices exploded.
He then assumed the European Union presidency just days after the resounding Irish “No” to the Lisbon Treaty reduced his role to an exercise in damage control at best. And, to make matters worse, the French soccer team, whose World Cup victory in 1998 gave his predecessor Jacques Chirac a short respite and a passing popularity boom, was humiliated in June’s Euro championship.
Yet the international context, with its unforeseen events, does not suffice to explain Sarkozy’s unpopularity with the French.
His problem stems from the combination of his essence and style, which adds up to a brutal lack of coherence.
As economic crisis engulfs France and most of the world, the French are not reassured by their young and energetic president.
Of course, there is an element of deeply unfair subjectivity in this perception.
But this is what politics is all about.
The president’s physical appearance and his body language – if he was a Shakespeare character, he would probably be the traitor Iago in Othello – are part of the problem.
His nervousness, his impulsiveness verging on vulgarity, is disconcerting even for the majority of French who voted for him.
At home for example, the badly needed reform of the army has been accompanied by unnecessary malignity, as if a former interior minister imbued with a “police culture” was utterly incapable of understanding the “army culture” and its sense of honor.
And his undeniable success in implementing his labor laws, exemplified by sparse street demonstrations, has been undermined by his irrepressible will to provocation, reflected in his gratuitous remark that “today when there is a strike in France, no one notices it!”
In his foreign policy, too, Sarkozy seems to combine the right intuitions with the wrong tactics – that is, when his entire strategy is not marred by the pursuit of contradictory objectives.
France’s policy toward China and the issue of the French and EU president’s attendance at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics has represented a spectacular illustration of this lack of consistency.
Sarkozy misjudged the balance of power between France and China, and France came out of that diplomatic episode badly bruised, with its president swallowing his human rights claims and bending to the diktat of realpolitik.
In the same vein, there is a mismatch in Sarkozy’s approach to Europe between the message and the messenger, between careful diplomacy needed to create a new consensus within the European Commission and with countries like Ireland, and president’s rather authoritarian style.
While Sarkozy’s popularity remains low, a majority of the French want him to succeed, for he has four more years to go, and there is no alternative around the corner.
The left remains in disarray, caught between its internal feuds and the rise of anti-capitalist extremism at its margins.
For a president bent on implementing reforms, “less can be more” – less aggressiveness and less ego.
But can a man act against his deepest nature?
The answer is probably no.

South Korea’s Feminine Future
SEOUL – Over the last half-century, South Korea has made considerable economic progress, with per capita income increasing from a mere $80 dollars in 1960 to more than $22,000 last year. But its potential for sustained growth is faltering, owing to the imminent decline of its working-age population – projected to fall by 25% by 2050 – and rising competition from China and other emerging economies.
In order to improve its prospects, South Korea must pursue economic reform and restructuring, with an emphasis on maximizing its human-capital resources – especially women.
South Korea’s success over the last five decades owes much to the rapid growth of its well-educated labor force.
From 1960 to 2010, the share of adults with a secondary education soared from 20% to an impressive 87%.
By boosting productivity, increasing returns on investment, and facilitating technological adaption and innovation, South Korea’s abundance of well-educated workers has served as the foundation for its export-oriented development strategy.
But women remain underutilized, to the detriment of the entire economy.
Indeed, any effective South Korean growth strategy must create more and better economic opportunities for women, in part by establishing more accommodating working environments and instituting a more diverse and flexible education system.
To its credit, South Korea has built a relatively gender-equal society.
The gender gap in enrollment in both secondary and higher education is very small; and women’s access to elite positions in law, medicine, and the civil service has increased considerably in recent years.
The country elected its first female president, Park Geun-hye, in 2012.
But a significant gender gap remains in terms of the return on human capital.
According to OECD data, only 55% of South Korean women aged 15-64 are in the labor force, compared to an average of 65% in the advanced economies.
South Korea’s male labor-force participation rate, by contrast, stands at about 77% – close to the OECD average of 79%.
Women who have completed secondary or tertiary education are more likely to enter and remain in the labor market than their less educated counterparts.
The labor-participation rate for women with post-secondary education is 64%, far exceeding the 35% rate for those with only a primary or middle-school education.
But, even for South Korea’s most highly educated and capable female workers, child rearing is a major career obstacle. In fact, South Korean women participate in the labor force at roughly the average rate for the OECD while they are in their late twenties.
The problem is that the rate drops sharply from 71% to 57% among women in their 30’s, as inflexible working environments and a lack of affordable childcare undermine their ability to continue investing in their careers.
The good news is that Park’s government is working to change this.
Indeed, its three-year plan for economic innovation, announced in February, aims to raise the female employment rate to 62% by 2017, through the provision of affordable, high-quality childcare facilities and expanded paid parental leave, among other measures.
But it is less clear how the government will create additional jobs for women.
It could, for example, split full-time jobs into multiple part-time positions, and offer incentives for workers to reduce their hours.
But, given that South Korea’s workforce already includes a substantial share of non-regular workers, increasing temporary employment may not contribute to economic growth.
A better approach would entail creating high-quality jobs in modern service industries. As it stands, while the services sector accounts for more than 70% of employment in South Korea, its productivity-growth rate remains much lower than that of the manufacturing sector.
Too many people are working in traditional, low-productivity service industries, such as wholesale, retail trade, and restaurants, leaving modern, high-productivity services like communications, health, financial intermediation, and business services underdeveloped.
It is also important to narrow the mismatch between women’s abilities and their career paths.
The current system tends to reinforce gender roles, encouraging children to follow culturally framed paths, instead of nurturing their individual interests and potential.
For example, female university students are much more likely to study humanities than the so-called “STEM” subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) – key drivers of productivity gains, innovation, and economic growth.
Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors.
Of course, the potential of educated, empowered women to drive sustained economic growth is not limited to South Korea.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, too, has identified increased female labor-force participation as critical to efforts to revive his country’s long-dormant economy.
In South Korea, Japan, and elsewhere, developing and maximizing women’s potential will require comprehensive education and labor-market reforms, as well as structural change, particularly on the services side of the economy.
The question is whether political leaders are ready to back their lofty pronouncements with decisive action.

A G20 Refugee Agenda
DHAKA – Every day, an average of some 34,000 people are forced to flee natural or man-made disasters.
In the last six months alone, more than 2,000 lives have been lost in the Mediterranean; over the last weekend in June, 12,600 migrants arrived in Italy by sea.
Financial and political pressures are overwhelming the countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe that are on the receiving end of this human wave.
Unfortunately, in many cases, help is not on the way.
The scale of forced migration today has revealed troubling flaws in the organizations intended to serve as the last line of defense.
Weak mandates, insufficient funding, disorganized structures, and the absence of a global governance system have weakened intergovernmental agencies’ ability to act with authority in the name of the most vulnerable.
As I argue in Germany this week, G20 leaders meeting in Hamburg on July 7-8 have an opportunity to reshape the migration governance system with proactive protection policies that would enhance people’s trust in international leadership.
Although past summits have produced little more than talking points, the prospect for action is better this time, given that the talks will be held in Europe, where the impact of the migration crisis has been deeply felt.
At the moment, an alphabet soup of nonprofit and multilateral agencies tackles elements of the challenge.
These include independent groups like Refugees International (IR) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Even the World Trade Organization (WTO) plays a role in managing economic migration.
But at the intergovernmental level, the two most important players – the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) – are also under the greatest strain.
For the UNHCR, the challenges are systemic.
For starters, it lacks broad enforcement powers, and must rely on government cooperation, which is not always guaranteed in conflict zones – or forthcoming from neighboring states.
Countries that ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention have never fully adhered to it in practice, which limits the UNHCR’s ability to act. UNHCR interventions fail when countries are uncooperative, as we saw with Haitian and Cuban migrations to the United States in recent decades.
But the UNHCR also suffers from internal shortcomings.
Its communication with refugees on the ground is inconsistent.
While an increase in UNHCR protection officers would help, it is equally important that the agency get its facts straight.
For example, when host countries move to repatriate refugee populations forcibly, without informing the UNHCR, the agency itself looks unreliable, if not incompetent.
The UNHCR, as currently conceived is not the independent, nonpartisan agency it claims to be.
Heavily dependent on donors and host governments to launch relief operations, it is beholden to their interests and does not always have the political support it needs to get the job done.
The other major multilateral migration agency, the IOM, assists in the return of migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, and the internally displaced to their place of origin, or to other countries or regions that have agreed to accept them.
But, like the UNHCR, governance issues plague the IOM.
In particular, the IOM lacks a mechanism to evaluate whether national governments are using coercion – banned under international law – to repatriate or relocate refugees.
Nor does the IOM have the capacity to assess the safety of areas to which refugees are returning.
Millions of people benefit from IOM-sponsored programs and projects, but prior to joining the UN structure as a “related organization” in September 2016, the IOM had no formal mandate to protect the rights of migrants.
And even as a UN-related entity, the IOM suffers a mismatch between its broad mission and its meager budget and staff.
It has been held to a “zero growth” standard in recent years, even as demand for its programs has increased. And, because its work is largely project-based, with member states funding specific activities, its role in mitigating refugee crises is largely reliant on individual members’ preferences and priorities.
As key guardians of the world’s refugees, these two organizations must adapt to today’s challenges. Proactive policies on interagency coordination and financial burden sharing are essential.
Elements of the Refugee Convention, like language on asylum policies, also should be updated to reflect current realities, and both agencies need to develop holistic and consistent policies on refugee advocacy and protection.
To this end, the member states of both organizations should support their continued integration within the UN structure, which would give them more tools to influence the causes, not just the effects, of forced displacement.
These are just a few of the governance upgrades that I have recommended for the G20.
Both the UNHCR and the IOM could benefit from stronger multilateral support, and the G20 is uniquely poised to offer it.
If we cannot end war, famine, corruption, or poverty, then the next best solution is to improve the organizations helping those who flee them.

A Golden Opportunity
CAMBRIDGE: The rich countries meeting in June at the G-7 Economic Summit in Cologne had some interesting things to declare about their relations with the poor countries. First, they acknowledged -- without ever quite admitting it -- that their earlier attempts to reduce developing-country debt had failed.
Therefore they signaled the start of a new program, immediately dubbed the Cologne Initiative, to reduce further the debt burden of the so-called Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs).
Second, they instructed the IMF and the World Bank to re-think their development strategies, in order to put more focus on social problems, particularly health and education.
One could of course be quite cynical about both announcements.
After all, it has been clear to most objective observers for many years that the rich countries had no realistic strategy for reducing the unpayable debts of the poor countries, yet such critics were told to be patient, that everything was okay.
Moreover, only the finance ministers of the G-7 could possibly have believed that the IMF and World Bank were doing a good job in the poorest countries.
In truth, their record is often disastrous, or simply irrelevant. The IMF in particular doesn't have a strategy for long-term economic development, even though the United States has assigned the IMF the lead role in economic development in dozens of poor countries.
Another reason for cynicism is that the G-7 didn't move mainly on their own initiative, but rather in response to a growing cry of international civil society for action on behalf of the world's poorest.
The credit for the Cologne Initiative goes strongly to the worldwide movement known as Jubilee 2000, a grass-roots movement based on the biblical concept of Jubilee, in which unpayable debts should be forgiven in order to allow a debtor to have a fresh start in life. The Jubilee 2000 movement has adherents in all parts of the world, including Pope John Paul II, rock stars such as Bono of the Irish group U2, and non-governmental organizations representing many religions and professions.
We should move beyond cynicism, however, in embracing the new Cologne Initiative, especially to push the G-7 countries to do all that needs to be done to make the Initiative successful.
The details of the Initiative announced in Cologne were disappointing, but these details can still be changed under international public pressure.
At least the Initiative pointed in the right direction.
The motivation for urgent action on behalf of the poorest nations is clear.
The 42 countries that are part of the HIPC initiative have a combined population of around 700 million.
Around three-fourths of these people live in Africa.
The combined HIPC population has a life expectancy of around 50 years, compared with 78 years in the rich countries.
Around one-third of the children are malnourished, and will consequently suffer a lifetime of physical and cognitive disabilities.
Many will never finish even primary school, or be able to play an effective role in modern society.
Diseases are rampant, including an AIDs epidemic that killed around 2 million people in Africa last year, and malaria, which took more than 1 million lives.
A successful Cologne Initiative would build on the following concepts.
First, the debts of the countries suffering from extreme poverty and illness would be forgiven entirely.
Around 25 countries out of the 42 HIPC countries probably need complete debt cancellation.
Second, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank, rather than the International Monetary Fund, should take the lead in helping these countries. Both the UNDP and the World Bank would help to ensure that debt forgiveness opens the way to new and ambitious programs of social improvement -- with the focuses on health and education.
The UNDP should turn its annual Human Development Reports into concrete guidelines for social action, to help ensure that each impoverished country has the adequate resources to provide effective programs for children's vaccines, AIDS prevention, meals for impoverished children, improved access to clean water, and mother-and-infant medical care. The UNDP should also have the task of coordinating the specialized agencies of the United Nations on behalf of the world's poorest, to ensure that key organizations such as United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have the access and financial resources to fulfill their missions.
The Cologne Summit announcements so far fall short of these objectives.
The debt relief proposals are still too small.
The role of the IMF remains too large.
Public health goals are still too far down the list of priorities.
But we should maintain hope and pressure on the international organizations and the rich countries.
Already, international actions have pushed the G-7 in a new and hopeful direction.
With a continued worldwide movement on behalf of global justice and economic development, a much more ambitious program for the world's poorest can still be reached.

A Private-Sector Solution to the Refugee Crisis
BRUSSELS – International development is not just about alleviating poverty; it is also about delivering security, stability, and economic opportunities to poor and fragile communities, thereby preventing citizens from having to flee their home country in search of a better life.
For a West eager to stem the flows of refugees and migrants from Africa and the Middle East, supporting development is a much more effective approach than building walls and razor wire fences.
But too often development is forced to take a back seat in policymaking.
The so-called War on Terror that began in 2001 has evolved into multiple brutal conflicts that are destabilizing the entire Middle East, eroding people’s freedoms, undermining their safety, and transforming the very nature of their societies.
This is driving people from their homes, and often from their countries.
The ongoing conflict in Syria, in particular, has already displaced some five million people.
It is, of course, sensible to say that refugees should stay in the first safe country they can reach.
But many, nonetheless, clamor to escape the instability of their region altogether.
They dream of a life of security and opportunity in Europe, and are willing to go to great lengths to obtain it – even embarking on a life-threatening journey across the Mediterranean Sea.
For Europe, turning our backs on these refugees is not an option – desperate people will continue to march toward safety and hope – though many continue to believe that it is.
When German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed to accept a million refugees into Germany, she was praised by many – and opposed by many others.
But simply absorbing the refugee flows is not really an option either, at least not a complete one.
What if Egypt were to explode in the way that Syria has?
Developed countries – some of which have resisted accepting any refugees at all – would not simply accept 20 million newly displaced people.
The only real option for tackling the refugee crisis is to address the causes of people’s displacement, including terrorism, hunger, disease, oppression, inadequate infrastructure, scarce vital resources, a lack of jobs and economic prospects, and falling standards of living.
Seen in this light, supporting international development is not some discretionary act of generosity; it is a matter of mutual survival.
To succeed, however, requires adapting development policies to economic reality.
Rather than simply handing money from one state to another, as the world has done for the last 60 years, development funds must be used to mobilize the private sector – the real engine of economic growth and development.
Indeed, in developing economies, the private sector accounts for 90% of jobs.
With the right approach, the €20 billion ($21.9 billion) in annual development funding provided by the European Union could be leveraged to mobilize €300 billion of capital for the developing world, changing millions of people’s lives for the better. The model is straightforward: first, blend public, private, and charitable contributions; second, invest the funds under rigorous private-sector standards, rather than entrusting them to profligate public-sector actors who often treat donor money with contempt.
Such blended finance vehicles, though in their infancy, have already been shown to work well elsewhere in the world.
A World Economic Forum survey found that every $1 of public money invested in such initiatives attracted as much as $20 of private investment.
And this does not even account for the benefits implied by improved accounting, tendering, and reporting procedures – all by-products of greater private-sector involvement.
This approach is especially appropriate at a time when many European countries are struggling with sluggish growth and face tight fiscal constraints.
Only four EU members now spend the globally agreed 0.7% of gross national income on development aid.
The good news is that European governments increasingly seem to recognize the need to tap the potential of the private sector to support development.
Last month, at a European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, the European Commission threw its support behind my plan to put the private sector front and center in development projects.
But establishing private-sector investment as a key component of Europe’s development strategy is just the first step.
The Commission must now put words into action, which means engaging directly with the private sector and business communities.
By stabilizing Middle Eastern societies and advancing their economic development, Europe can help to stem the influx of migrants and asylum-seekers today, while securing new markets, business opportunities, and partnerships tomorrow.

Migration Fact vs. Migration Fiction
LONDON – Migration continues to dominate political debate in many countries.
Rightly so: the issue affects economies and societies worldwide.
But public opinion on this crucial topic tends to be shaped by emotions, rather than facts.
The result is a lack of open and effective dialogue about migration’s risks – or its many benefits.
Populist leaders, in particular, have been eager to manipulate the migration debate, using inflated figures and other gross exaggerations to stoke popular fears.
Such incendiary rhetoric directly hurts immigrants, even those who have long lived in their new country.
In the United Kingdom, reported hate crimes against immigrants surged 42% year on year in the run-up to and aftermath of June’s Brexit referendum.
But the impact of anti-immigrant sentiment extends far beyond national borders.
If populist fear-mongering drives their countries to embrace exclusionary, protectionist policies, the effect on the global economy – and the livelihoods of millions of people around the world – would be disastrous.
It is now up to rational political leaders and mass media to reintroduce facts into the debate.
They must publicize the actual figures for migration flows, both into and out of their countries.
They must make clear to citizens that many of the problems for which immigrants are blamed are not actually their fault.
And they must highlight immigrants’ large social and economic contributions.
The Brexit vote was driven by a distorted picture – eagerly painted by tabloid newspapers and populist politicians – of a country overflowing with migrants.
And, in fact, surveys show that in most countries, residents greatly overestimate the number of migrants in their midst.
In some Eastern European countries, Muslim migrants are perceived as being up to 70 times more numerous than they are.
The truth is that the share of people living outside their countries of origin has barely increased in recent decades, standing around 3% of the nearly 7.5 billion people alive today.
In the last five years, 36.5 million people – just 0.5% of the global population – have left their native lands.
It is a myth that all developing-country citizens seek to reach wealthy Western societies.
Those who do migrate are far more likely to stay in their own region.
Less than 1% of Africans have relocated to Europe.
Meanwhile, plenty of advanced-country citizens – including 4.9 million UK nationals – are represented in global migration figures.
Claims that migrants are a drain on national budgets are similarly inaccurate.
In the UK, immigrants generate more in taxes than they draw in benefits.
In fact, many advanced countries need migrants.
Of the ten countries with the highest share of people over the age of 65, nine are in Europe.
While industrialized countries often suffer a shortage of low-skill workers – Hungary recently acknowledged that it needs 250,000 foreign workers to fill the gaps in its labor market – immigrants are not necessarily uneducated.
In 2010, 29% of immigrants to the OECD had university degrees.
Beyond contributing to host economies as workers, entrepreneurs, investors, and taxpayers, migrants (and refugees) support development in their countries of origin through remittances.
Indeed, remittances account for a significant share of GDP in many developing countries, and are often the largest source of foreign-currency earnings. Not only do remittances help pay for critical imports; by improving the balance of payments, they allow countries to borrow at lower interest rates in private capital markets.
Of course, there are challenges associated with migration.
But they can be overcome.
The refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, which has spurred panic across Europe, could have been addressed effectively with coordinated international action, as occurred in the past.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the international community rallied to resettle more than a million Vietnamese.
In the 1990s, when the Balkan conflicts displaced almost four million people, Europe stood up and helped.
But the political atmosphere today is less welcoming.
Donald Trump, the Republican US presidential nominee, portrays Syrian refugees fleeing for their lives as a security threat, despite the thorough screening procedures implemented by the current administration, which has committed to taking 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the fiscal year.
Hungary is set to hold a referendum in October on EU refugee quotas.
As advanced countries fight to keep out asylum-seekers – in Hungary’s case, just a few thousand – developing countries are housing millions of them.
Five countries that together constitute less than 2% of global GDP – Turkey, Jordan, Pakistan, Lebanon, and South Africa – provide shelter to almost half of the world’s refugees.
The world’s six wealthiest countries – the US, China, Japan, Germany, France, and the UK – account for 60% of global GDP, but they hosted fewer than 9% of all refugees last year.
This is no accident.
From 2010 to 2014, European states spent more than €1 billion ($1.1 billion) on walls and borders.
These attempts to “regain control” by erecting new barriers force migrants into the hands of exploitative smugglers and undermine trade and cooperation.
As it stands, only 7,200 of the 22,504 non-European refugees that the EU pledged last year to resettle have arrived.
Thousands of unaccompanied children, the most vulnerable of migrants, have yet to find a place.
Beyond the legal obligations of all signatories of the 1951 Refugee Convention, this is a test of humane values and decency – one that the so-called advanced countries are largely failing.
It is time for these countries to recognize that the best way to ensure orderly migration is to open legal channels for refugees and migrants.
As for integration, some of the practical hurdles can be overcome through more local investment and more coherent policies across government departments.
People have always moved, either by choice or when forced by circumstances.
This will not change.
It is time to stop resisting it and, armed with facts, start managing it.

The Resource Revolution
SAN FRANCISCO – The world is on the threshold of the biggest business opportunity in a century, rivaling both the first Industrial Revolution, which transformed labor productivity, and the second,which mobilized unprecedented amounts of capital to build cities.
The new revolution centers on the third primary factor of production: natural resources.
The revolution arrives not a moment too soon.
After centuries of wasteful production and consumption practices – facilitated by ever-lower commodity prices that have declined by an average of 0.7% a year in peacetime over the past century – the world is in dire need of technologies that enable producers and consumers alike to do more with less.
Making matters more urgent, resource extraction is becoming increasingly expensive, as production shifts to locations that present difficult logistical – and often political – challenges.
Meanwhile, levels of air, water, and soil pollution are rising rapidly in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, and other emerging economies.
In order to achieve their growth objectives, companies must fundamentally rethink the way they integrate technology and use natural resources in their productive processes. Over the last two decades, companies have had to improve their performance by only 1-2% annually to achieve an increase in profits, and many have focused almost exclusively on capital and labor productivity.
As a result, even the most successful managers lack the skills to cope with today’s resource-constrained markets.
In this environment, companies cannot compete on the basis of twentieth-century (if not nineteenth-century) technologies and practices.
There is much more value in pioneering new, higher-productivity business models, based on five key changes:
• Substituting costly, toxic, or scarce materials with cheaper, more efficient, higher-performance, and more abundant alternatives.
• Embedding software in resource-intensive industries to optimize their production processes or products.
• “Virtualizing” processes – that is, moving them out of the physical world.
• Embracing circularity, which entails finding value in products after their initial use.
• Eliminating waste.
The good news is that progress is already being made.
America’s burgeoning shale oil and gas industry, for example, has transformed its entire energy sector by revolutionizing resource extraction. Today, drilling is not only a dirty process characterized by heavy equipment, toxic mud, and sulfurous fumes.
With the integration of information technology and hydraulic-fracturing (“fracking”), the central players are experts using joysticks and high-resolution screens to maneuver drill bits through geological formations.
Individual companies have pioneered change in other sectors.
Cree and Philips have developed LED lighting technologies that offer 23 times longer life, measurably better color, easier control, and 85% lower operating costs than traditional incandescent bulbs.
Similarly, OPower has used behavioral science and cloud-based software to motivate consumers to cut their energy consumption by 2-4% annually – a change that is beginning to reshape power markets.
And DIRTT (Doing it Right This Time) is building office interiors at as little as half the traditional cost through software-enabled virtualization, waste elimination, and optimization of the construction process.
These innovations exemplify the massive potential for businesses to improve resource productivity.
Indeed, using tools provided by information technology, biology, and nanotechnology, the world can triple growth in resource productivity, raising it to 3 to 5% annually over the next two decades.
But this cannot occur without strong and forward-thinking leadership, which, unfortunately, is sorely lacking in today’s business environment.
Indeed, managers today seem consistently surprised by the pace of change and thus find themselves behind the curve.
For example, many automobile manufacturers ignored the shift toward electric and hybrid vehicles – though sales were increasing at a rate of more than 50% annually – until their sales of conventional cars plummeted in key markets.
Likewise, many are shocked that the cost of solar power is increasingly undercutting that of nuclear, coal, and gas technologies, even though this shift is in line with a trend that began in 1970.
Companies should devote more attention to developments in related industries as well.
Automakers must monitor the consumer electronics industry to track advances in battery technology.
And power companies need to analyze the development of semiconductors to anticipate the likely drop in demand for electricity, after more than a century of growth.
To win in the resource revolution, companies must balance technological, physical, and human-capital inputs, while adopting a more intelligent approach to organizational design and talent management. Whether the primary imperative is spotlighting data and analytics or forming new partnerships in other sectors to gain access to specialized expertise, aggressive innovation, and ambitious efficiency goals are critical.
Forward-thinking entrepreneurs are already reaping the benefits of this fast-moving revolution.
Those who fail to adapt will fail to survive – and soon.

The Euro at Mid-Crisis
CAMBRIDGE – Now that the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have committed €67.5 billion to rescue Ireland’s troubled banks, is the eurozone’s debt crisis finally nearing a conclusion?
Unfortunately, no.
In fact, we are probably only at the mid-point of the crisis.
To be sure, a huge, sustained burst of growth could still cure all of Europe’s debt problems – as it would anyone’s.
But that halcyon scenario looks increasingly improbable.
The endgame is far more likely to entail a wave of debt write-downs, similar to the one that finally wound up the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980’s.
For starters, there are more bailouts to come, with Portugal at the top of the list.
With an average growth rate of less than 1% over the past decade, and arguably the most sclerotic labor market in Europe, it is hard to see how Portugal can grow out of its massive debt burden.
This burden includes both public debt (owed by the government) and external dent (owed by the country as a whole to foreigners).
The Portuguese rightly argue that their situation is not as dire as that of Greece, which is already in the economic equivalent of intensive care.
But Portugal’s debt levels are still highly problematic by historical benchmarks (based on my research with Carmen Reinhart).
With a baseline scenario of recession or sluggish growth amid budget austerity for years ahead, Portugal will likely seek help sooner rather than later.
Spain is a more difficult case.
The central government is arguably solvent, but a significant chunk of municipal and provincial bank debt seems underwater.
The big question in Spain is whether, as in Ireland, the central government will allow itself to be gamed into taking on private (and also municipal) debt.
Here again, history gives no cause for optimism.
It is very difficult for a central government to sit on the sidelines when the economy’s key players are on the brink of collapse.
But bailouts for Portugal and Spain are only the next – and not necessarily final – phase of the crisis.
Ultimately, a significant restructuring of private and/or public debt is likely to be needed in all of the debt-distressed eurozone countries.
After all, bailouts from the EU and the IMF are only a temporizing measure: even sweetheart loans, after all, eventually must be repaid.
Already facing sluggish growth before fiscal austerity set in, the so-called “PIGS” (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) face the prospect of a “lost decade” much as Latin America experienced in the 1980’s. Latin America’s rebirth and modern growth dynamic really only began to unfold after the 1987 “Brady plan” orchestrated massive debt write-downs across the region.
Surely, a similar restructuring is the most plausible scenario in Europe as well.
It sometimes seems that the only eurozone leader who is willing to face the likely prospect of future debt restructuring is German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The Germans have been widely castigated for pointing out that Europe has no clear mechanism for sorting out sovereign (government) defaults, and that surely it needs one.
Many pundits would have one believe that Ireland would have pulled through unscathed absent Germany’s blundering statements.
That is nonsense.
With huge private debts, falling house prices, and external claims on Ireland amounting to more than 10 times national income (according to the Reinhart-Rogoff database), there was never going to be an easy way out.
Allowing European debt problems to fester and grow by sweeping them under the carpet through dubious theatrics can only make those problems worse.
Indeed, only last July the eurozone made a big show of its financial “stress tests” of its banks, giving almost all of them, including in Ireland, a clean bill of health.
Denial is a not a useful policy for dealing with a financial crisis.
Europe’s debt problems should, in fact, still be quite manageable – provided the requisite write-downs and debt restructurings are implemented.
Here is where the latest Irish bailout is particularly disconcerting.
What Europe and the IMF have essentially done is to convert a private-debt problem into a sovereign-debt problem.
Private bondholders, people and entities who lent money to banks, are being allowed to pull out their money en masse and have it replaced by public debt.
Have the Europeans decided that sovereign default is easier, or are they just dreaming that it won’t happen?
By nationalizing private debts, Europe is following the path of the 1980’s debt crisis in Latin America.
There, too, governments widely “guaranteed” private-sector debt, and then proceeded to default on it.
Finally, under the 1987 Brady plan, debts were written down by roughly 30%, four years after the crisis hit full throttle.
Most post-mortems of the Latin American crisis suggest that all parties would have been far better served had they been able to agree on partial debt forgiveness much earlier.
Latin America might have returned to growth far sooner than it did.
Creditors might even have received more in the end.
As European policymakers seek to move from one stage of denial to another, perhaps it is time to start looking ahead more realistically.
As any recovering alcoholic could tell them, the first step is admitting, with Merkel, that Europe has a problem.

Norway's Sovereign Duty
BRUSSELS – Recent developments in Norway could have momentous implications for climate-related commitments at the UN climate-change conference (COP26) in Glasgow this November.
In August, a government-appointed committee recommended that Norway put its sovereign wealth fund (SWF) on track for net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and that the fund’s activities be made consistent with Norway’s commitments under international climate agreements.
Soon thereafter, the Norwegian Labour Party’s candidate for prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, confirmed that, if elected, he would introduce a net-zero target for the fund. Now that Støre has emerged victorious in this month’s parliamentary elections, his challenge is to form a coalition that will allow him to follow through on his conviction.
Norway’s $1.4 trillion Government Pension Fund Global is the world’s largest SWF.
But the country has been hesitant to put the weight of its fund behind its own international climate commitments.
It is not alone.
Under existing international agreements, climate commitments are based on emissions originating within each country’s physical borders.
Emissions resulting from countries’ foreign asset holdings are not counted in the domestic inventory.
Thus, while governments have scrutinized their economies for emissions cuts, they have tended to leave their countries’ SWFs on the sideline.
As a result, only one sovereign fund, Germany’s KENFO, has signed on to the United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which represents some $6.7 trillion in assets under management, and counts 46 pension funds and insurance companies among its members.
Given that Norway’s massive SWF owns 1.4% of all the world’s listed companies, on average, the country’s apparent change of heart is important both symbolically and as a practical matter.
The new Norwegian government is backed up by the recent recommendation from Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and others recommending it to sign up its SWF for the Net-Zero Alliance at COP26.
But Norway should not stop there.
All told, sovereign funds represent some $10 trillion in assets under management, or about seven times that of Norway’s SWF alone.
As the country with the world’s largest SWF, Norway should spearhead a diplomatic effort for a global movement of sovereign funds toward net-zero commitments at COP26.
Norway has a proud history of activist international diplomacy.
Its highly capable foreign service has played a central role in mediating an end to armed conflicts around the world. Moreover, its sovereign-fund manager, Norges Bank Investment Management, is a sophisticated and globally respected investor.
Together, these attributes place Norway in a strong position to mobilize others within a sovereign-fund coalition toward net-zero targets.
Fortunately, some SWFs have already demonstrated burgeoning climate ambitions. Norway can look to countries like France, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates for potential partners.
These countries’ sovereign funds have sophisticated investment teams that would be perfectly capable of implementing net-zero targets.
And one hopes that when they do, SWFs at an earlier stage of their climate commitments, or that have more limited resources, will join the new global consensus.
As the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reminds us, the window for averting catastrophic climate change is closing quickly.
And yet, many countries remain unable or unwilling to make the necessary emissions cuts within their own borders.
Under these fraught conditions, governments with large foreign asset holdings should look for ways to mitigate climate change not only within their borders but across all assets that they own and are able to influence. For Norway and several Gulf countries whose SWFs’ asset holdings amount to multiples of their domestic economy’s GDP, the largest potential climate gains can be found in SWF portfolios.
Countries with SWFs should recognize that accounting for climate risk and climate-related investment opportunities is no longer sufficient.
In fact, countries doing only that with their SWFs are essentially taking advantage of the climate crisis without doing anything to prevent it.
Norway, a star of international peace negotiations, should seize the opportunity to lead a global sovereign-fund movement.
Doing so would establish it as a champion of international climate diplomacy and leadership.
For a country that built its wealth by pumping hydrocarbons out of the seabed and exporting them along with their inherent GHG emissions, it is the right thing to do.

The Passing of Russia's First Dissident Generation
NEW YORK – In November 1988, when the great Russian physicist and Nobel Peace laureate Andrei Sakharov made his only visit to the United States, he asked a few of his fellow human-rights activists to accompany him.
One of them was the biologist Sergei Adamovich Kovalev, who died on August 9 at the age of 91.
Sakharov’s visit was a notable occasion.
He had been restricted to living in the provincial city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod) until December 1986, when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, signaling an easing of state repression, telephoned him to let him know he could return to Moscow.
Many scientific groups, human-rights organizations, and others organized meetings with Sakharov during his visit to the US.
I attended a number of these as the executive director of Human Rights Watch.
I can still recall that while Sakharov was asked many questions, he generally responded with something like: “Before I comment, I would like to hear Sergei Adamovich’s views on that.”
This was the great physicist’s way of showing respect for the man who, though some ten years younger, had mentored him in the field of human rights.
I also think it was a way to pay tribute to a colleague who had suffered much more from Soviet repression.
Whereas Sakharov had spent seven years in internal exile in Gorky, Kovalev had spent seven years in prison, followed by three years of internal exile.
Until his death, Kovalev was the last surviving leader of a Soviet human-rights movement that astonished the world, starting in the 1960s.
These dissidents spoke out in the heart of a totalitarian empire that stretched across Eurasia.
Already in the 1950s, Kovalev had drawn on his scientific training to challenge the doctrines of Stalin’s favorite scientist, T.D. Lysenko, including by co-authoring the first article published in the Soviet Union criticizing Lysenko’s bizarre theory of genetics.
In 1965, Kovalev participated in the first organized protest against human-rights abuses in the USSR, following the arrests of Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky, two writers who had published abroad under pseudonyms.
Then, in 1969, Kovalev founded the USSR’s first human-rights organization, the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights.
Much of Kovalev’s human-rights advocacy involved the Chronicle of Current Events, which became the leading source of information on human-rights developments in the Soviet Union.
The journal embodied the approach of the “legalists,” a key segment of the emerging human-rights movement at the time.
Because lawyers in the USSR tended to be bureaucrats administering state policies, few of them worked on human rights.
Hence, many of the legalists – from Kovalev to the physicists Valery Chalidze and Yuri Orlov – were scientists who examined whether provisions of Soviet law complied with the international law to which the USSR was ostensibly committed, and whether these provisions were being upheld.
For example, they pointed out that the Soviet Constitution’s provision guaranteeing open trials was regularly ignored in practice.
Kovalev’s work through the Initiative Group and the Chronicle led to his arrest in December 1974, followed by his conviction on charges of engaging in anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.
The Soviet authorities found a rationale for holding his trial in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, thereby excluding foreign journalists whose press credentials were limited to Moscow.
For his part, Sakharov traveled to Lithuania in an attempt to attend the trial, but he was barred from the courtroom.
(Coincidentally, while he was there, his wife, Yelena Bonner, was in Oslo receiving the Nobel Peace Prize on his behalf.)
Kovalev would go on to serve most of his seven-year prison sentence at the notorious Perm-36 forced labor camp in the Ural Mountains, and his three years of internal exile in Siberia.
When I saw him not long after the completion of his sentence, he was haggard and emaciated.
In 1990, the Soviet Union’s last full year, Kovalev was elected to the Congress of People’s Deputies and chosen (with support from Boris Yeltsin) as the chair of its Human Rights Committee. He made it clear that his focus would be on protecting civil, political, and individual rights, rather than the economic, social, and collective rights that the Soviet Union claimed to champion.
He made penal reform a major concern, elevated issues such as migrant and refugee rights, and led efforts to abolish Russia’s “propiska” system, which restricted citizens’ ability to choose their place of residence.
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the shelling of the (Russian) White House in October 1993, and the adoption by referendum of a new constitution two months later, Kovalev was appointed chair of a new Russian Human Rights Commission.
And not long thereafter, the Yeltsin government launched the First Chechen War to crush a breakaway Chechen independence movement led by a former Soviet Air Force general, Dzhokhar Dudayev.
Though he was a commissioner of the Russian government, Kovalev became the most outspoken critic of the war.
To demonstrate against the bombing of the Chechen capital, Grozny, and to publicize the risks the city’s civilian population faced, he moved there.
He also personally conducted investigations into the treatment of Chechen prisoners and issued detailed reports on his findings.
Members of the Russian Parliament soon labeled him an enemy of Russia and dismissed him from his post.
In subsequent years, Kovalev was harshly critical of human-rights abuses under Yeltsin.
And when Yeltsin was succeeded by Vladimir Putin, he became even more outspoken in criticizing the new Russian leader’s monopolization of power and denial of civil and political rights.
In a November 2007 essay in the New York Review of Books, Kovalev wrote: “I believe that Vladimir Putin is the most sinister figure in contemporary Russian history.”
In his later years, Kovalev resumed his earlier activism through his work with Memorial, a leading Russian human-rights organization that he helped found.
He remained deeply disappointed by Russia’s reversion to the same kind of despotism he had done so much to help overturn in the previous century.
But he continued, until the end, to hope against hope.

The EU Constitution Can Work
The final stage in drafting an EU Constitutional Treaty is underway.
Smaller and bigger EU members seem to be lining up in opposing camps.
Here Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen offers his hopes for what type of treaty will emerge.
After the historic decision on enlargement, the European Union now faces the task of making a Union with 25 or more Member States a success.
That is the task of the Intergovernmental Conference, which started its work on October 4th.
Governments of the 15 current member states and the 10 new members will negotiate a Constitutional Treaty that will form the framework for European co-operation in the future.
We aim for a Treaty that can stand for several years without further changes.
Denmark has a clear goal in these talks: to ensure a strong, democratic and transparent Union.
The Intergovernmental Conference works on the basis of the draft Treaty presented by the European Convention.
The Convention worked in full transparency for more than a year, designing a single, consolidated draft Treaty that was agreed upon by a broad consensus among its members.
The Convention's draft Treaty provides for a more simple and comprehensible structure for the EU based on more democratic and transparent co-operation between member states.
Indeed, it underlines the fact that the member states are the defining building blocks of the EU and defines the competences of the Union clearly.
The Intergovernmental Conference should therefore not re-open the main political compromises of the Convention.
There are, however, a number of questions that need further deliberation.
This is the case with some of the more technical issues relating to individual policy areas. And it is especially the case concerning institutional questions.
Denmark therefore fully supports the Italian Presidency's aim to complete the work of the Intergovernmental Conference by the end of the year.
Like the Italian President, we believe the negotiations should focus mainly on the central institutional questions.
Denmark's priorities are clear.
The new Treaty must fulfil two basic demands:
it must respect the central role of member states and it must maintain the balance between larger and smaller members;
the institutional structure must be efficient, democratic, and transparent.
The three central institutional questions confronting the Intergovernmental Conference are the future organization of the Commission and the Council, as well as determining the role of the future President of the European Council.
We must find a solution that realizes the full potential of all three actors.
Denmark presented a proposal on how to strengthen the organization of the Commission that reflects two considerations.
On the one hand, the principle of one commissioner per Member State with full voting powers carries great importance to many member states and to many citizens.
At the same time, we must ensure that the Commission can work effectively with 25 or more members.
Our proposal seeks to retain the Convention's idea of limiting the number of portfolios in the Commission while giving all commissioners full voting rights.
We suggest that the work of the Commission be concentrated in 15-19 portfolios. The heaviest portfolios should be shared among a number of commissioners, one of them responsible for coordination.
This model will ensure an efficient Commission with strong public legitimacy.
Strengthening the Commission must go hand in hand with strengthening the Council.
It is not a zero-sum game.
The Council Presidency, in my view, should remain embedded in the member states.
With 25 and more members, however, it is necessary to improve the present rotating Presidency (in particular the lack of continuity).
While being open towards the idea of a "Team Presidency" involving, for example, three countries for a period of one year or eighteen months, I worry that it would make horizontal co-ordination and the smooth daily conduct of business more difficult.
Therefore, I believe that we should modernize the present rotating Presidency.
But whether we continue with the current format for the Presidency or introduce a team model, we must consider how the President of the European Council can play a role in coordinating work within the Council.
The purpose of the European Council Chair is to ensure the coherence and decision-making capacity of the European Council. He or she must of course be given the necessary means to perform this task.
At the same time we must avoid creating a presidential system that functions independently of the Council, the Commission, and the member states.
But if we do not integrate the President of the European Council into the existing institutional structure and relegate the presidency to presiding over the meetings of the European Council, we will miss an important chance to strengthen the overall decision-making capacity of the Union.
We also risk creating competing structures that will weaken the institutions as a whole.
Denmark seeks an ambitious result in the institutional negotiations.
We wish to strengthen the EU's ability to solve the problems of the member states.
In order to accomplish this goal, we owe it to ourselves to create a strong, democratic, and transparent framework for co-operation in an enlarged Union.

The Reality of Virtual Power
DAVOS – As Arab regimes struggle with demonstrations fueled by Twitter and Al Jazeera, and American diplomats try to understand the impact of WikiLeaks, it is clear that this global information age will require a more sophisticated understanding of how power works in world politics.
That is the argument of my new book, The Future of Power.
Two types of power shifts are occurring in this century – power transition and power diffusion.
The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern, but power diffusion is a more novel process.
The problem for all states today is that more is happening outside the control of even the most powerful of them.
As for power transition, much attention nowadays is lavished on a supposed American decline, often with facile historical analogies to Britain and Rome.
But Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the apogee of its power, and, even then, it did not succumb to the rise of another state, but suffered a death by a thousand cuts inflicted by various barbarian tribes.
Indeed, for all the fashionable predictions that China, India, or Brazil will surpass the United States in the coming decades, the greatest threats may come from modern barbarians and non-state actors.
In an information-based world of cyber-insecurity, power diffusion may be a greater threat than power transition.
What will it mean to wield power in the global information age of the twenty-first century?
Which resources will produce power?
Every age produces its own answers.
In the sixteenth century, control of colonies and gold bullion gave Spain the edge; seventeenth-century Holland profited from trade and finance; eighteenth-century France gained from its larger population and armies; and nineteenth-century British power rested on industrial and naval primacy.
Conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails.
In an information age, however, it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins.
Today, it is far from clear how to measure a balance of power, much less how to develop successful survival strategies for this new world.
Most current projections of a shift in the global balance of power are based primarily on one factor: projections of countries’ GDP growth.
They thus ignore the other dimensions of power, including both hard military power and the soft power of narrative, not to mention the policy difficulties of combining them into successful strategies.
States will remain the dominant actor on the world stage, but they will find the stage far more crowded and difficult to control.
A much larger part of their populations than ever before has access to the power that comes from information.
Governments have always worried about the flow and control of information, and the current period is not the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology.
What is new – and what we see manifested in the Middle East today – is the speed of communication and the technological empowerment of a wider range of actors.
The current information age, sometimes called the “Third Industrial Revolution,” is based on rapid technological advances in computers, communications, and software, which in turn have led to a dramatic fall in the cost of creating, processing, transmitting, and searching for information of all kinds.
And this means that world politics can no longer be the sole province of governments.
As the cost of computing and communication comes down, the barriers to entry decline.
Individuals and private organizations, ranging from corporations to NGOs to terrorists, have thus been empowered to play a direct role in world politics.
The spread of information means that power will be more widely distributed, and informal networks will undercut the monopoly of traditional bureaucracy. The speed of Internet time means that all governments will have less control over their agendas.
Political leaders will enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events, and then will have to compete with an increasing number and variety of actors in order to be heard.
We see this as American policymakers struggle to cope with today’s Middle East disturbances.
The fall of the Tunisian regime had deep domestic roots, but the timing caught outsiders, including the US government, by surprise.
Some observers attribute the acceleration of the revolution to Twitter and WikiLeaks.
As the Obama administration formulates policy towards Egypt and Yemen, it faces a dilemma.
In Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime has provided important assistance in dealing with the threat from Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorism.
In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak’s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region.
Simplistic endorsement of democracy by George W. Bush’s administration was costly both in Iraq and in Gaza, where elections gave rise to a hostile Hamas-led government.
In an information age, smart policy combines hard and soft power.
Given what the US is, the Obama administration cannot afford to neglect the soft-power narrative of democracy, liberty, and openness.
Thus, Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have issued public as well as private appeals for reform and change in Egypt and the wider Arab world, while also urging limits to violence by all parties.
Moreover, they have aligned themselves with freedom of information in the face of efforts by the Egyptian regime to block Internet access.
How events in the Middle East will play out is anyone’s guess, but in today’s information age, upholding the freedom to access it will be an important component of smart power.

Re-Booting Emerging Europe
LONDON – After the 1997-1998 financial crisis, policymakers in Asia’s major emerging markets – South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and even Indonesia – vowed “never again” to be humiliated by international capital markets.
They set out to address the structural weaknesses that had brought their systems down.
Many countries in emerging Europe had similar near-death experiences in the recent global crisis.
Thanks to international and national policy interventions, their currencies and banking systems were saved from collapse, but many of them saw massive output drops and soaring unemployment.
Unfortunately, they have not to the same extent embraced their Asian counterparts’ determination to address the vulnerabilities.
Following the Asian crisis, the region’s economies underwent intense internal and external scrutiny.
It was clear that they had become more vulnerable due to loss of competitiveness, weak governance, and lack of transparency.
Badly regulated banking sectors, feeble market structures, and weak competition, as well as trade and current-account restrictions, were also among the shortcomings identified.
Not all Asian countries walked the line to the same extent, and some opportunities for reform were undoubtedly lost, but important lessons were learned and institutions improved.
Similarly, emerging economies in Latin America changed their economic-policy course after devastating crises – in some cases a series of them – and moved toward strengthening monetary frameworks to reduce dollarization and build local capital markets, liberalize markets, and improve governance.
These measures contributed to the improved economic fundamentals that helped limit the impact of the global financial crisis.
The countries of emerging Europe must go through a similar bout of introspection, but the fact that they were saved from worst-case scenarios seems to make it more difficult to launch this process.
The region needs to find its way back not only to rapid growth, but also to safer, more sustainable growth.
In the decade leading up to the crisis, the emerging European economies were remarkably successful.
Many of them grew at rates that compared favorably to other emerging markets, if not to China.
In terms of exports, they did almost as well as, and in some respects even surpassed, the Chinese.
But it was clear even before the crisis that emerging Europe was losing many of the strengths that explained its success.
Labor costs grew much faster than for most competitors.
In Latvia, for example, unit labor costs grew ten times faster than in the United States from 2001-2008.
Similarly, the potential gains from improved trade arrangements were being exhausted as they joined the European Union.
Looking ahead, the region’s main export markets, primarily in advanced Europe, are not expected to grow as fast as in the past.
Moreover, the region had relied excessively on foreign savings to support growth, with many countries running large long-term current-account deficits.
A significant part was financed by non-debt-creating inflows of foreign direct investment, but external borrowing, particularly by the private sector, also grew very rapidly.
Foreign financing fueled foreign-currency credit growth, even for borrowers without foreign-currency income.
As a result, the exchange-rate risk was passed on to those least able to manage it: households.
And banks were saddled with large exposures.
As wages grew faster than productivity in the run-up to the crisis, competitiveness also suffered, and domestic demand became the main engine of growth.
Easy access to cheap funding and high commodity prices alleviated the need to press ahead with difficult reforms of infrastructure, utilities, education, and health care, to name a few areas.
Diversification of production took a back seat in policy decisions as commodity prices continued to fuel rapid growth.
Emerging Europe needs new sources of competitiveness. There are still important gains to be had from further improvements in the broader business environment.
A large-scale survey of business managers, reported in this year’s EBRD Transition Report, reveals grave concerns with the availability of skilled labor, the predictability and transparency of taxation, and corruption.
There are no shortcuts to progress on addressing these problems, but lessons from the region should inspire emulation.
Some countries, like Hungary, have managed to sustain the quality of education, critical for long-term competitiveness.
Estonia has shown the way towards a simplified tax administration, modeled on the Scandinavian experience.
Georgia has managed to reduce low-level corruption radically, through deep staff cuts, improved compensation to remaining government employees, and stiffer penalties for bribery.
Emerging Europe’s fundamental growth model is sound. If these economies introduce the necessary reforms, they will improve their potential growth.
Equally important, they will create the buffers needed to offset external shocks and, as in emerging Asia and Latin America, to implement countercyclical policies that contain the extent and costs of future systemic crises.

Who Should Be Helped First?
The list of urgent challenges facing humanity is depressingly long.
AIDS, hunger, armed conflict, and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure, malaria, and the latest natural disaster.
While our compassion is great, our resources are limited.
So who should be helped first?
To some, making such priorities seems obscene.
But the United Nations and national governments spend billions of dollars each year trying to help those in need without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most that they can.
The western media focuses on a tsunami in Asia; donations flow freely.
An earthquake that devastates Pakistan garners fewer headlines, so the developed world gives a lot less.
There is a better way.
We could prioritize our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our money.
This month, I will ask UN ambassadors how they would spend $50 billion to reduce suffering.
They will repeat the same exercise that some of the world’s best economists tackled in a 2004 project called the “Copenhagen Consensus”: weighing up solutions to the great challenges facing the world, and deciding what should be done first.
But the question shouldn’t be left to politicians or Nobel laureates alone.
We must all engage in the debate.
One hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the Copenhagen Consensus economists boil down their insights.
Here’s one fact to consider: the entire death toll from the Southeast Asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casualties of HIV/AIDS.
A comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by HIV/AIDS would cost $27 billion and save more than 28 million lives.
This, say the economists who took part in the Copenhagen Consensus, makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly make.
The social benefits would outweigh the costs by 40 to one.
Other options that the economists favored spending some of their $50 billion include providing micro-nutrients to the world’s hungry, establishing free trade, and battling malaria with mosquito nets and medication.
At the other end of the scale, responses to climate change like the Kyoto Protocol would cost more than they would achieve, so the economists crossed them off the list of things to do right now.
Regardless of whether we agree with the economists, everybody must admit that we cannot do everything at once.
Discussing our priorities is crucial.
Often, politicians avoid prioritization.
Why?
The glib answer is because it is hard.
There are many interested parties.
No group wants their solution to come last, and no government wants its country’s national challenges to be overlooked.
The UN conference won’t be easy.
But it shows that there is a will to put prioritization squarely at the center of attention.
It will produce a “to do” list that will demonstrate how to achieve the most that we can for humanity, which could lead, in turn, to more transparent decision-making.
The principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choices.
Now, the discussion needs to shift from the academic sphere to political life.
It’s time for all of us to consider and compare our own priority lists.
We must endeavor to shorten the list of challenges facing humanity.
But that requires all of us to engage in a debate about what we need to do first.

Navigating the Syrian Endgame
STOCKHOLM – After a suspiciously sudden conversion, Russian President Vladimir Putin now claims to be worried about the fate of millions of refugees who have fled the carnage in Syria.
In a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin expressed his hope that the European Union would help to rebuild Syria so that its displaced people could start to return home.
And in recent weeks, Russian diplomats have been hawking the same message across European capitals.
To be sure, now that Bashar al-Assad’s regime has reclaimed most of the country’s territory, Syria’s civil war is clearly winding down.
But that outcome was not inevitable.
On the contrary, the Syrian army was very close to collapsing at one point.
Only with the crucial help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air support did Assad manage to turn things around.
Meanwhile, US efforts to establish a “moderate” armed opposition achieved little, apart from giving the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) – an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – control of the strip of northern Syria abutting the Turkish border.
The only thing left to do now is to destroy Al Nusra’s remaining enclave in Idlib and broker some kind of settlement between the YPG and Assad.
Assad has survived at a horrible cost.
More than half of the Syrian population has been displaced internally or forced to flee to nearby countries or to Europe.
Much of Syria’s infrastructure – from housing blocks to hospitals – lies in ruins.
And, needless to say, the country’s economy has been shattered, owing to the direct effects of the conflict and to sanctions that were imposed as part of the failed effort to force Assad into a political settlement.
No other country in the past half-century has suffered so heavy a toll in human lives and physical destruction.
There can be no doubt that the responsibility for this tragedy rests with the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian sponsors. Of course, they will say they were fighting terrorism, as if that excuses their indiscriminate methods and reckless disregard for civilian lives.
But future generations will remember the true source of the terror that was visited upon the Levant over the past seven years.
The estimated cost of rebuilding Syria varies widely.
While a 2017 World Bank study puts the price at around $225 billion, more recent assessments suggest a total closer to $400 billion; others expect the sum to approach $1 trillion.
And that does not even count the human costs of the war.
It is clear from Putin’s European charm offensive that Russia has no intention of footing even a small part of the bill.
Apparently, the Kremlin does not feel as though it has a duty to rebuild the cities and restore the livelihoods that its bombs destroyed.
Nor is the United States particularly eager to help.
Just last week, the Trump administration canceled $230 million in funding for the reconstruction of Raqqa and other areas liberated from ISIS.
It is now hoping that Saudi Arabia will foot the bill instead.
If there is any wisdom in that move, it remains to be seen.
With the US stepping back, it is obvious why Putin suddenly wants to talk to the Europeans about the plight of Syrian refugees.
He didn’t care about them when his bombs were falling on their neighborhoods and forcing them to flee.
But now that he wants Europe to bail out Assad, he has found some compassion.
But it is not clear that Assad even wants displaced Syrians to return. If anything, he seems ready to exploit the situation to reengineer the country’s ethnic and political composition, making it safer for his own minority sect, the Alawites.
Hence, a new law grants refugees just one year to reclaim their property before the government seizes it; and other bureaucratic requirements seem designed to allow Syrian authorities to refuse reentry to anyone they don’t like.
Moreover, Assad has stated explicitly that European companies are not welcome to help with the reconstruction, and that preference should be given to Russian firms.
Clearly, the regime is preparing to profit from any rebuilding assistance that comes its way.
For all of these reasons, the last thing that Europeans should do is send money directly to Assad.
A far better option is to offer direct financial support to individuals and families that are willing and able to return to their country.
At the same time, the EU should not lift sanctions until a credible political settlement between the regime and opposition forces has been reached.
The question is whether such a settlement is even possible.
So far, every realistic proposal has been torpedoed by Assad’s insistence that he remain in power.
Assad would do well to remember that he now rules over the wreckage of a country.
Even when the guns fall silent, his regime will not be secure.
His inability to revive Syria will leave him vulnerable in the same way that his refusal to countenance political reforms did eight years ago.
Europe has no interest in saving Assad from that dilemma.
Help for Syria must await a genuine political solution.
After the destruction that the Assad regime has wrought, there is no other way forward.

China’s Shift to City-Led Growth
SHANGHAI – China has achieved some four decades of rapid economic growth.
But one powerful source of growth has yet to be fully tapped: urbanization.
Now, the potential of megacities as an engine of dynamism and increased prosperity is finally getting the high-level attention it deserves.
Over the last decade, China has been working to shift from a manufacturing-led growth model fueled by low-cost labor to an innovation-led, higher-value-added model underpinned by strong productivity gains.
Urbanization will be critical to facilitate this shift, not least by enabling economies of scale.
Currently, though China is the world’s most populous country and its second-largest economy, only half the population lives in urbanized areas, and less than 10% reside permanently in megacities.
And the country’s urbanization rate remains well below the global average.
Growth in China’s megacities – metropolitan areas with a population exceeding ten million – has long been heavily constrained by rigid state administrative divisions and planning agencies.
Indeed, in pursuing rapid industrialization, megacities have often been less successful than smaller cities – which have largely evaded such constraints – in accumulating productive capital, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), and demonstrating entrepreneurial spirit.
In the 1990s, the small city of Kunshan became China’s leading center for manufacturing electronic products.
By integrating themselves into global supply chains, small cities in Guangdong province – including Dongguan, Huizhou, Shunde, and Zhongshan – have played a critical role in establishing China as the “Factory of the World.”
But while the success of smaller cities is to be celebrated, it is China’s megacities where the greatest potential to fuel future progress in productivity – and thus GDP growth – is to be found.
So far, China has just four “first-tier” cities (with populations exceeding 20 million): Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
Given the size of China’s population and economy, that is not a lot.
And, in fact, there is no reason to believe that these megacities have reached their capacity, in terms of population or contribution to economic growth.
Moreover, China has many dynamic second-tier cities – such as Chengdu, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Suzhou – that are capable of reaching first-tier status, if given the chance.
In order to maximize the potential of China’s cities, the government will need to be much more adaptive and flexible, especially regarding its notoriously strict control of urban land-development ratios. In particular, China must abandon its land-quota system, which not only limits the amount of land cities can develop for future productivity growth, but also allocates a disproportionate share of land to factories.
Otherwise, urbanization will continue pushing up already-high housing costs, but not efficiently enough to power sustained growth and development.
The good news is that local governments are already working with the central government to alleviate or even eliminate existing administrative constraints.
In China, cities’ administratively defined boundaries include both urban and rural jurisdictions, with the latter – called the “county” – engaged mainly in agriculture.
For example, about half of Shanghai’s administrative jurisdiction of 6,340 square kilometers (2,448 square miles) is rural.
Local governments are now introducing so-called county-district conversions, in order to expand urban districts into rural jurisdictions.
Such efforts, which the central government broadly supports, will enable more housing construction and industrial and commercial expansion.
Another strategy for advancing China’s transition toward a city-led growth model is to expand the role played by urban clusters that leverage the strength of first-tier cities to boost growth in less-developed areas.
From an economic standpoint, the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas – which encompass megacities like Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen – are undoubtedly the most important such urban agglomerations, set to generate the higher future productivity gains from economies of scale and complementarity.
Here, too, China’s leadership has already caught on.
This past March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced a plan for the development of a city cluster in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, which covers nine cities, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as the special administration regions of Hong Kong and Macau.
From 2010 to 2016, the annual GDP of the Greater Bay Area soared from CN¥5.42 trillion ($82 billion) to CN¥9.35 trillion ($1.42 trillion), making it the world’s third-largest urban economy, after Tokyo and New York.
Yet the population of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area is growing fast, and its GDP per capita is less than half that of Tokyo, suggesting that its potential is nowhere near depleted.
Moreover, China’s leaders seem to be eyeing a second greater bay area, centered on Hangzhou Bay, which, because it overlaps with the Yangtze River Delta, could go a long way toward integrating that already-prosperous region.
Such a cluster could cover the coastal megacity of Shanghai, as well as about ten more important cities across the Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces.
It would include world-class ports, such as the Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan (the world’s busiest in terms of cargo tonnage).
And it would cover two of China’s 11 existing free-trade zones.
The result would be a bay area on the scale of San Francisco and Tokyo.
The pace of China’s economic growth over the last four decades has been unprecedented.
But China has yet to complete its rise to rich-country status.
As it upgrades its economy to become more knowledge-based and technology-driven, it is again leveraging its strengths.
There is no better example of this than the ongoing effort to tap the potential of megacities.

Blair’s European Dilemma
Tony Blair has achieved a remarkable third successive electoral victory.
But his sharply reduced majority in the House of Commons, and his damaged personal reputation, mean that his political position is seriously weakened.
As a result, he will be poorly placed to handle the challenges ahead, the most intractable of which will be the European Union’s new Constitution.
The Constitution, adopted by the 25 member states last year, is not, in itself, a big deal.
It introduces some significant improvements for majority voting in the Council of Ministers. It gives some more powers to the European Parliament.
It includes a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It might help harmonize the foreign policies of the member states.
But it is no revolutionary document.
According to normal British constitutional practice, the government would be expected to ratify this Constitution by a vote in the House of Commons; and, until the recent general election, the government’s huge majority should have been more than sufficient. But Blair, beset by controversy over the unpopular and possibly illegal war in Iraq, thought he could avoid trouble at Westminster by postponing ratification until 2006 (that is, a comfortably long time in the future), and proposing that it be carried out by popular referendum.
Unfortunately, as things stand, this is a referendum that Blair will not win, because all polls show a large and solid majority against the European Constitution.
Blair’s government may hope to be rescued by outside events.
France will hold a referendum on the Constitution for the end of this month, and a French “No,” the British seem to think, might make their problem go away.
For the general expectation is that if France rejects the Constitution, the Constitution would be dead, and no British referendum would be needed.
If this is Blair’s calculation, he is mistaken.
Moreover, it is the kind of mistake that the British have been making in relations with Europe for the past half-century.
Some recent French polls now show a majority in favor of the Constitution. But even if the French do vote “No,” that will not solve the British problem: on the contrary, it will precipitate a major political crisis, in France and across Europe, concerning the future of the EU – the type of crisis that the British have spent fifty years trying to evade.
For if the Constitution is indeed dead, what happens next?
None of the leading members of the Union will be interested in Britain’s views on this question.
When Tony Blair swept to power in 1997, he was widely welcomed throughout Europe as the most pro-European British Prime Minister since Edward Heath a quarter of a century earlier. He spoke French and seemed at ease with Britain’s neighbors across the Channel; more importantly, he seemed to sympathize with European integration.
Eight years on, Europe knows better.
It is now clear to all that Blair is fundamentally opposed to the idea of a more politically integrated Europe.
Not only has he kept Britain out of the single European currency over the past four years, he made it clear during the election campaign that he does not expect the UK to join the Euro during the next five years either.
Occasionally Blair flirts with the idea of more European cooperation on foreign policy and defense.
But the past three years proved in practice that he prefers subservience to the war policy of President Bush to any sense of community with Europe.
In short, Blair is as opposed to the European project as all his predecessors.
One fundamental difference between France and Britain is that most of the mainstream political elite in France has long been broadly pro-European. If the French electorate votes “No,” it will be much less a vote against the Constitution than a protest vote against President Jacques Chirac, or an expression of anxiety about the implications of the EU’s enlargement to Central Europe.
By contrast, Blair cannot win a referendum on the Constitution, not only because it is opposed by virtually all the popular press, but also because neither he nor any major political leader in Britain has ever had a good word to say about European integration.
The crisis over the Union’s future direction triggered by a French “No” vote could last for some time.
But if the British imagine that the Constitution will just die, and that that will be the end of the story, they are deceiving themselves.
On the contrary, they will find themselves embroiled, like the rest of Europe, in a fundamental debate about the objectives of the Union.
They will then be forced to make public and explicit choices about the sort of Europe that they want, and this will put them at odds with their neighbors.
In the end, the French and other leading member states are likely to explore alternative ways of working towards a more politically integrated Europe.
The most plausible institutional mechanism for this alternative way forward will be the existing grouping of those member states that have wanted to belong to a more united Europe by joining, or seeking to join, the euro zone. If the Constitution is rejected, the British, having chosen to stay out of that grouping, may find that they have maneuvered themselves into an even more remote outer circle of Europe.

The End of Boris’s Illusion
LONDON – “Desperate, deluded PM clings to power,” reads the front page of the Guardian’s July 7, 2022, print edition.
But can UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s bizarre behavior really be chalked up to some mental disorder?
Such facile claims are all too common in today’s media environment.
In Johnson’s case, it is difficult to find coverage that does not offer some kind of psychiatric diagnosis.
If there is any debate, it is over what particular emotional malady he exhibits, not whether there is any other psychological explanation for his surreal antics.
Following an unprecedented wave of ministerial resignations this week, Johnson almost had to have the keys to No. 10 Downing Street wrenched from his hands, so staunch was his refusal to accept the obvious logic of his predicament.
Even in his speech finally announcing that he will resign, he blamed his ouster on a “herd instinct” among his Conservative Party colleagues, and suggested that it is rather “eccentric” to change leaders now.
But is he “deluded”?
To psychiatrists, that is a technical term with a precise meaning.
Victims of delusion will cling to beliefs that are clearly false, even in the face of overwhelming evidence.
But even if someone meets these criteria, that doesn’t really tell us what we need to know.
We also must ask what makes the person so resistant to reasoned argument, and what accounts for his or her own serious errors in judgment.
Leadership psychology suggests that precisely the same elements that make some leaders popular also can bring about their eventual downfall.
An elected leader’s psychodrama thus often reflects a polity’s own unconscious: we sometimes end up with deluded leaders because we ourselves can be somewhat delusional when we vote.
David Collinson, a professor of leadership and organization at Lancaster University, associates this predicament with excessive positive thinking, or what he calls “Prozac leadership,” in reference to the famous antidepressant that promises to cheer people up without actually fixing what is wrong in their lives.
“Prozac leadership,” Collinson writes, “encourages leaders to believe their own narratives that everything is going well and discourages followers from raising problems or admitting mistakes.”
In politics, Prozac leaders come to power by selling the electorate on wildly overoptimistic views of the future.
When the public buys into a Prozac leader’s narrative, it is they who are already verging on the delusional.
A country that ends up with such leaders may be suffering and miserable, desperately in need of an artificial pick-me-up.
Collinson’s term would certainly seem to describe Johnson, a man famous for his bonhomie and relentless cheerfulness.
It is worth remembering that before his political career took off, Johnson often appeared on TV comedy programs.
But no one is laughing now.
Prozac leaders inevitably become victims of their own positivity, refusing to consider evidence that contradicts their rosy assessments.
Even when everything is collapsing around them, they will focus on the positive, convincing themselves that there is still a way out of the abyss.
Some might also categorize Donald Trump as a Prozac leader.
When he clearly lost the 2020 US presidential election, he convinced his followers that they had actually won and would yet prevail.
But whether Trump believed his own narrative has increasingly come into doubt.
The congressional January 6 Committee has marshaled ample evidence showing that he knew full well that he had lost.
Another potential example is Vladimir Putin, who has conjured a kind of nostalgic dream world for his followers and the wider Russian public.
He may genuinely believe that his chances of conquering Ukraine are better than they are, given reports that he has been receiving bad information from his own generals.
Collinson regards performative positivity as a distinctive feature of contemporary culture.
For corporate and political leaders, upbeat self-promotion has become de rigueur.
To Johnson’s mind, it might seem obvious that one must project strength, power, and self-confidence.
By contrast, in his own resignation letter, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak chastised Johnson for hiding negative truths from the public.
“Our country is facing immense challenges,” Sunak writes. “We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world-class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices, and take difficult decisions.”
Most people know that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
It is one thing to tell the public that a better future is possible; it is quite another to claim that getting there will be easy.
The mark of Prozac leaders is that they will never allow their truth to collide with reality; rather, they will forever dodge it.
In his resignation speech, Johnson clung to the belief that “even if things can sometimes seem dark now, our future together is golden.”
It now falls to the British public to bring itself back down to Earth.
Positivity for its own sake can take a country only so far.

Conservation With a Human Face
PARIS – The world is witnessing a drastic decline of its natural capital.
Plant and animal species worldwide are vanishing at an unprecedented pace – 100 to 1,000 times the natural extinction rate.
The planet’s most endangered ecosystems are located in developing countries, and thus depend on some of the world’s neediest communities for their preservation.
Conversely, the poor are the first to suffer from deterioration of their natural environment.
But in the developing world, immediate economic needs often override long-term imperatives, and protecting a fragile environment is rarely a priority at the national level.
The biodiversity hosted by the world’s developing nations provides both local and global services.
Local, because the most fragile communities often rely for their survival on the biological resources that surround them, which constitute a precious source of food, energy and income. The World Bank estimates that natural capital constitutes a quarter of total wealth in low-income countries, compared to 3% in the highly developed economies.
Global, because the array of services that natural ecosystems provide, such as clean air and fresh water, benefit people far beyond national borders.
Destruction of these precious natural environments generates international ills.
Consider climate change: few people realize that tropical forest destruction accounts for 20% of overall carbon emissions – more than the world’s cars, trucks, and airplanes combined.
Halting the cutting and burning of tropical forests, which are found almost exclusively in developing nations, is among the most readily achievable and effective possible steps to reduce carbon emissions.
On the grounds that the environment in developing countries provides unique ecological services to the whole of mankind, some argue that their populations should not exploit the natural resources on their territories. But this would be ethically wrong, because developed nations have largely destroyed their own primary forests and ecosystems on the path to industrial development, and continue to import large quantities of raw material extracted in developing countries.
It would also be ineffective, because developing countries will – legitimately – refuse to assume by themselves the burden of protecting the world’s biodiversity to the detriment of their economic growth.
Thus, what is needed is a means to reconcile the task of helping some of the world’s poorest people with that of protecting irreplaceable ecosystems.
Addressing this two-fold challenge implies expanding the ability of local communities to manage the natural resources on which they depend.
The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), an international initiative launched eight years ago, is based on the principle that local communities themselves are the best trustees of the environment that surrounds them, and that their economic growth will advance their capacity to care for nature.
By focusing on “biodiversity hotspots” – regions with unique and highly threatened natural environments – the CEPF relies on the common-sense principle that protecting what nature provides for free is a crucial element of sustainable economic development. The Fund, by delivering financial and technical assistance to people and places that need it the most, has helped create more than nine million hectares of new protected areas – a region larger than Portugal.
Such conservation-based development projects prove that economic growth and environmental protection are not incompatible.
On the contrary, mounting environmental challenges in some of the world’s economically deprived regions will not be overcome in a context of poverty.
Development agencies and environmentalists must thus urgently work toward the convergence of development and conservation priorities. This is the kind of progress the world needs if it is to address effectively one of the most pressing issues of our time: providing a healthy, sustainable planet for rich and poor alike.

Controlling China’s Currency
BEIJING – It is indisputable that China is over-issuing currency.
But the reasons behind China’s massive liquidity growth – and the most effective strategy for controlling it – are less obvious.
The last decade has been a “golden age” of high growth and low inflation in China.
From 2003 to 2012, China’s annual GDP growth averaged 10.5%, while prices rose by only 3% annually.
But the unprecedented speed and scale of China’s monetary expansion remain a concern, given that it could still trigger high inflation and lead to asset-price bubbles, debt growth, and capital outflows.
Data from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) show that, as of the end of last year, China’s M2 (broad money supply) stood at ¥97.4 trillion ($15.6 trillion), or 188% of GDP.
To compare, M2 in the United States amounts to only roughly 63% of GDP.
In fact, according to Standard Chartered Bank, China ranks first worldwide in terms of both overall M2 and newly issued currency.
In 2011, China accounted for an estimated 52% of the world’s added liquidity.
But a horizontal comparison of absolute values is inadequate to assess the true scale of China’s monetary emissions.
Several other factors must be considered, including China’s financial structure, financing model, savings rate, and stage of economic development, as well as the relationship between currency and finance in China.
China’s intensive economic monetization is a key factor driving its money-supply growth.
But China’s sharply rising monetization rate cannot be judged against the high, steady rates of developed countries without bearing in mind that China’s monetization process began much later, and has distinct structural and institutional foundations.
As China has opened up its economy, deepened reforms, and become increasingly market-oriented, the government has facilitated the continuous monetization of resources – including natural resources, labor, capital, and technology – by ensuring their constant delivery to the market.
This has fueled rising demand for currency, leading to the expansion of the monetary base, with the money multiplier – that is, the effect on lending by commercial banks – boosting the money supply further.
And, as GDP growth has become increasingly dependent on government-led investment, currency demand has continued to rise.
Indeed, the rapid expansion of bank credit needed to finance skyrocketing government-led investment is increasing the amount of liquidity in China’s financial system.
As a result, in the last four years, China’s M2, spurred by a stimulus package totaling ¥4 trillion in 2008 and 2009, has more than doubled.
This trend is exacerbated by the declining efficiency of financial resources in the state sector, a product of the soft budget constraint implied by easily accessible, cheap capital.
Consequently, maintaining high GDP growth rates requires an ever-increasing volume of credit and a continuously growing money supply.
So China is stuck in a currency-creating cycle: GDP growth encourages investment, which boosts demand for capital.
This generates liquidity, which then stimulates GDP growth.
The key to controlling China’s monetary expansion is to clarify the relationship between currency (the central bank) and finance (the financial sector), thereby preventing the government from assuming the role of a second currency-creating body.
According to Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the PBOC, the relationship between the central bank and the financial sector entails both a division of labor and a system of checks and balances.
In theory, the financial sector serves as a kind of accountant for the treasury and the government, while the PBOC acts as the government’s cashier.
In practice, however, the relationship between currency and finance is vague, with both assuming quasi-fiscal functions.
China’s low official government debt largely reflects the role of currency in assuming quasi-fiscal liabilities – not only the write-off costs incurred from reforming state-owned banks, but also the takeover of banks’ bad debts via note financing and the purchase of asset-management companies’ bonds.
These activities both damage the PBOC’s balance sheet and constrain monetary policy.
At the same time, finance takes on quasi-fiscal functions by excluding government fiscal deposits – government deposits in the national treasury, commercial banks’ fiscal savings, and central treasury cash managed through commercial-bank deposits – from the money supply.
Given the large volume of fiscal deposits – which totaled ¥2.4 trillion (3.3% of M2) at the end of 2010 – their impact on the money supply cannot be ignored.
Clarifying the relationship between currency and finance is essential to ensuring that all newly issued currency is backed by assets.
Only by exerting a harder budget constraint on the state sector, limiting fiscal expansion, and reducing dependence on government-led investment can China’s excessive currency issuance be addressed in the long term.

A Made-in-China Pandemic
NEW DELHI – The new COVID-19 coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries – bringing social disruption, economic damage, sickness, and death – largely because authorities in China, where it emerged, initially suppressed information about it.
And yet China is now acting as if its decision not to limit exports of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and medical supplies – of which it is the dominant global supplier – was a principled and generous act worthy of the world’s gratitude.
When the first clinical evidence of a deadly new virus emerged in Wuhan, Chinese authorities failed to warn the public for weeks and harassed, reprimanded, and detained those who did.
This approach is no surprise: China has a long history of “killing” the messenger. Its leaders covered up severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus, for over a month after it emerged in 2002, and held the doctor who blew the whistle in military custody for 45 days.
SARS ultimately affected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries.
This time around, the Communist Party of China’s proclivity for secrecy was reinforced by President Xi Jinping’s eagerness to be perceived as an in-control strongman, backed by a fortified CPC.
But, as with the SARS epidemic, China’s leaders could keep it under wraps for only so long.
Once Wuhan-linked COVID-19 cases were detected in Thailand and South Korea, they had little choice but to acknowledge the epidemic.
About two weeks after Xi rejected scientists’ recommendation to declare a state of emergency, the government announced heavy-handed containment measures, including putting millions on lockdown.
But it was too late: many thousands of Chinese were already infected with COVID-19, and the virus was rapidly spreading internationally.
US National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has said that China’s initial cover-up “probably cost the world community two months to respond,” exacerbating the global outbreak.
Beyond the escalating global health emergency, which has already killed thousands, the pandemic has disrupted normal trade and travel, forced many school closures, roiled the international financial system, and sunk global stock markets.
With oil prices plunging, a global recession appears imminent.
None of this would have happened had China responded quickly to evidence of the deadly new virus by warning the public and implementing containment measures.
Indeed, Taiwan and Vietnam have shown the difference a proactive response can make.
Taiwan, learning from its experience with SARS, instituted preventive measures, including flight inspections, before China’s leaders had even acknowledged the outbreak.
Likewise, Vietnam quickly halted flights from China and closed all schools.
Both responses recognized the need for transparency, including updates on the number and location of infections and public advisories on how to guard against COVID-19.
Thanks to their governments’ policies, both Taiwan and Vietnam – which normally receive huge numbers of travelers from China daily – have kept total cases under 50.
Neighbors that were slower to implement similar measures, such as Japan and South Korea, have been hit much harder.
If any other country had triggered such a far-reaching, deadly, and above all preventable crisis, it would now be a global pariah.
But China, with its tremendous economic clout, has largely escaped censure.
Nonetheless, it will take considerable effort for Xi’s regime to restore its standing at home and abroad.
Perhaps that is why China’s leaders are publicly congratulating themselves for not limiting exports of medical supplies and APIs used to make medicines, vitamins, and vaccines.
If China decided to ban such exports to the United States, the state-run news agency Xinhua recently noted, the US would be “plunged into a mighty sea of coronavirus.”
China, the article implies, would be justified in taking such a step.
It would simply be retaliating against “unkind” US measures taken after COVID-19’s emergence, such as restricting entry to the US by Chinese and foreigners who had visited China.
Isn’t the world lucky that China is not that petty?
Maybe so.
But that is no reason to trust that China will not be petty in the future.
After all, China’s leaders have a record of halting other strategic exports (such as rare-earth minerals) to punish countries that defied them.
Moreover, this is not the first time China has considered weaponizing its dominance in global medical supplies and APIs.
Last year, Li Daokui, a prominent Chinese economist, suggested curtailing Chinese API exports to the US as a countermeasure in the trade war.
“Once the export is reduced,” Li noted, “the medical systems of some developed countries will not work.”
That is no exaggeration.
A US Department of Commerce study found that 97% of all antibiotics sold in the US come from China.
“If you’re the Chinese and you want to really just destroy us,” Gary Cohn, former chief economic adviser to US President Donald Trump, observed last year, “just stop sending us antibiotics.”
If the specter of China exploiting its pharmaceutical clout for strategic ends were not enough to make the world rethink its cost-cutting outsourcing decisions, the unintended disruption of global supply chains by COVID-19 should be.
In fact, China has had no choice but to fall behind in producing and exporting APIs since the outbreak – a development that has constrained global supply and driven up the prices of vital medicines.
That has already forced India, the world’s leading supplier of generic drugs, to restrict its own exports of some commonly used medicines.
Almost 70% of the APIs for medicines made in India come from China.
If China’s pharmaceutical plants do not return to full capacity soon, severe global medicine shortages will become likely.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the costs of Xi’s increasing authoritarianism.
It should be a wake-up call for political and business leaders who have accepted China’s lengthening shadow over global supply chains for far too long.
Only by loosening China’s grip on global supply networks – beginning with the pharmaceutical sector – can the world be kept safe from the country’s political pathologies.

Bonds of the Diaspora
WASHINGTON, DC – The goals of the post-2015 development agenda cannot be achieved without strong programs and adequate funding.
Official development assistance amounts to roughly $130 billion a year; though foreign-direct investment and portfolio inflows can help poor economies, additional sources of development finance must be found.
One under-exploited resource is diaspora financing – that is, the remittances and savings earned by nationals working abroad and sent home to family and friends.
The challenge is to channel this income effectively.
There are more than 230 million international migrants worldwide, which is more than the population of the world’s fifth most populous country, Brazil.
The estimated $2.6 trillion that they earn annually exceeds the GDP of the United Kingdom, the world’s sixth-largest economy.
Much of this income is taxed or spent in the host countries.
But, assuming a 20% saving rate (close to the average for developing countries), this implies total annual diaspora saving of more than $500 billion.
In 2013, migrants from developing countries sent home around $404 billion (excluding the vast unrecorded inflows that arrive through informal channels).
India received $70 billion, more than the value of its exports of information-technology services.
Remittances to Egypt were larger than the country’s earnings from the Suez Canal.
And expatriate earnings accounted for more than one-third of Tajikistan’s national income.
These inflows tend to be larger in poor and small economies, and often provide the main lifeline in fragile or conflict-affected countries. Remittances also arrive first in times of economic hardship and in the aftermath of natural disasters.
They tend to be more stable than private capital flows, declining by a mere 5% during the recent global financial crisis and recovering rapidly to pre-crisis levels.
Once the money is back in an expatriate’s homeland, it is put to good use.
Remittances have reduced poverty in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Nepal.
Children from recipient households in El Salvador have a lower school-dropout rate; in Sri Lanka, they have more access to private tutors.
The money finances health care, housing, and businesses.
Micro-finance borrowers can even use remittance receipts as evidence of credit history.
However, despite remittances’ evident value in supporting development goals, it must be remembered that they are private funds and should not be considered a substitute for official aid.
Attempts by governments to earmark remittances for specific “productive” uses have failed, especially in countries with weak investment environments.
Likewise, taxing remittances can hurt the poor disproportionately and drive the flows of money underground. Conversely, improving the investment climate is likely to increase the share of remittances invested into businesses.
Indeed, reducing high money-transfer charges – currently averaging more than 8% globally – has been shown to facilitate remittances and increase migrants’ savings.
The G-20 is now working to cut these costs to 5% in five years; a more aggressive target of 1% by 2030 could – and should – be set.
Mobile banking technology can help.
So can greater market competition, which has already lowered fees in major remittance corridors such as those linking the UAE to India and the Philippines, and the United States to Mexico.
Some banks and businesses now offer zero-cost remittance services to attract customers.
Governments could also relax regulations for small remittance transactions. Exclusive partnerships between national postal systems and money-transfer companies should also be abolished.
Another way to better use diaspora savings would be to create new “diaspora” financial instruments.
A low denomination security (of, say, $1,000), carrying a 3-4% interest rate, might be attractive to migrant workers who currently earn minimal interest on deposits held in host-country banks.
A five-year diaspora bond would have a lower interest rate than a sovereign bond sold to foreign institutional investors, as diaspora investors’ perception of risk in their home country is likely to be lower. The bonds would also be more stable than non-resident foreign-currency deposits in developing countries, and registering the bonds with the appropriate authorities in major host countries would make them reasonably safe.
But diaspora bonds will not be a feasible development instrument unless they are linked to development projects in places where there is sufficient trust in the government.
The bonds should be available to all investors, not just migrant savers, and be distributed widely, not kept on the books of a few investment banks. That way, large sums could be mobilized for development at low, stable interest rates, without diminishing migrant workers’ incentive to save.

The Specter of Global Stagflation
New York – Will rising global inflation lead to a sharp global economic slowdown? Even worse, will it revive stagflation, that deadly combination of rising inflation and negative growth?
Inflation is already rising in many advanced economies and emerging markets, and there are signs of likely economic contraction in many advanced economies (the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Japan). In emerging markets, inflation has – so far – been associated with growth, even economic overheating.
But economic contraction in the US and other advanced economies may lead to a growth recoupling – rather than decoupling – in emerging markets, as the US contraction slows growth and rising inflation forces monetary authorities to tighten monetary and credit policies.
They may then face “stagflation lite” – rising inflation tied to sharply slowing growth.
Stagflation requires a negative supply-side shock that increases prices while simultaneously reducing output.
Stagflationary shocks led to global recession three times in the last 35 years: in 1973-1975, when oil prices spiked following the Yom Kippur War and OPEC embargo; in 1979-1980, following the Iranian Revolution; and in 1990-91, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Even the 2001 recession – mostly triggered by the bursting high-tech bubble – was accompanied by a doubling of oil prices, following the start of the second Palestinian intifada against Israel.
Today, a stagflationary shock may result from an Israeli attack against Iran’s nuclear facilities. This geopolitical risk mounted in recent weeks as Israel has grown alarmed about Iran’s intentions.
Such an attack would trigger sharp increases in oil prices – to well above $200 a barrel. The consequences of such a spike would be a major global recession, such as those of 1973, 1979, and 1990.
Indeed, the most recent rise in oil prices is partly due to the increase in this fear premium.
But short of such a negative supply-side shock, is global stagflation possible?
Between 2004-2006 global growth was robust while inflation was low, owing to a positive global supply shock – the increase in productivity and productive capacity of China, India and emerging markets.
This positive supply-side shock was followed – starting in 2006 – by a positive global demand shock: fast growth in “Chindia” and other emerging markets started to put pressure on the prices of a variety of commodities.
Strong global growth in 2007 marked the beginning of a rise in global inflation, a phenomenon that, with some caveats (the sharp slowdown in the US and some advanced economies), continued into 2008.
Barring a true negative supply-side shock, global stagflation is thus unlikely.
Recent rises in oil, energy and other commodity prices reflect a variety of factors:
Most of these factors are akin to positive global aggregate demand shocks, which should lead to economic overheating and a rise in global inflation.
Exchange rate policies are key.
Large current-account surpluses and/or rising terms of trade imply that the equilibrium real exchange rate (the relative price of foreign to domestic goods) has appreciated in countries like China and Russia.
Thus, over time the actual real exchange rate needs to converge – via real appreciation – with the stronger equilibrium rate. If the nominal exchange rate is not permitted to appreciate, real appreciation can occur only through an increase in domestic inflation.
So the most important way to control inflation – while regaining the monetary and credit policy autonomy needed to control inflation – is to allow currencies in these economies to appreciate significantly. Unfortunately, the need for currency appreciation and monetary tightening in overheated emerging markets comes at a time when the housing bust, credit crunch, and high oil prices are leading to a sharp slowdown in advanced economies – and outright recession in some of them.
The world has come full circle.
Following a benign period of a positive global supply shock, a positive global demand shock has led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures.
Now the worries are about a stagflationary supply shock – say, a war with Iran – coupled with a deflationary demand shock as housing bubbles go bust. Deflationary pressure could take hold in economies that are contracting, while inflationary pressures increase in economies that are still growing fast.
Thus, central banks in many advanced and emerging economies are facing a nightmare scenario, in which they simultaneously must tighten monetary policy (to fight inflation) and ease it (to reduce the downside risks to growth). As inflation and growth risks combine in varied and complex ways in different economies, it will be very difficult for central bankers to juggle these contradictory imperatives.

President Lyndon Ronald Bush
President Bush has fired and replaced his Treasury Secretary and chief economic advisor.
Will those changes make any difference?
Economic historian Harold James sets the Bush economic strategy in its historical context and hears dangerous echoes of past American failures.
In the 1990s, the international economic and financial system was more stable than in previous decades, despite the turbulence of 1997-98.
But that stability is now disappearing fast--along with the fundamental consensus on which it rested.
One of the most important elements of the 1990s consensus--exported globally as the "Washington Consensus"--was the idea of fiscal responsibility.
In the US, the commitment to fiscal rectitude followed President Clinton's early realization that balanced budgets would stabilize financial markets, reduce borrowing costs, and thus generate higher growth. He carried this policy through a skeptical Congress, even at the price of abandoning many of the social welfare promises he made during his 1992 presidential campaign.
In Europe, meanwhile, the consensus was embodied in the European Union's Growth and Stability Pact and made operational in the rigid Maastricht criteria that capped government budget deficits at 3% of GDP.
Now the fiscal consensus of the 1990s is under sustained attack worldwide.
Portugal, Germany, and France proudly declare their intention to deviate from the Maastricht criteria. But it is America that is leading the attack on fiscal discipline.
The US federal budget deficit for 2001-2 was $159 billion, quite respectable (in percentage terms) by European standards.
But more red ink is likely, owing to the current administration's irresponsible commitment to tax reduction, and, unlike Clinton, or, indeed, the first President Bush, George W. Bush does not intend to break his campaign promises.
President Bush's view on taxation is strikingly different from his predecessor's.
Bush's election program promised big tax cuts, which he followed through on. When asked about the ballooning deficit, he explained that "we have a deficit because tax revenues are down;" and that the tax relief package "has helped the economy, and that the deficit would have been bigger without the tax-relief package."
So, in Bush's eyes, tax cuts reduce the federal deficit.
But this is precisely the so-called "supply side" argument that the President's father once famously mocked as "voodoo" economics when Ronald Reagan expounded it.
Two scare stories underlie this theory.
The Japanese scare story of the 1990s, in which monetary and fiscal policy prove powerless in the face of a sustained deflation, is the economic trauma now used to rationalize Bush's vast 10-year program of tax cutting.
September 11 th is the second scare story.
At the beginning of 2002, the President proposed a $48 billion boost in military spending--a sum larger than the total defense budget of every country except Russia.
Overall, the new US military budget is $396 billion, just under 4% of GDP.
A war with Iraq would add around another $100 billion, or 1% of GDP, to the defense budget (the war in Afghanistan cost a humble $10 billion.)
Precedents abound in American history for using scare stories to justify fiscal expansion.
Indeed, today's bout of fiscal stimulation seems historically better founded than the brief episode of stability in the 1990s.
In the 1980s, President Reagan believed that America was losing its entrepreneurial edge, and that Japan and Europe were overtaking it, so he let the deficit rip.
In the 1960s, President Johnson feared the risk of a new 1930s-style Great Depression, and responded with an increase in domestic social spending ("the Great Society") at the same time as the escalation of the war in Vietnam boosted military expenditure.
In both periods, fiscal laxity stoked volatility in the foreign exchange markets, where the surge in inflation in the 1960s destroyed the fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods.
This generated a wave of mutual recrimination across the Atlantic, with Europeans (especially the French and the Germans) accusing the US of irresponsible inflationism, while Americans blamed Europe for refusing to grow fast enough.
The episode greatly strengthened anti-Americanism in Europe.
In the 1980s, the dollar first soared against the Yen and European currencies, then it collapsed.
Again, both sides of the Atlantic played a mutual blame game.
Such instability would matter little if it produced only dizzying movements on currency traders' computer screens. But those movements produce big changes in real exchange rates, i.e., in manufacturing competitiveness, and thus fuel demands for trade protection.
When the dollar strengthened at the end of the 1960s and in the mid-1980s, American industry felt threatened by foreign imports and pressed for changes in the trading regime.
A new wave of deficits and exchange-rate instability would thus call into question the most fundamental and beneficial legacy of the 1990s: the major push for trade opening and liberalization.
Sometimes people are so confident about the robustness of globalization that they assume that it can't be reversed: but this is exactly what each round of financial and economic turbulence threatens.
The world is now more integrated now than in the 1960s or in the 1980s.
Recent events suggest that we are more vulnerable that ever to a sudden and sharp backlash.

The TPP’s Second Act
CLAREMONT – When US President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) this past January, many observers saw that decision as a boon for China.
If so, it may not last.
The conventional wisdom is based on simple economic and geopolitical logic.
China has become every other Asian country’s largest trading partner, inexorably gaining strategic leverage as a result.
As China’s neighbors grow increasingly dependent on the Chinese market, the logic suggests, America’s influence in the region will gradually decline.
Former US President Barack Obama’s administration understood the far-reaching geopolitical consequences of China’s economic dominance in East Asia.
Obama and his advisers had hoped that, by creating a new US-centered trading bloc, the TPP would counter China’s clout and preserve American military and economic primacy in the world’s most dynamic region.
But while the consensus view that Trump has effectively ceded East Asia to China is not necessarily wrong, it overlooks a fundamental geopolitical fact: American preeminence has created a powerful incentive for free riding in East Asia.
As the region’s countries have grown accustomed to the US-furnished security umbrella and free-trade system, they have not invested in their own national and economic security. When they can no longer count on US-supplied public goods to maintain peace and deliver prosperity, they will face some tough choices.
One group of countries will undoubtedly jump on the Chinese bandwagon, hoping that closer ties with Asia’s future hegemon will give them what the US provides now.
This bloc includes countries ruled by autocratic regimes that have no ideological or territorial disputes with China, such as Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Laos.
Other countries have already adopted a hedging strategy, whereby they maintain close security relations with the US while taking advantage of China’s enormous market.
Australia, South Korea, and Singapore may fall into this category.
But a third group of countries appears to have opted for a self-help strategy.
As American protection and oversight of free trade have become increasingly uncertain, they have taken proactive measures to counter Chinese power on their own, not least by banding together.
The countries leading this charge are India and Japan – two great powers that cannot imagine living in a China-dominated Asia.
They are joined by countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which have also resisted falling into China’s orbit.
India and Japan are demonstrating that, through diplomacy and trade, Asia’s major powers can frustrate Chinese ambitions on their own.
To see this dynamic at work, we need look no further than Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s recent declaration that Japan will continue to push ahead with the TPP.
To be sure, without US participation, the remaining 11 Pacific-rim countries will have much less economic heft than they would have had under the original deal.
But in 2016, these countries’ combined GDP still exceeded $10 trillion, which is only slightly less than China’s GDP of $11 trillion.
The TPP has not yet been ratified by all of its 11 remaining signatories.
But if these countries can come together and push the agreement through, one can imagine that other Asian powers such as South Korea and Indonesia will be tempted to join.
These new additions, and the formation of a new regional trading bloc, could partly fill the void left by America’s withdrawal.
Of course, a self-help strategy to counterbalance China is not guaranteed to succeed.
Leadership and substantial sacrifice will also be critical.
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the US opened its markets and deployed its immense financial resources to reconstruct Japan and Western Europe’s devastated economies.
The Marshall Plan and other similar measures were part of America’s Cold War strategy against the Soviet Union.
And, in retrospect, we now know that these enlightened economic policies played just as crucial a role as military superiority in winning that conflict.
Fortunately, Asia today is not in the grip of a cold war.
But leading powers such as Japan and India must show that they are ready and willing to bear the costs of maintaining the region’s balance of power, and to prevent the emergence of a Sino-centric Asia.
Abe has declared his resolve.
Now he must back up his words with action.
To persuade wavering Asian countries to band together, rather than submit to China, Japan will have to adopt policies that demonstrate its willingness to absorb the high costs of keeping itself and its partners outside of China’s orbit.
If Abe’s Japan delivers on its pledge, even a smaller TPP could give China a run for its money in Asia.

The “What If?” of 1989
NEW YORK – For weeks, the scene has been re-played on TV screens around the world, as if the events were breaking news: joyous Berliners dancing atop the infamous Wall, toppled 20 years ago on November 9, 1989.
“Die Mauer ist Weg,” the people cried out, punching their fists in the air before the cameras at the Brandenburg Gate.
“The Wall is gone!”
Without doubt, it is one of the iconic images of the twentieth century.
For Americans, especially, it was the totemic emblem of victory in the Cold War.
Yet, if you were there that night, as I was for Newsweek, the moment is more ambiguous, especially with the hindsight of two decades.
Simply put, history could easily have happened very differently, and almost did.
Egon Krenz, the Communist boss of the German Democratic Republic, called it a “botch.”
He was savoring a rare moment of triumph when his party spokesman stopped by in the late afternoon of November 9.
“Anything to announce?” asked Günter Schabowski, innocently.
Krenz hesitated, then handed him a press release.
It was to announce a major initiative he had forced through parliament only hours earlier, and which the country’s restive people had been demanding in the streets for weeks: the right to travel.
Krenz intended to give it to them – but only the next day, November 10.
Oblivious to this critical fact, Schabowski went off and read it out to the world in a now-famous vignette.
“When does it take effect?” reporters asked.
Confused, Schabowski neglected the all-important date: “sofort,” he said.
“Immediately.”
In a heartbeat, the damage was done.
Astounded East Germans surged like a human sea to the crossing points to the West.
Border guards, receiving no instructions and not knowing what else to do, opened them up.
The rest is history.
Accident has always shaped human destiny.
Even so, it is worth asking, What if Schabowski had not messed up?
Imagine that, the next day, Krenz’s travel laws had taken effect in an orderly and efficient German way.
Strictly speaking, the Wall would not have fallen.
It would have been opened, not breached.
The Communists, not the people, would have done it.
Change might have come by evolution, not revolution.
Might Krenz and the Communist reformers who had seized power just weeks earlier have been able to channel popular unrest, or even defuse it?
Instead of a unified Germany today, could there still be two Germanys, East and West?
The “what if” game can be played out endlessly.
Without the drama of that night at the Wall, with all its inspiring visuals, would the Velvet Revolution in Prague have come one week later?
Would Romanians have found the courage to rise against Nicolae Ceausescu a month later?
The dominoes of Eastern Europe might have toppled differently.
A few might not have toppled at all.
Forty-eight hours after the first Germans clambered atop the Wall, I stood through a freezing night with several thousand West Berliners in the muddy no-man’s-land that was Potsdamer Platz at the old heart of pre-war Berlin.
The hump of Hitler’s bunker curved softly under the earth a football pitch or so away.
An East German construction crew was knocking a new passage through the Wall, and it was tough going.
A giant crane strained to lift a 12-foot-high slab, yanking it back and forth like some dinosaur gnawing its prey.
Finally, it gave way and was hoisted above the crowds, twisting slowly, as if from a gibbet.
Television spotlights illuminated its broken surface, scrawled with grafitti.
All the unresolved conflicts of Europe were on that chunk of painted concrete: a neo-Nazi swastika, surrealistic faces of Europe’s dead from war and Holocaust and secret police purges.
Most notable was a word: Freiheit.
Freedom.
How odd that it should be that slab, that word, that evening.
As the sun set in the west, a huge and perfect orange ball burning into the earth, the moon had risen in the east, as perfectly full and round as the sun, cool and bluish white.
It was as though they were in balance, moving on an invisible axis, with Berlin poised between them, at once suspended and a fulcrum.
Freiheit.
It was almost enough to make one believe in destiny, there in that haunted land of ghosts.
We often think of history as something inevitable, a culmination of great, grinding forces that can only lead to one destination.
But the reality of 1989, one of the organizers of the mass protests at the time told me, is that “it was possible at any point, at any time, for events to take a different course.”
Why this, not that?
The answer seems to consist in those countless individual choices at key moments, the accidents of human messiness, such as Schabowski’s “botch,” so small and so understandable, yet so earthshaking.
Among them, too, were the choices of courageous protestors to go into the streets, to speak out – or, as this particular protestor put it to me, not to have to explain to the next generation, “We sat and waited.”
Those dancing on the Wall, 20 years ago, made their choice.

Marginalizing Malaria
SAN FRANCISCO – Last fall, Bill and Melinda Gates sent shock waves through the global health community when they announced the audacious goal of eradicating human malaria from the face of the planet.
Nothing less, they urged, would be enough.
Heated debate immediately erupted, with some experienced practitioners questioning the feasibility of such a goal.
These skeptics pointed to the first Global Eradication Program, an ambitious effort in the 1950’s to clear malaria from many areas of the world (Africa was excluded).
Despite initial progress, eradication programs crumbled as donors, governments, and populations grew tired and turned their attention elsewhere, allowing malaria to resurge to devastating levels.
No one is suggesting a return to the failed strategies of the first eradication program.
The Gates Foundation has sensibly begun to facilitate consultations with leading scientists on accelerating the development of potent new tools, and is already funding the development of a vaccine, as well as new drugs and diagnostics.
At the same time, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership has recently launched a long-term Global Action Plan to unify the actions of the malaria community and spur additional investment.
All agree that eradication is decades away.
Yet, while total eradication is beyond the horizon, and new tools are needed to get there, there is much that can be achieved in the near term with our current armory.
Recent success in countries such as Ethiopia and Rwanda in expanding access to impregnated bed nets and slashing malaria rates is building confidence that the disease can be dramatically reduced around the world and, in some areas, eliminated entirely.
To realize this opportunity, a sound strategy must rapidly be developed and executed. In a recent article in the British scientific journal The Lancet , Oliver Sabot and I proposed such a strategy.
The approach is simple: a redoubled effort to reduce infections and deaths rapidly in the malaria “heartland” (i.e., equatorial Africa and a handful of other areas around the world) should be accompanied by a campaign to roll back the disease from its current margins.
Malaria has natural limits, determined by latitude, altitude and, in some cases, human intervention.
The countries at the fringe of this zone typically benefit from a range of factors that make complete elimination of malaria possible, including lower transmission of the disease, stronger health systems, and relative national wealth.
Most importantly, these countries are not surrounded by malaria.
As they successfully eliminate malaria, they will provide a new malaria-free anchor that will enable their neighbors, which have been pursuing aggressive control measures in the interim, to embark on their own eradication campaigns.
In this way, malaria will literally be rolled back from its current borders.
This strategy has begun to emerge organically, without prompting from the global community.
In the Pacific, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, at the far southeastern margin of the malaria endemic zone, have embarked on an eradication campaign with support from the Australian government.
Across the globe, the Southern Africa Development Community has set a goal of eliminating malaria from its four southernmost members – Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland – by 2015.
To do so, they are in active discussions with their northern neighbors, and innovative cross-border collaborations are being developed, building on the model of the highly successful partnership between Mozambique, South Africa, and Swaziland.
Other malaria margins where eradication efforts are underway are China, the Philippines, and Central America.
More than one million people die each year from malaria, most of them are children.
Yet malaria is a preventable and treatable disease.
The task of eliminating malaria, country by country, and eventually reaching global eradication, is underway.
This time, we must not rest until it is completed.

The G7 Must Act to Vaccinate the World
LONDON – “Nobody is safe until everyone is safe” is the defining mantra of the COVID-19 era.
It captures a fundamental truth.
Faced with a virus that recognizes no borders, no country is an island - and there is no substitute for international solidarity.
The June G7 summit in the UK provides political leaders of the world’s richest countries an opportunity to demonstrate that solidarity.
They should seize it by agreeing on a financial plan of action to underpin humanity’s battle with COVID-19, starting with equitable access to vaccines.
The development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines was a scientific triumph.
New partnerships involving governments, businesses, philanthropists, and multilateral institutions tested, delivered, and began administering vaccines in record time.
The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), a unique partnership between the World Health Organization and others, provides a multilateral framework for cooperation on diagnosis, treatments, and vaccines. The COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility, a key pillar in that partnership, has so far delivered a total of 40 million doses in over 100 countries.
Despite these achievements, vaccine inequality is widening by the day.
With 16% of the world’s population, high-income countries account for over half of confirmed vaccine orders, or around 4.6 billion doses – enough to vaccinate their populations several times over in some cases.
With twice the population share, the poorest developing countries have half the number of confirmed orders.
Current supplies to Sub-Saharan Africa cover less than 1% of the population. As wealthy countries immunize younger and healthier population groups, health workers in Mozambique, Nepal, and Bolivia are fighting the pandemic without protection – and lives are being lost.
The vaccine gap highlights a stark injustice.
While G7 countries are on track to achieve 70% coverage by the end of 2021, some of the poorest countries will not reach that level before 2024 on current trends.
This is ominously reminiscent of the initial response to the HIV/AIDS crisis, when Africa and other developing regions were left at the back of the queue for antiretroviral drugs that were widely available in rich countries.
The lag in delivery cost some 12 million lives.
Leaving the world’s poor behind in the race to vaccinate against COVID-19 represents a catastrophic moral failure.
It is also an act of devastating self-harm.
As the coronavirus spreads and mutates across unimmunized populations, it will pose a public health threat to people everywhere – including in the richest countries.
Moreover, the market disruption caused by low immunization rates in developing countries could cost the world economy $9.2 trillion, with advanced economies accounting for half the loss.
In short, there is an overwhelming ethical, epidemiological, and economic case for urgent collective action to achieve vaccine equity.
The more decisively we act as a single human community, the more lives will be saved, and the faster economies will recover.
The challenge is to ensure that sufficient vaccines are available and affordable to all countries.
We will not meet that challenge through voluntary donations alone, bilateral deals outside of COVAX, and the rampant vaccine nationalism that has characterized rich countries’ response so far.
This is a moment for bold action.
G7 countries must urgently scale up their support for ACT-A while supporting efforts to build vaccine self-reliance in developing countries.
To build effective global defenses against COVID-19 and future pandemic threats, we need equitable sharing of vaccines and open sharing of the know-how, information, and technology needed to develop complex manufacturing capabilities where they are needed.
Waiving intellectual property rights for the duration of the pandemic would help facilitate sharing, increase production, and drive down prices. The People’s Vaccine Alliance is mobilizing support for a waiver, and the South African and Indian governments have submitted proposals to the World Trade Organization.
What is missing is the financing plan needed to build on the foundations created by ACT-A.
The G7 summit can play a critical role here.
Political leaders should agree to finance a global plan aimed at achieving the vaccine ambitions of all countries by the end of this year, with everyone who wants a vaccine immunized by the end of 2022.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has set a goal of 60% coverage for the region by that date.
A G7 commitment of around $30 billion a year for the next two years, supplemented by wider measures to support vaccine self-reliance, would bring that goal within reach. It would also help close ACT-A’s current financing gap for this year of around $22 billion.
President Ramaphosa of South Africa and Norway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, have written to governments proposing a global financial burden-sharing arrangement based on countries’ relative economic weight.
We support that approach – and one of us (Brown) has proposed its adoption at the G7 summit.
Can the G7 countries afford the plan we propose?
We invite leaders to turn that question on its head: Can they afford not to make the investment?
The financing required is roughly equivalent to what G7 economies stand to lose every two weeks because of the trade dislocation resulting from limited vaccine access.
Moreover, equitable vaccination will pay for itself. The International Monetary Fund estimates that advanced economies stand to gain over $1 trillion in additional revenues from the boost to economic recovery delivered through accelerated global vaccination – a return of $16 for every $1 invested.
G7 governments have some ready-made financing mechanisms at their disposal.
They could agree to issue $10-15 billion in COVID-19 vaccine bonds channeled through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation.
Underwriting risk guarantees for COVID-19 financing provided through the World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions is another option.
With its triple-A credit rating protected, the Bank could mobilize $4-5 for every $1 provided in guarantees.
Given their status as major shareholders in the IMF and the World Bank, G7 governments should be more ambitious in leveraging both institutions’ resources for the COVID-19 response.
Low-income countries facing a lethal combination of reduced growth, unsustainable debt, and limited fiscal space urgently need financial support. The IMF recently estimated that an additional $200 billion is required for pandemic containment, including financing for health systems and vaccination programs.
With the United States having agreed in principle to a new $650 billion issue of special drawing rights (SDRs, the IMF’s reserve asset) – in effect, new international money – there is an opportunity to boost liquidity and narrow the financing gap.
G7 governments could agree to double the SDR allocation for low-income countries, a move that would generate $42 billion to fight the pandemic. They might also ask why more than 40 poor countries are still spending more on debt service than on health, and move to convert unpayable debt liabilities into life-saving vaccines.
Of course, finance is just one part of the equation. Governance also matters.
We must ensure that all governments – and civil society – have a voice in shaping international cooperation.
The World Health Assembly provides a multilateral platform for that voice – and it has a key role to play in achieving vaccine equity.
Benjamin Franklin famously warned the authors of America’s Declaration of Independence about the perils of division in the face of a powerful enemy.
“We must, indeed, all hang together,” he cautioned, “or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.”
Faced with this deadly pandemic, G7 leaders must now demonstrate global solidarity.
Their citizens’ safety and the world’s hopes depend on it.

The Anti-Hunger Imperative
BRUSSELS – There are plenty of summits to choose from this year, but the World Summit on Food Security deserves not to be lost in the crowd. This meeting in Rome from November 16-18 provides badly needed political momentum to three linked issues that rank among the most challenging of the current era: food security, biodiversity, and climate change.
Collectively, we are failing in the fight against world hunger.
More than one billion people in the world today do not have enough food to meet their basic daily nutritional needs, and the situation in developing countries is getting worse.
This is, first and foremost, a moral outrage. How can it be that in the twenty-first century, when we have taken men to the Moon and back, we still cannot feed everyone on this planet?
Policymakers must recognize, moreover, that food insecurity is linked to the lasting effects of the economic crisis and ongoing climate change, and that it represents no less a threat to our global community.
To be fair, world leaders have responded.
At the recent G-8 summit in L’Aquila, Italy, we made a firm commitment “to act with the scale and urgency needed to achieve global food security,” and we collectively pledged $20 billion over three years. This is a sizeable commitment, but it may not be enough – more needs to be done to increase agricultural production, to free up the potential of trade to address food insecurity, and to deal with the increasing impact of climate change on agriculture.
The European Commission, too, has responded, with finance for food security coming via a number of instruments. Our European Union food facility, agreed last year, is mobilizing an additional $1.5 billion for a rapid response to rising food prices.
And we will pump in another $4 billion in the coming three years to fund activities that help countries improve food security and adapt to climate change.
Extra money to address food security problems, among other things, should be one of the key outcomes of the finance package that the EU strongly supports for the next crucial event on the summit calendar: the Copenhagen climate conference in December.
Changing weather patterns and the increasing magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events will require substantial investments if farmers are to adapt successfully. These changes hit the poorest the hardest, and global trends mask deep regional disparities.
Small farmers, predominantly in developing countries, will bear the brunt of climate change.
If we do not act quickly, the 40 poorest countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, will by 2080 lose from 10% to 20% of their basic grain-growing capacity due to drought.
But answers to this problem are close to hand.
The impact of biodiversity is often insufficiently understood, which means that we have undervalued its contribution to tackling global challenges.
The more diverse the variation of life forms within a given ecosystem, the more resilient it is to change.
So biodiversity can act as a natural “insurance policy” against sudden environmental changes and a buffer against losses caused by them (as well as by pests and diseases).
Biodiversity is essential for reliable and stable long-term food production. The famines in Ireland in the nineteenth century and in Ethiopia in the late twentieth century provide clear evidence of the vulnerability of undiversified crops to environmental changes, and the dramatic consequences of such vulnerability for the population.
Crop diversity can also deliver important ecosystem benefits. Varieties that are tolerant to drought and flood can not only increase productivity, but also can prevent soil erosion and desertification.
In southern Ghana, for example, farmers have managed to reduce crop failures arising from rainfall variability and unpredictability by cultivating several drought-tolerant types of the same crop species.
In addition, crop diversification has reduced the need for costly and environmentally damaging pesticides.
So I am convinced that we should raise the profile of biodiversity in tackling climate change and food insecurity, and that we need more high-level attention to this subject.
Next week, when leaders meet in Rome, I hope that we will agree on the key priorities to fight hunger and food insecurity, and in particular to establish an authoritative source of advice on food security to governments and international institutions.
In fact, we need for food security what the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel has done for climate change: a science-based red-alert system for the planet. And at the start of a new five-year term at the European Commission, I will continue to do all I can to promote this important issue.
But even the best and most up-to-date donor policies will remain vain exercises if governments in developed countries fail to translate their commitments into hard cash and improvements in agricultural investment worldwide.
So finally let the World Summit on Food Security provide tangible evidence of a commitment from all governments to a common objective: a world free of hunger.
History will judge us unfavorably if we fail.

Tipping the Scales in Myanmar’s Civil War
BANGKOK – Conflicts within and between countries take many forms, but they are always about power. That is as true for the brutal military coup that toppled Myanmar’s elected government two years ago as it is for Russia’s war against Ukraine.
But while Ukraine’s plight has dominated world headlines and attracted billions of dollars in military equipment and other assistance, Myanmar’s subjugation from within has gone largely unnoticed by outsiders, and the civilian opposition has received little support.
To be sure, Southeast Asia is a coup-prone region.
Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines all endured “coup eras” before settling on roughly democratic trajectories, albeit with autocratic characteristics.
Thailand has endured two putsches since 2006, and has yet to achieve a political bargain that can break the military and monarchy’s joint hold on power.
But Myanmar tops the lot.
Its generals seized power in 1962.
While direct military rule eventually gave way to constitutional dictatorship, it was not until 2011 that the military junta was officially dissolved and a nominally civilian government established.
Even then, however, the miliary, under General Thein Sein’s leadership, retained key levers of power.
During the ensuing decade, Myanmar experienced political liberalization, economic reform, and real progress on development.
As foreign investment poured in, businesses flourished, and embassies were established, the country seemed increasingly eager to leave military rule in the past.
Consecutive elections – in 2015 and 2020 – boosted civilian power, as Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) secured landslide victories over the military’s Union Solidarity and Development Party.
After languishing for decades in dictatorship and despair, Myanmar’s ethnically diverse society – especially its younger cohort – saw the glimmer of a more prosperous, democratic future.
But their hopes were dashed in February 2021 – less than three months after the country’s last election – when the commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces, Min Aung Hlaing, staged a new coup.
But, this time, Myanmar’s people did not acquiesce.
Immediately after the coup, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest the military takeover.
As the months went on, the military junta blacked out the internet, declared martial law, and initiated a violent security crackdown: the regime has reportedly killed nearly 3,000 civilians and arrested nearly 17,000.
But the people continued to resist.
Within days of the coup, the protesters joined forces with a committee representing the NLD members of parliament who had been elected in the previous election. This led to the formation, in April, of the National Unity Government (NUG), which includes members of the NLD, other parties, and independents.
Working in tandem with the National Unity Consultative Council, the NUG promotes a vision of an inclusive, civilian-led government that serves the Bamar majority and ethnic minorities alike.
Meanwhile, Myanmar’s ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), particularly the Karens near the border with Thailand and the Kachins in the north, began pursuing open combat operations against Myanmar’s battle-hardened military.
Then, in May, the NUG’s armed wing, the People’s Defense Force, was formed – a remarkable display of defiance by Myanmar’s young people, who form the majority of the PDF’s local militias.
Unwilling to give up the freedom that was denied to their forebears, they took up rudimentary, often homemade arms and began, together with the EAOs, to fight.
Despite no central command structure or international support, the ragtag PDF militias have become increasingly coordinated and skillful in their use of guerrilla-style tactics, and have begun carrying out targeted assassinations.
And, given widespread support for their cause, their ranks are growing.
The EAOs, for their part, are carrying on the fight in their enclaves.
Myanmar’s military still has the advantage in terms of armor, artillery, and airpower.
But the determined resistance that Myanmar’s people have mounted has prevented the junta from gaining full power over the country, roughly half of which is currently controlled by the opposition alliance.
While the military can generate enough cash to sustain its patchy rule by selling natural resources, Myanmar’s civil war has become a stalemate.
So far, the international community has done little to help Myanmar’s people, even as they have endured a humanitarian crisis that recalls the country’s darkest days of dictatorship.
Yes, sanctions have been imposed and condemnations issued.
But China backs the junta, to which Russia supplies arms.
Even the Association of Southeast Asian Nations – which includes Myanmar – has been ineffectual and done little to bring about peaceful dialogue.
Rather than remaining effectively complicit in the junta’s crimes against its own people, the international community should recognize the NUG, which has proved itself to be a viable government, able to provide political direction and raise revenue from both domestic supporters and the diaspora.
Given that the civil war will ultimately be won and lost on the battlefield, it also means arming the opposition with defensive weapons, particularly portable anti-aircraft capabilities, which would neutralize the punishing airstrikes that have often claimed civilian lives.
Myanmar’s people are putting their lives on the line to take back a future stolen from them by a heinous regime.
They deserve the international community’s support, just as Ukraine’s defenders do.

Rebalancing the Eurozone
WASHINGTON, DC – The eurozone crisis unfolded primarily as a sovereign-debt crisis mostly on its southern periphery, with interest rates on sovereign bonds at times reaching 6-7% for Italy and Spain, and even higher for other countries.
And, because eurozone banks hold a substantial part of their assets in the form of eurozone sovereign bonds, the sovereign-debt crisis became a potential banking crisis, worsened by banks’ other losses, owing, for example, to the collapse of housing prices in Spain.
So a key challenge in resolving the eurozone crisis is to reduce the southern countries’ debt burdens.
The change in a country’s debt burden reflects the size of its primary budget balance (the balance minus interest payments) as a share of GDP, as well as the difference between its borrowing costs and its GDP growth rate.
When the difference between borrowing costs and growth becomes too large, the primary budget surpluses required to stop debt from increasing become impossible to achieve.
Indeed, growth in southern Europe is expected to be close to zero or negative for the next two years, and is not expected to exceed 2-3% even in the longer term.
While not always evident from the headlines, an underlying cause of the eurozone crisis – and now an obstacle for growth in the south – has been the divergence in production costs that developed between the peripheral countries, notably the “south” (specifically, Greece, Spain, Italy, and Portugal) and the “north” (for simplicity, Germany) during the first decade after the introduction of the euro.
Unit labor costs in the four southern countries increased by 36%, 28%, 30%, and 25%, respectively, from 2000 to 2010, compared to less than 5% in Germany, resulting in an end-2010 cumulative divergence above 30% in Greece and more than 20% in Portugal, Italy, and Spain.
Unit labor costs reflect compensation levels and productivity: gains in productivity can offset the effect of wage growth.
Productivity performance did not vary dramatically between northern and southern European countries from 2000 to 2010 – in fact, average annual productivity growth was faster in Greece than in Germany (1% versus 0.7%). But labor costs increased much faster in the south, resulting in differential cost increases that cannot be addressed by devaluation as long as the monetary union endures.
As long as this internal divergence persists, the euro crisis cannot be fully resolved, because current-account deficits and/or slow growth will continue to stalk the southern European countries, perpetuating worries about sovereign debt and commercial banks.
In this context, productivity growth �� whether through technical progress, better allocation of resources, or productive investment – is as important a variable for the southern economies as wage restraint is. Indeed, excessive wage deflation is likely to have negative effects on productivity.
Skilled labor is likely to emigrate faster, and extreme austerity, falling prices, and high unemployment – and the resulting likelihood of social tension – are not exactly conducive to investment, innovation, or labor mobility.
Likewise, while reducing employment is one way to boost productivity, it implies high macroeconomic costs in terms of lost revenues and higher social spending.
Perhaps even more importantly, economic policy should not break a society’s confidence in itself; what economists call “animal spirits” must be able to reflect hope for the future.
For all of these reasons, excessive austerity and deflation could defeat its own purpose and make the “reforms” to improve the southern European countries’ competitiveness impossible to implement.
The right approach must combine reasonable wage restraint and low (but not negative) inflation with microeconomic policy measures aimed at encouraging productivity increases.
Moreover, it is clear that northern European countries could help to close the competitiveness gap more rapidly by encouraging faster wage growth.
Indeed, Western policy-makers’ strong focus on persuading the Chinese authorities to permit greater appreciation of their currency is puzzling when one considers that Germany’s current-account surplus, as a share of GDP, is now much larger than China’s.
Reversing the large differential in unit labor costs that has emerged in the euro’s first decade thus requires not only wage restraint and productivity-enhancing reforms in the south, but also higher wage gains in the north. A simulation shows that if German wages grew at 4% annually instead of the 1.5% of the last decade, and if annual productivity growth in Spain accelerated to 2% (it was close to 0.7% in both countries), Spain could reverse the unit-labor-cost differential that emerged with Germany since 2000 in five years, with Spanish wages growing at about 1.7% per annum.
This should not be an impossible scenario.
It would require restraint in Spain, where wages grew at an average annual rate of 3.4% in 2000-2010, as well as a serious effort to accelerate productivity growth.
But it would not require falling wages or significant price deflation: annual wage growth of 1.7% and productivity growth of 2% would be compatible with inflation close to zero.
Productivity growth at the historical rate of 0.7% in Germany, with wage growth of 4%, would be compatible with an inflation rate a little above 3%.
In short, internal adjustment in the eurozone is achievable without serious deflation in the south, provided that productivity growth there accelerates, and that the north does its part by encouraging modestly faster wage gains. The smaller current-account surplus in northern Europe that might result from this should itself be welcome.
If the north insists on maintaining the low wage growth of the 2000-2010 period, internal adjustment would require significant unemployment and deflation in the south, making it more difficult and perhaps politically impossible to achieve.

Truth and De-Trumpification
BERLIN – Among Democrats and many Republicans, there is a great temptation to dismiss US President Donald Trump’s administration as a bizarre aberration.
Just as Republicans may try to blame the many transgressions of the past four years on Trump, hoping that their enabling role is quickly forgotten, Democrats might want to make a show of observing democratic norms, by graciously refraining from litigating the past. If so, should Joe Biden prevail when all votes in the November 3 election are counted, Trump and his administration are unlikely to be held accountable for their egregious record of corruption, cruelty, and violations of basic constitutional principles.
Quite apart from political calculations, many observers – from former Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang to distinguished jurists and historians – have argued that only tin-pot dictatorships pursue their vanquished opponents.
With all-too-obvious motives of his own, US Attorney General Bill Barr has also opined that “the political winners ritually prosecuting the political losers is not the stuff of a mature democracy.”
Yet these generalizations are too hasty.
Trump’s “lock her up” slogan, directed against Hillary Clinton in 2016, should not be answered with “lock him up”; but “forgive and forget” is not the only alternative.
Americans need to distinguish among three issues: crimes Trump may have committed before assuming office; corruption and cruelty committed by him and his cronies while in office; and behavior that has exposed structural weaknesses within the broader US political system.
Each requires a somewhat different response.
Historically, plenty of other countries’ transitions from authoritarianism – or recovery from democratic degradation – have been characterized by a willingness to leave former power-holders unpunished. As the political scientist Erica Frantz observes, 59% of authoritarian leaders who have been removed from power have simply gone “on to live their normal lives.”
Nonetheless, in cases where new or restored democracies did not prosecute former officials, they often established truth commissions, offering amnesty in exchange for truthful information and confessions by the perpetrators of crimes.
This approach was most famously pursued by post-apartheid South Africa.
The peculiarity of the current US situation is that Trump is already under investigation for possible crimes unrelated to his presidency.
Both the Manhattan district attorney and the New York attorney general are investigating the Trump Organization for various forms of fraud.
While ostensibly apolitical, Trump’s business practices foreshowed – and overshadowed – the shameless cronyism and corruption of his presidency.
Even if he did not succeed in fully transforming the United States into a mafia state along the lines of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, that is largely beside the point.
Moreover, if the investigations into the Trump Organization were simply to be dropped upon his departure from office, the charge that they were mere political machinations would appear to be justified, especially considering that the law-enforcement officials in question happen to be Democrats.
On the other hand, if the investigations were to result in the incarceration of a former president, Trump’s gun-toting supporters might decide to take the law into their own hands; at a minimum, the country’s political divisions would deepen even further.
Bearing these risks in mind, there is no reason, in principle, why a political leader cannot be properly punished for a crime he has committed.
Many leaders have been, and some have even returned to political life.
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was forced to perform community service following his conviction on charges of tax fraud (his age brought a more lenient sentence).
Today, he is sitting in the European Parliament, which makes it hard for anyone to claim that liberal judges simply wanted to silence the Cavaliere. But the point of enforcing the law was to send a clear signal that Berlusconi’s strategy of entering politics in order to gain immunity and distract from his shady business dealings would not become a precedent.
Then there is the question of Trump’s actual record in office.
One can find plenty of deeply objectionable policies, but it would be a mistake to abandon what President Thomas Jefferson, upon succeeding his archrival John Adams in 1801, called “the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it.”
The same cannot be said for the corruption and systematic cruelty that the Trump administration has exhibited in its response to the COVID-19 crisis, and in separating children from their parents at the border.
As the Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet has suggested, a commission of inquiry should be established to investigate policies and acts that went beyond incompetence into the realm of politically motivated malevolence.
It is critical that we establish a proper record of these events, perhaps by offering leniency in exchange for candid accounts. The latter should help thinking about structural reforms, making at least quid pro quo corruption and blatant human-rights abuses less likely.
Finally, Trump has broken plenty of informal presidential norms, from the relatively trivial – calling people names on Twitter – to the serious: hiding his tax returns.
As many US jurists have argued, a prudent response would be to establish a separate commission to study the structural vulnerabilities of the presidency.
Such an investigation may find that many informal norms – from financial transparency to relations with the Department of Justice – need to be codified.
There would be nothing vengeful about this particular approach.
After Watergate, Congress enacted a series of important ethics laws, which both parties tended to accept.
This three-pronged approach need not distract from more urgent tasks of governance.
Although it might require spending some political capital, the costs of inaction or breezily “moving on” could be even higher, as was arguably the case following Gerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon (who never really did admit any guilt), and the leniency shown after the Iran-Contra scandal and the George W. Bush administration’s extensive use of torture in pursuing its “global war on terror.”
To be sure, plenty of Republicans might fight truth-seeking efforts tooth and nail.
But others could use a public inquiry focused on improving US institutions to distance themselves from Trump.
After all, they have already shown themselves to be nothing if not opportunistic.

A Scientific Outlook for a Post-Factual World
VIENNA – We have entered a disturbing new era.
The sheer volume of false utterances and outright lies spewed during the United States’ presidential election campaign implies a growing disdain for factual knowledge, as does the proliferation of fake news disseminated without journalistic filters on social-media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
By the time of the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum in June, experts had already been deemed dispensable.
With elites everywhere being accused of neglecting “real” people, frustration and anger are now trumping fact-based deliberation.
In a climate of anxiety, confusion, and nostalgia for a fantastical past, raw emotion prevails.
The rules of public discourse become obsolete, and the open horizon of possible futures is narrowed to a single escape route that fear-mongers portray as the only way forward.
This is a poor way to cope with uncertainty, and it stands in striking contrast to the methods of science and free inquiry.
In science, uncertainty is a powerful incentive for acquiring knowledge; indeed, it is the primary motivation for research, which is inherently uncertain.
New discoveries often occur during open-ended explorations of the unknown.
Scientists conducting fundamental research cannot predict what they will find or when they will find it.
Many important discoveries are a result of serendipity: researchers find something unexpected that they were not looking for, but which they quickly recognize as significant.
The scientific community rigorously seeks consensus about knowledge produced so far, but it knows that there is still much more to be discovered.
All scientific knowledge is therefore preliminary, and will be extended, complemented, or replaced by new knowledge.
At the same time, science and technology have enabled us to anticipate risks and identify additional unknowns.
So, the more we know, the more we comprehend what we do not know.
But, whereas the scientific community embraces uncertainty, remains ever curious, and is confident about the power of science and technology to create new opportunities for mankind’s collective future, other segments of society do not necessarily share this outlook.
And it behooves scientists to understand why.
There can be a fine line between experts’ prerogative to make technical judgments and non-experts’ prerogative to assess the consequences of those judgments.
But between these positions lies a vast range of unintended consequences.
When people translate knowledge into action, they initiate new interactions within complex systems, without necessarily knowing what the final consequences of those actions will be.
Humans have evolved to understand simple cause-and-effect relationships.
What we need now are more refined mathematical tools and simulation models to understand the hidden uncertainties that can emerge from interactions in complex social and natural systems.
Likewise, humans have evolved to crave certainty.
Past civilizations adopted divinatory practices in an effort to know the future.
But, since then, humanity has made impressive strides away from believing in a predetermined destiny, and toward actively shaping the human condition.
Science and technology were crucial to this progress, but they were not sufficient.
We also needed new ideas about the scope of human agency.
Encouraged by the achievements of modern science, we came to perceive the future as being radically open.
Even though path dependencies, incomplete information, and cognitive biases can still frustrate human actions, we need no longer assume that past experiences must determine future outcomes.
The future is inherently uncertain, which means that the present always could have turned out different than it has.
Uncertainty is a cunning force in nature and lived experience.
Its logic is always at work as we encounter constantly changing circumstances.
It evolves and manifests itself in different ways: sometimes it challenges our assumptions and subverts our expectations; often, it takes us by surprise.
Because of uncertainty, our achievements are not always what we intended them to be, and our lives are never simply routine.
Uncertainty reveals opportunities to us that otherwise would have been wasted.
Our lives are probabilistic, not determined, and the more we realize this, the less we need to feel threatened by uncertainty.
Still, there is widespread disaffection today, and clever politicians are eager to exploit citizens’ anger.
If people feel engulfed by crises, and view the future as fragile and precarious, they will be reluctant to embrace uncertainty.
But this is where science has something to offer.
Science makes visible that which would otherwise remain hidden.
It alerts us to randomness in the physical and social world, and to the role that uncertainty plays in our communities and personal lives.
By revealing the messiness of the world that we have created – intentionally and unintentionally – it allows us to imagine how we can create that world anew, even as we accept that the future will remain open and uncertain.

Overcoming the Copenhagen Failure
NEW YORK – Pretty speeches can take you only so far.
A month after the Copenhagen climate conference, it is clear that the world’s leaders were unable to translate rhetoric about global warming into action.
It was, of course, nice that world leaders could agree that it would be bad to risk the devastation that could be wrought by an increase in global temperatures of more than two degrees Celsius.
At least they paid some attention to the mounting scientific evidence. And certain principles set out in the 1992 Rio Framework Convention, including “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,” were affirmed.
So, too, was the developed countries’ agreement to “provide adequate, predictable and sustainable financial resources, technology, and capacity-building….” to developing countries.
The failure of Copenhagen was not the absence of a legally binding agreement.
The real failure was that there was no agreement about how to achieve the lofty goal of saving the planet, no agreement about reductions in carbon emissions, no agreement on how to share the burden, and no agreement on help for developing countries. Even the commitment of the accord to provide amounts approaching $30 billion for the period 2010-2012 for adaptation and mitigation appears paltry next to the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been doled out to the banks in the bailouts of 2008-2009.
If we can afford that much to save banks, we can afford something more to save the planet.
The consequences of the failure are already apparent: the price of emission rights in the European Union Emission Trading System has fallen, which means that firms will have less incentive to reduce emissions now and less incentive to invest in innovations that will reduce emissions in the future. Firms that wanted to do the right thing, to spend the money to reduce their emissions, now worry that doing so would put them at a competitive disadvantage as others continue to emit without restraint.
European firms will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage relative to American firms, which bear no cost for their emissions.
Underlying the failure in Copenhagen are some deep problems.
The Kyoto approach allocated emission rights, which are a valuable asset.
If emissions were appropriately restricted, the value of emission rights would be a couple trillion dollars a year – no wonder that there is a squabble over who should get them.
Clearly, the idea that those who emitted more in the past should get more emission rights for the future is unacceptable.
The “minimally” fair allocation to the developing countries requires equal emission rights per capita.
Most ethical principles would suggest that, if one is distributing what amounts to “money” around the world, one should give more (per capita) to the poor.
So, too, most ethical principles would suggest that those that have polluted more in the past – especially after the problem was recognized in 1992 – should have less right to pollute in the future. But such an allocation would implicitly transfer hundreds of billions of dollars from rich to poor.
Given the difficulty of coming up with even $10 billion a year – let alone the $200 billion a year that is needed for mitigation and adaptation – it is wishful thinking to expect an agreement along these lines.
Perhaps it is time to try another approach: a commitment by each country to raise the price of emissions (whether through a carbon tax or emissions caps) to an agreed level, say, $80 per ton. Countries could use the revenues as an alternative to other taxes – it makes much more sense to tax bad things than good things.
Developed countries could use some of the revenues generated to fulfill their obligations to help the developing countries in terms of adaptation and to compensate them for maintaining forests, which provide a global public good through carbon sequestration.
We have seen that goodwill alone can get us only so far.
We must now conjoin self-interest with good intentions, especially because leaders in some countries (particularly the United States) seem afraid of competition from emerging markets even without any advantage they might receive from not having to pay for carbon emissions . A system of border taxes – imposed on imports from countries where firms do not have to pay appropriately for carbon emissions – would level the playing field and provide economic and political incentives for countries to adopt a carbon tax or emission caps.
That, in turn, would provide economic incentives for firms to reduce their emissions.
Time is of the essence.
While the world dawdles, greenhouse gases are building up in the atmosphere, and the likelihood that the world will meet even the agreed-upon target of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius is diminishing.
We have given the Kyoto approach, based on emission rights, more than a fair chance.
Given the fundamental problems underlying it, Copenhagen’s failure should not be a surprise.
At the very least, it is worth giving the alternative a chance.

Financial Gain, Economic Pain
NEW YORK – In the past three months, global asset prices have rebounded sharply: stock prices have increased by more than 30% in advanced economies, and by much more in most emerging markets.
Prices of commodities – oil, energy, and minerals – have soared; corporate credit spreads (the difference between the yield of corporate and government bonds) have narrowed dramatically, as government-bond yields have increased sharply; volatility (the “fear gauge”) has fallen; and the dollar has weakened, as demand for safe dollar assets has abated.
But is the recovery of asset prices driven by economic fundamentals?
Is it sustainable?
Is the recovery in stock prices another bear-market rally or the beginning of a bullish trend?
While economic data suggests that improvement in fundamentals has occurred - the risk of a near depression has been reduced; the prospects of the global recession bottoming out by year end are increasing; and risk sentiment is improving - it is equally clear that other, less sustainable factors are also playing a role.
Moreover, the sharp rise in some asset prices threatens the recovery of a global economy that has not yet hit bottom.
Indeed, many risks of a downward market correction remain.
First, confidence and risk aversion are fickle, and bouts of renewed volatility may occur if macroeconomic and financial data were to surprise on the downside – as they may if a near-term and robust global recovery (which many people expect) does not materialize.
Second, extremely loose monetary policies (zero interest rates, quantitative easing, new credit facilities, emissions of government bonds, and purchases of illiquid and risky private assets), together with the huge sums spent to stabilize the financial system, may be causing a new liquidity-driven asset bubble in financial and commodity markets. For example, Chinese state-owned enterprises that gained access to huge amounts of easy money and credit are buying equities and stockpiling commodities well beyond their productive needs.
The risk of a correction in the face of disappointing macroeconomic fundamentals is clear. Indeed, recent data from the United States and other advanced economies suggest that the recession may last through the end of the year.
Worse, the recovery is likely to be anemic and sub-par – well below potential for a couple of years, if not longer – as the burden of debts and leverage of the private sector combine with rising public sector debts to limit the ability of households, financial firms, and corporations to lend, borrow, spend, consume, and invest.
This more challenging scenario of anemic recovery undermines hopes for a V-shaped recovery, as low growth and deflationary pressures constrain earnings and profit margins, and as unemployment rates above 10% in most advanced economies cause financial shocks to re-emerge, owing to mounting losses for banks’ and financial institutions’ portfolios of loans and toxic assets. At the same time, financial crises in a number of emerging markets could prove contagious, placing additional stress on global financial markets.
The increase in some asset prices may, moreover, lead to a W-shaped double-dip recession.
In particular, thanks to massive liquidity, energy prices are now rising too high too soon.
The role that high oil prices played in the summer of 2008 in tipping the global economy into recession should not be underestimated.
Oil above $140 a barrel was the last straw – coming on top of the housing busts and financial shocks – for the global economy, as it represented a massive supply shock for the US, Europe, Japan, China and other net importers of oil.
Meanwhile, rising fiscal deficits in most economies are now pushing up the yields of long-term government bonds.
Some of the rise in long rates is a necessary correction, as investors are now pricing a global recovery. But some of this increase is driven by more worrisome factors: the effects of large budget deficits and debt on sovereign risk, and thus on real interest rates; and concerns that the incentive to monetize these large deficits will lead to high inflation after the global economy recovers in 2010-11 and deflationary forces abate.
The crowding out of private demand, owing to higher government-bond yields – and the ensuing increase in mortgage rates and other private yields – could, in turn, endanger the recovery.
As a result, one cannot rule out that by late 2010 or 2011, a perfect storm of oil above $100 a barrel, rising government-bond yields, and tax increases (as governments seek to avoid debt-refinancing risks) may lead to a renewed growth slowdown, if not an outright double-dip recession.
The recent recovery of asset prices from their March lows is in part justified by fundamentals, as the risks of global financial meltdown and depression have fallen and confidence has improved. But much of the rise is not justified, as it is driven by excessively optimistic expectations of a rapid recovery of growth towards its potential level, and by a liquidity bubble that is raising oil prices and equities too fast too soon.
A negative oil shock, together with rising government-bond yields – could clip the recovery’s wings and lead to a significant further downturn in asset prices and in the real economy.

After Dictatorship
The war in Iraq had barely begun when the minds of those who conceived the invasion turned to what should happen after the victory over Saddam Hussein's regime-a victory everyone assumed to be inevitable.
Politicians and experts have invariably sought to draw comparisons with recent examples like Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, East Timor, but also with more remote and fundamental cases.
After all, what is expected in Iraq is the fall of a highly ideological dictatorship.
Is there anything we can learn from the last examples of this kind, from the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, or the end of the Third Reich in Germany in 1945 and the process of "de-Nazification" that followed?
The risks of such comparisons are almost too obvious for words.
Every case has its own defining features.
Regarding the demise of communism, the experiences of, say, Poland and Romania are profoundly different.
As we cross even more profound cultural boundaries, comparisons become still less relevant.
Yet there are a few issues that are common to the unraveling of most ideological dictatorships.
One such issue has to do with memory, and dealing with the past.
This is connected with a practical question: who is in a position to build a new country on the ruins of the old regime?
It is rare for a counter-elite to emerge quickly, much less for an elite-in-waiting to take over.
In Germany in the 1950s, there were many complaints about old Nazis reappearing in a democratic guise and occupying important positions.
Many of us fought against the apparent "restoration" of the old regime.
In Eastern Europe, the old leaders initially disappeared from the scene, but not for long.
Ex-communists were often reincarnated politically as social democrats.
Those who had been in the resistance-like Václav Havel in Prague-found this hard to take.
Yet these communist apparatchiks were not the same people they had been.
Circumstances had changed and the people with them.
This has a great deal to do with methods of dealing with the past.
Post-1945 Germany and post-1989 Poland are examples of countries that moved forward without much attention to the past.
Intellectuals complained that too little time and energy was spent on "mastering" the past.
They had good reasons to complain.
Indeed, after a decade or so, the need to draw clear lines and tell all, including the painful stories, became overwhelming.
But the most successful postcommunist countries moved forward first and coped with the past later.
Those who could not lift their eyes from the horrors of the past made less progress.
A second general issue has to do with priorities.
There is a natural tendency-especially in Anglo-Saxon countries-to regard elections as the most effective institutional remedy for countries emerging from ideological dictatorships.
To be sure, elections are important; but by themselves they do not solve problems.
Indeed, if they disappoint, the very principles on which they are based-democracy and civil liberties-will be discredited.
I am a strong, almost old-fashioned believer in parliamentary democracy, but when it comes to situations like postwar Iraq, two other imperatives are equally pressing.
One is the need to establish an effective administration to make certain that new policies of tolerance and market economics are actually implemented. In East European countries, this was a major problem, and it is only through accession negotiations with the European Union that such administrative reform has been assured.
The second imperative is the rule of law.
The law has a different place in different cultures, and it presents special problems in Islamic countries.
However, it is crucial that every effort be made to educate and install an impartial and incorruptible judiciary.
Judges must not only be honest, but must be seen to be so and, as such, trusted.
The process of establishing the rule of law has been difficult and has remained incomplete in most post-dictatorial countries; yet it will be a key to successful recovery in Iraq as well.
One of the key points that I emphasized in my 1990 book Reflections on the Revolution in Europe is also valid for Iraq.
The road from the collapse of a dictatorial regime backed by ideology to a more liberal order leads through a valley of tears.
Things are likely to get worse before they get better.
This is notably the case in economic terms.
Even post-War Germany's acclaimed, miracle-working Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, was deeply unpopular in the early 1950s, because it appeared as if only a few were getting rich, while most West Germans remained poor or got poorer.
For a certain period in the process of recovery, it is simply necessary for people to keep their nerve.
Poland is a recent example of a country that achieved this feat.
It requires plausible leadership and the reasonable hope that things will get better before long.
If this time of transition goes wrong, the alternative is renewed turmoil and the victory of fundamentalists of one kind or another.
The warning "Beware of the valley of tears!" is thus the one that must be taken most seriously by those responsible for rebuilding an Iraq scarred by the terrors of dictatorship and the ravages of war.

Iran’s Conservative Tightrope
BLACKSBURG, VIRGINIA – The massive public protests that have raged across Iran since 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the morality police in September arrived at the World Cup.
Ahead of its 6-2 loss to England last month, the Iranian team refused to sing the Islamic Republic’s national anthem, with some activists in attendance waving protest signs and booing the team for not quitting the tournament altogether in a show of solidarity toward the hundreds of young Iranians killed during the past ten weeks.
Football is by far Iran’s favorite sport.
So, for Iranians to turn against their national team, especially one that had topped the Asian qualifiers, speaks to the deep wound that the protests have etched on the country’s psyche.
As the movement has grown and protests spread from Tehran to the provinces, protesters have broadened their demands. Their call for an end to harassment by the morality police soon hardened into chants of “death to the dictator,” referring to 83-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
To be sure, this crisis does not appear to threaten the regime’s survival.
The protesters lack the means to overthrow the government, and the leadership is unlikely to splinter.
Fortunately for the regime, its external enemies are helping it keep its different factions united.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Israel’s former and likely future prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, both supporters of the protests, are probably the two most reviled figures in Iran.
And the United States has a poor record of fostering regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, leaving behind failed or deeply destabilized states.
But the Islamic Republic’s harsh crackdown on protesters has severed the government’s ties to several generations of Iranians, not only young people.
Their parents’ generation had been largely loyal to the revolution; in their own youth, middle-aged Iranians sought to reform the system from within rather than overthrow it.
They elected politicians who promised not just material benefits but also greater tolerance toward different lifestyles.
Over the past two decades, Iranian reformists have tried with limited success to make the Islamic Republic more tolerant. Former President Mohammad Khatami, elected in 1997, pushed for “dialogue among civilizations” until he stepped down in 2005.
President Hassan Rouhani, who served from 2013 until 2021, promised more moderate social policies, as well as repairing relations with the West and bringing an end to economic sanctions.
Even former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, elected as a hardliner in 2005, later turned against his conservative benefactors and adopted his own style of reformism.
Since leaving office in 2013, he has campaigned for greater individual liberties and abolition of the morality police (a step the regime has now taken).
In 2021, frustrated hardliners engineered the election of a deeply conservative cleric, current President Ebrahim Raisi, whose task would be to demonstrate to the public what true Islamic revolutionaries could deliver.
A uniformly traditionalist government, the hardliners hoped, would deliver economic prosperity at home and cement Iran’s position as a regional power, turning Iranians away from reform and rapprochement with the West.
When prosperity failed to materialize, the hardliners blamed Iran’s poor economic performance on Western sanctions, neoliberal policies introduced by previous governments, and over-reliance on globalized markets.
Some even blamed the ineffectual 2015 nuclear deal for the country’s economic ills.
Raisi, who won the presidency with only 18 million votes (out of an electorate of 59 million), lacks the mandate and the experience to deliver on his promises to reach a deal with the West, tame inflation, and stop the depreciation of the currency.
It follows, then, that Iranian conservatives were unprepared when the protests erupted.
Tensions between young women and the authorities over forced hijab wearing have been bubbling for years, but conservatives paid little attention. In fact, hardliners had been pushing for increased surveillance of women in public spaces since 2019, before Raisi’s election.
Many thought it was time to reverse the lax enforcement of the 1983 hijab law that criminalized female attire deemed “un-Islamic.”
That doing so was inconsistent with the changing times, and that the dress code had already sparked protracted anti-hijab protests in Iran’s more affluent urban neighborhoods, did not seem to trigger alarm bells.
What the regime missed is that Iranian society has changed since 1983, when most women observed the hijab law willingly.
Many women lived very different lives back then; they experienced 6-8 pregnancies on average, did not seek work outside the home, and were not as highly educated.
The pro-poor policies of the early Islamic revolutionaries provided electricity, clean water, and health services to rural and poor urban areas, transforming many women’s lives.
Today, however, women in Iran marry in their mid-to-late twenties and have two children on average. Thirty-eight percent of Iranian women in their twenties have at least some higher education, compared to 33% of men in their age cohort.
To them, the mere thought that they could be arrested and dragged to a re-education camp by the morality police is intolerable.
To his credit, Raisi, who promised to create a million jobs and a million new homes every year during his four-year term, has mainly focused on realizing his ambitious economic goals.
But during his first year in office, the economy added only 374,000 jobs.
We do not have data on how many new homes were built during this time, but it seems safe to assume that it was far fewer than a million.
A decade of economic failures has stoked even more anger among Iran’s youth.
Young Iranians graduating from college wait more than 2.5 years on average before landing their first job.
In 2021, almost half of college-educated women in their twenties and a quarter of their male peers were unemployed.
Most Iranians in their late twenties still live with their parents, financially unable to start a family of their own.
In trying to quell popular unrest, the authorities will likely find it was much easier to abolish the hated morality police than it will be to bring about robust economic growth.
Given Iran’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, reviving the nuclear deal seems all but impossible, as does the prospect of Iran rejoining the global economy anytime soon.

The ECB’s Political Overreach
FRANKFURT – In mid-June, as the yield on Italian ten-year bonds was rising to around 250 basis points above that of German bonds, the European Central Bank felt it necessary to hold a special Governing Council meeting to announce accelerating work on a new “anti-fragmentation” measure.
And now, it has unveiled the fruit of its effort.
The ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument is supposed to “ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries,” according to the official announcement.
“The TPI will be an addition to [our] toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.”
The TPI is an ambitious and risky undertaking for the ECB, considering how difficult it is to determine the extent to which spreads (the difference between different countries’ bond yields) reflect differences in underlying fundamentals, as opposed to unjustified and destabilizing market dynamics. Moreover, there will always be a significant political element in such judgment calls, which ensures that they will be tested by markets.
As a result, the ECB inevitably will feel greater pressure to intervene more strongly than is justified by the economic and financial fundamentals of the country concerned.
To decide if market risk premia are justified by fundamentals, the ECB Governing Council ultimately must offer an opinion about whether a member state’s future economic, financial, and social policy decisions will be sound. But it is not the task of an independent central bank to make extensive judgments about future government policies, nor to fine-tune individual countries’ funding costs with policies that have potentially far-reaching political consequences.
The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program invited the same basic objection.
Maintaining eurozone cohesion is primarily the responsibility of national governments, which must ensure that their policy decisions comply with the conditions of a stability-oriented monetary union.
The job of supporting a crisis-afflicted member state belongs not to the central bank but to the community of member-state governments.
But the OMT at least has some important advantages over the TPI, starting with the conditions that it imposes on member states that seek support.
Conditionality is crucial to prevent the central bank from becoming an engine of monetary financing.
As then-ECB President Mario Draghi explained in a May 6, 2013, speech:
“The bond-issuing governments which request the activation of OMTs agree, in conjunction with the European authorities and, if possible, with the International Monetary Fund, on a recovery program to address macroeconomic and structural weaknesses.
This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition … The conditionality associated with the program to which governments and the European authorities agree is a crucial element in being able to preserve monetary policy independence. It is important in providing the ECB with adequate assurance that interventions supporting sovereign debt bond prices do not mutate into financial subsidies for unsustainable national policies in the medium term.”
The TPI’s eligibility criteria seem to fall far short of the conditions that Draghi attached to the OMT. That puts the ECB in dangerous territory.
The more it uses its own discretion to decide on TPI eligibility, the more it will be playing a role reserved for elected governments.
Moreover, markets and member states with high public debts will adjust their expectations, anticipating that the TPI will allow for even more debt to be accumulated without an adequate increase in risk premia (and thus interest-rate spreads).
The ECB took this radical step without any evidence that the mid-June increase in spreads was unjustified.
In the future, “The Governing Council will consider a cumulative list of criteria to assess whether the jurisdictions in which the Eurosystem may conduct purchases under the TPI pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies.”
Again, this represents a dangerous departure from the approach adopted under the OMT.
The OMT applied a “strict and effective conditionality” requiring detailed fiscal and structural policy commitments by the recipient government, as well as commitments from other member states to provide financial assistance loans via the European Stability Mechanism.
For a member state to receive support, the ESM and the European Commission would have had to sign a Memorandum of Understanding detailing an adjustment program by which it would make its debt burden sustainable.
The point of these steps was to ensure that all member states, the ESM, and the Commission all had “skin in the game” (both reputational and financial).
By contrast, the TPI does not require an ESM adjustment program, and thus would impose a much greater reputational and financial burden on the ECB than the OMT scheme ever did.
Worse, not only are debt levels much higher now, but eurozone member states’ economic prospects are weaker.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the TPI’s substantially weaker conditionality can be justified.
The TPI thus threatens to reverse a crucial achievement of the last decade.
There is a reason why the ESM was established as the key institution to deal with fiscal problems in individual member states, and why its programs required backing by parliamentary decisions in all eurozone countries.
It was understood that the ECB should not play a role that must be performed by elected officials who are responsible to voters.
This division of labor has become even more important now that inflation is running four times higher than the ECB’s target.
The central bank’s main job is to ensure that inflation expectations are well anchored, so that high inflation does not become entrenched.
Fulfilling that mandate requires decisive policy action.
The ECB should be going to great lengths to dispel any doubt that it is not focused squarely on its primary objective.
Instead, it has devoted its time and energy to designing a scheme that is economically dangerous and politically treacherous.

Trump’s Revolutionary Dilemma
PRINCETON – The Russian Revolution’s centennial this year coincides with the Trump Revolution in the United States, which itself followed the Brexit Revolution in the United Kingdom.
Like the Bolsheviks in 1917, the political movements behind Trump and Brexit consider themselves to be the vanguard of an international revolt – or what former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls a “great global revolution.”
But today’s rebels should consider the lessons of history.
The Russian Revolution took an enormous toll in human lives and wellbeing, and few modern historians think that anything constructive came of it.
And yet Lenin was a political pioneer who understood that revolutionary movements focus on an unpopular but ultimately necessary administrative state or bureaucracy.
The new revolutionary movements, like Bolshevism, are rebelling against what they see as an oppressive and constraining international order.
For Lenin, this order comprised the Western powers that had brought Russia into World War I against Germany – and against its own interests.
For Trump, it is embodied in the vague term “globalism”: “We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually.
It’s not gonna happen anymore.”
And yet these movements’ immediate enemies tend to be domestic rather than foreign.
In a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Stephen Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, declared a revolution for American sovereignty, defined by economic nationalism and the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”
As with all revolutionary programs, Trump and Bannon’s approach is fundamentally about rethinking the state and state power. Still, today’s revolutionary leaders do not fit neatly into conventional categories of left or right, because they promiscuously adopt policies from both camps.
The New York Times quoted a Trump “associate” who claims that the president himself wonders if Bannon is “alt-right or alt-left.”
Regardless of how one categorizes Trump’s domestic agenda, it is clearly a response to a world in which a principle of openness – to foreign goods, capital, and people – coexists with a complex system for regulating these flows.
Foreign goods are subject to national safety and product-information standards; capital flows are managed by controls on bank lending; and migration is limited by an array of checks and conditions.
Trumpism promises to make life simpler, less regulated, and free of dictates from an administrative class by getting rid of international entanglements.
This is a tempting proposition for many ordinary citizens who find globalization complicated and bewildering.
Most people are frustrated by red tape.
But, of course, there is just as much red tape in domestic interactions, where the state regulates everything from product quality and safety to financial services and labor markets.
In the case of Brexit, the original “Leave” campaigners drew a line between the “people” and the “experts,” and they called for dismantling large parts of the British state apparatus, where those experts are apparently ensconced.
As the former Justice Minister and Conservative Party Brexit leader Michael Gove famously put it, “People in this country have had enough of experts,” and “big changes” are needed to change how the government and civil service go about their business.
Once revolutionaries are in power, they quickly come to believe that a conservative “deep state,” intent on obstructing the will of the “people," is undermining them.
Thus, the British Foreign Office is pilloried for being sympathetic to European Union technocrats; and US intelligence services are accused of leaking information to a press corps that has become “the enemy of the people.”
But if the revolutionaries take their war against the state too far, they face a different problem, because members of the old establishment are the only people who know enough about specific government programs to get anything done.
Ultimately, the revolutionaries must try to strike a balance between betraying their supporters’ radical wishes and escalating their conflict with the state to the point that no other policy goals can be achieved.
This same dynamic characterized the Russian Revolution.
Civil servants – chinovniks – were the declared enemy, and concern that the bureaucracy would prevent the revolution from being fully realized fueled radicalization, and reinforced the idea that a revolutionary party must supplant the state altogether.
But the same old problem emerged.
Early twentieth-century Russian society was already very complex.
All sorts of administrative skills – whether to manage railroad networks or to pay and equip the military – were needed to ensure that normal daily life continued.
For Leon Trotsky, Stalin’s accession to power after Lenin’s death was a counter-revolution.
The revolution had been “betrayed” as soon as true revolutionaries like Trotsky were replaced by chinovniks.
The lesson is that revolutionaries confront an impossible dilemma after seizing state power.
If the revolution continues apace, it will disintegrate into incompetence, disillusionment, frenzied witch-hunts, and a recurring cycle of violence.
But if the revolution is aborted, its leaders will be unmasked as empty windbags.
The first revolution of 1917 toppled Czar Nicholas and created a provisional government that, headed by the socialist leader Alexander Kerensky, turned out to be a transitional blip.
Lenin described Kerensky as the “balalaika” played by the old order to continue to deceive the workers and peasants.
But the second revolution – which brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to power – produced a regime that was no less vulnerable to accusations of betrayal.
As today’s revolutionaries try to wield power, we can expect to hear much more talk of betrayal at the hands of the administrative state.
But that state is far more extensive and capable than it was a century ago – and the costs of radicalization would be far higher as well.

Austerity and Debt Realism
CAMBRIDGE – Many, if not all, of the world’s most pressing macroeconomic problems relate to the massive overhang of all forms of debt.
In Europe, a toxic combination of public, bank, and external debt in the periphery threatens to unhinge the eurozone.
Across the Atlantic, a standoff between the Democrats, the Tea Party, and old-school Republicans has produced extraordinary uncertainty about how the United States will close its 8%-of-GDP government deficit over the long term. Japan, meanwhile is running a 10%-of-GDP budget deficit, even as growing cohorts of new retirees turn from buying Japanese bonds to selling them.
Aside from wringing their hands, what should governments be doing?
One extreme is the simplistic Keynesian remedy that assumes that government deficits don’t matter when the economy is in deep recession; indeed, the bigger the better. At the opposite extreme are the debt-ceiling absolutists who want governments to start balancing their budgets tomorrow (if not yesterday).
Both are dangerously facile.
The debt-ceiling absolutists grossly underestimate the massive adjustment costs of a self-imposed “sudden stop” in debt finance.
Such costs are precisely why impecunious countries such as Greece face massive social and economic displacement when financial markets lose confidence and capital flows suddenly dry up.
Of course, there is an appealing logic to saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us; unfortunately, it is not so simple.
Governments typically have myriad ongoing expenditure commitments related to basic services such as national defense, infrastructure projects, education, and health care, not to mention to retirees.
No government can just walk away from these responsibilities overnight.
When US President Ronald Reagan took office on January 20, 1981, he retroactively rescinded all civil-service job offers extended by the government during the two and a half months between his election and the inauguration.
The signal that he intended to slow down government spending was a powerful one, but the immediate effect on the budget was negligible. Of course, a government can also close a budget gap by raising taxes, but any sudden shift can significantly magnify the distortions that taxes cause.
If the debt-ceiling absolutists are naïve, so, too, are simplistic Keynesians.
They see lingering post-financial-crisis unemployment as a compelling justification for much more aggressive fiscal expansion, even in countries already running massive deficits, such as the US and the United Kingdom. People who disagree with them are said to favor “austerity” at a time when hyper-low interest rates mean that governments can borrow for almost nothing.
But who is being naïve?
It is quite right to argue that governments should aim only to balance their budgets over the business cycle, running surpluses during booms and deficits when economic activity is weak.
But it is wrong to think that massive accumulation of debt is a free lunch.
In a series of academic papers with Carmen Reinhart – including, most recently, joint work with Vincent Reinhart (“Debt Overhangs: Past and Present”) – we find that very high debt levels of 90% of GDP are a long-term secular drag on economic growth that often lasts for two decades or more.
The cumulative costs can be stunning.
The average high-debt episodes since 1800 last 23 years and are associated with a growth rate more than one percentage point below the rate typical for periods of lower debt levels.
That is, after a quarter-century of high debt, income can be 25% lower than it would have been at normal growth rates.
Of course, there is two-way feedback between debt and growth, but normal recessions last only a year and cannot explain a two-decade period of malaise.
The drag on growth is more likely to come from the eventual need for the government to raise taxes, as well as from lower investment spending.
So, yes, government spending provides a short-term boost, but there is a trade-off with long-run secular decline.
It is sobering to note that almost half of high-debt episodes since 1800 are associated with low or normal real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates. Japan’s slow growth and low interest rates over the past two decades are emblematic.
Moreover, carrying a huge debt burden runs the risk that global interest rates will rise in the future, even absent a Greek-style meltdown.
This is particularly the case today, when, after sustained massive “quantitative easing” by major central banks, many governments have exceptionally short maturity structures for their debt.
Thus, they run the risk that a spike in interest rates would feed back relatively quickly into higher borrowing costs.
With many of today’s advanced economies near or approaching the 90%-of-GDP level that loosely marks high-debt periods, expanding today’s already large deficits is a risky proposition, not the cost-free strategy that simplistic Keynesians advocate.
I will focus in the coming months on the related problems of high private debt and external debts, and I will also return to the theme of why this is a time when elevated inflation is not so naïve. Above all, voters and politicians must beware of seductively simple approaches to today’s debt problems.

Water Management Is Health Management
LONDON – With climate change accelerating and its effects exacerbating other geopolitical and development crises, the role of environmental protection in preserving and improving human wellbeing has become starkly apparent.
This recognition lies at the heart of the concept of “planetary health,” which focuses on the health of human civilization and the condition of the natural systems on which it depends.
The concept’s logic is simple: if we try to deliver better health to a growing population, without regard for the health and security of our natural resources, we will not just struggle to make new strides; we will reverse the progress already made. Where things get complicated is in applying the concept, particularly when addressing the nexus of water services, health, and ecosystem integrity.
Since at least 1854, when John Snow discovered that cholera was spread through contaminated water supplies in central London, humans have understood that polluted water is bad for our health.
The degradation of freshwater ecosystems often brings disease, just as the protection or strengthening of such ecosystems improves health outcomes.
But, while it is now well understood that progress in one area improves outcomes in another, such co-beneficial dynamics often are insufficient to spur investment in both areas.
For example, investing to protect a watershed can also protect biodiversity and improve water quality in associated rivers, thereby benefiting human health.
But if the goal is explicitly to improve human health, it might be more cost-effective simply to invest in a water-treatment plant.
A more compelling dynamic is complementarity: when investment in one area increases the returns on investment in other areas.
In this scenario, investments in protecting a watershed would aim not just to produce returns directly, but also to boost the returns of simultaneous investments in human health.
Complementarity produces mutually reinforcing dynamics that improve outcomes across the board.
A well-functioning water sector already attempts to balance complementary interventions.
Indeed, such a system amounts to a multidisciplinary triumph of human ingenuity and cooperation – involving engineering, hydrology, governance, and urban planning – with far-reaching complementary impacts on both human health and economic development.
In 1933, through the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, the United States established an agency whose purpose was to build hydroelectric dams on the Tennessee River.
That effort benefited industry, agriculture, flood control, and conservation throughout the Tennessee Valley watershed, until then one of the country’s most disadvantaged regions.
Since then, governments worldwide have recognized the potential of water infrastructure to complement other economic and social policies, including those intended to improve health outcomes.
It is no coincidence that one of the World Bank’s largest lending portfolios – $35 billion worth of investments – comprises water projects.
But understanding the potential of complementarity is just the first step.
To maximize results, we must design a coherent strategy that takes full advantage of the dynamic, at the lowest possible cost.
The question is whether there is an optimal mix of environmental protection and direct health interventions on which policymakers can rely to maximize investment returns for both.
A recent analysis suggests that, in rural areas, a 30% increase in upstream tree cover produces a 4% reduction in the probability of diarrheal disease in children – a result comparable to investing in an improved sanitation facility.
But, if that is true, we have yet to determine at what point reforestation becomes a better investment than improving sanitation, let alone increases the returns of other health interventions by the highest possible amount.
Another study found that an estimated 42% of the global malaria burden, including a half-million deaths annually, could be eliminated through policies focused on issues like land use, deforestation, water resource management, and settlement siting.
But the study didn’t cover the potential benefits of employing insecticide-treated nets as a tool for fighting malaria, ruling out a comparison of the two investments’ returns.
Worldwide, around 40% of cities’ source watersheds show high to moderate levels of degradation.
Sediment from agricultural and other sources increases the cost of water treatment, while loss of natural vegetation and land degradation can change water-flow patterns.
All of this can adversely affect supply, thereby increasing the need to store water in containers – such as drums, tanks, and concrete jars – that serve as mosquito larval habitats.
Can we show that ecological restoration of the watershed could do more than just insecticides or mosquito nets to support efforts to reduce malaria (and dengue) in cities?
In all of these cases, finding the best option requires knowing not just the relative contribution of different interventions, but understanding their complementarity.
In a world of limited resources, policymakers must prioritize their investments, including by differentiating the necessary from the desirable.
To that end, finding ways to identify and maximize complementarity is vital.
Some 2.1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe, readily available water at home, and more than twice as many – a whopping 4.5 billion – lack safely managed sanitation, severely undermining health outcomes and fueling river pollution.
With a growing share of the world’s population – including many of the same people – feeling the effects of environmental degradation and climate change firsthand, finding solutions that simultaneously advance environmental protection, water provision, and health could not be more important.
Global health and conservation professionals must cooperate more closely to find those solutions – and convince policymakers to pursue them.

France Goes to Hollande
PARIS – France has now conducted its ninth presidential election under direct universal suffrage.
And, for the first time in 17 years, after three consecutive defeats, the left – embodied in the Socialist candidate, François Hollande – will return to Élysée Palace.
Indeed, the first implication of this unquestionably significant election is that it confirms a return to stability.
France is the largest country in Europe to have so much trouble finding its balance.
Its revolution in 1789 initiated a long period of profound instability, featuring two empires, three monarchies, and five republics.
The French have gone through 13 constitutions in less than 200 years.
At 54 years old, the current Fifth Republic is the second longest-lasting regime since the revolution.
At times, there has been talk of a Sixth Republic, which would address limited but real concerns and difficulties.
But voter turnout in the latest presidential election (80% in the first round, and 81% in the second round) leaves no doubt: our current system is strong, and we French are attached to it.
But the primary importance of the election result is the left’s return to power for only the second time in 31 years.
In fact, when François Mitterand was elected in 1981, the left had been out of power since 1957.
Back then, the Communist Party was still powerful, and maintained close ties with the Soviet Union.
The prospect that the Party could come to power in an electoral alliance with the Socialists struck fear in opponents.
The Socialists, for their part, had not yet shed their intellectual skin.
Mitterand’s political program was a hymn to economic planning, and the free market was still, for him, synonymous with oppression.
Today, there is no longer international communism, or, for that matter, French communism.
We remember having seen the left govern without drama.
Its two passages to power – ten years under Mitterand and five years with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin – forced the left to reconcile with reality.
France’s international reputation was not damaged, and, at home, the left’s performance, especially concerning unemployment, compared well with that of other governments.
So, there will be no panic this time.
On the contrary, the left’s return to power appears to be an entirely normal, almost trivial, example of alternation in government.
In fact, Hollande’s victory was underpinned not by a leftward shift among the electorate, but by voters’ rejection of Nicolas Sarkozy.
Indeed, the result represents a stunning and historic defeat: during the Fifth Republic, three sitting presidents – Charles de Gaulle, Mitterrand, and Jacques Chirac – have been reelected after their first term in office.
Only Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, weakened by the long decline of Gaullism, was not.
The rejection of Sarkozy is very different; above all, it is a matter of style.
There remains a type of royalism among the French, and our constitution has many features of an elective monarchy.
With his over-familiarity, simplicity, and occasional vulgarity, Sarkozy undermined the dignity of his sacred function.
This was not forgiven, and was judged more severely than the shortcomings of his presidential record, which was not significantly worse than that of his predecessors.
Moreover, in substantive terms, Sarkozy’s tax policies, in particular, favored the upper classes and the wealthy.
So a powerful combination of social and economic anger emerged, particularly given the perception that the excessive greed of financiers and bankers was the primary cause of the crisis that erupted in 2008, and that still menaces us today.
A social and political correction was necessary, and it has occurred with a vengeance unique to France.
But the state’s coffers are dangerously depleted, and France now finds itself among the many countries whose debt burden compromises the eurozone’s existence.
Thus, it is now subject to the discourse of economic orthodoxy, which, in insisting that all debts be paid to the penny, ignores that public spending is also an engine of growth.
Just how much will actually have to be repaid? With Germany as the primary exponent of orthodoxy, the debate has raged on.
But now we see that austerity has plunged Greece, Portugal, and especially Spain and Italy deeply into recession.
The president of the European Central Bank, as well as the International Monetary Fund, acknowledge the gravity of the problem.
But what happens if we refuse to accept Germany’s position?
The victory of Hollande, who has said that he wants to “renegotiate” the European Union’s new, German-backed “fiscal compact,” will weigh heavily in this debate.
Furthermore, the Socialists now control not only the presidency and the government, but also a majority in the Senate, all of the regional presidencies, 55% of the country’s departments, and most major cities’ town halls. In less than two months, they may control a majority of the National Assembly as well, implying a concentration of power that has never before been seen in modern France.
The Socialists can govern without limits, so it is up to them to govern well.
It is this uncertainty that hovers over the future of France, if not that of Europe.

Clicks over Bricks in India
SINGAPORE – After years of debate, India’s government recently announced that will open the country’s retail sector to foreign investment.
The move was met with howls of protest from those who argue that the entry of large hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Walmart will devastate the small shops that currently dominate India’s retail sector.
A country-wide strike called by opposition parties on September 20 brought many cities and towns to a halt.
So far, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government has not relented, despite the loss of support from a key coalition ally.
The debate around opening the retail sector to foreign investment is currently being framed, on the one hand, by the need to modernize supply chains and, on the other hand, by the desire to protect small shopkeepers’ livelihoods. Those who support the decision argue that India’s supply chains are simply too wasteful, and that only the finance and knowhow of big, international retail chains can upgrade them.
Opponents point to how big retailers decimated the traditional retail segment in the West.
But this debate misses a crucial point: the hypermarket model is itself under serious threat everywhere from online shopping.
Consumers worldwide are finding that they can access virtually unlimited choice on the Internet – including customized goods and services that big retailers simply cannot deliver.
As a result, large hypermarkets are suddenly finding that their business model is unraveling.
They watched in horror as Amazon, en route to becoming the world’s largest online retailer, pushed the bookstore chain Borders into bankruptcy, and have wondered if they will be next. The American discount retailer Walmart, reportedly concerned that it is cannibalizing its own sales, has gone so far as to stop selling Amazon’s Kindle tablets.
Indeed, the Indian government’s decision to welcome foreign retailers coincided with French retailer Carrefour’s announcement that it will shut down its substantial operations in Singapore by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, its British counterpart, Tesco, is shifting away from the large hypermarket format and investing heavily in online systems. Quite clearly, the established framework of retailing is being fundamentally overhauled.
Given these developments, India may simply skip the hypermarket stage and go online, just as it skipped fixed-line telephony and went mobile.
Of course, hypermarkets will do well in a few locations, but they are unlikely ever to dominate India’s retail sector.
For small shopkeepers, this poses both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is that the rise of online shopping will increase competitive pressure, regardless of whether big foreign retailers enter the market.
While Indians have traditionally been wary of buying online, owing to their distrust of digital security, in recent years the urban middle class has become increasingly accustomed to using the Internet to purchase airline tickets, reserve hotel rooms, and order books.
As rising affluence and falling technology prices make online shopping accessible to a growing pool of customers, more products will follow.
Change is inevitable.
But this shift may also open an opportunity for small shops.
We know from international experience that online shopping undermines hypermarkets more than neighborhood stores, which often offer home delivery, credit, and the reassuring familiarity of personal relationships.
A local shop may be able to use the Internet to tailor more precisely its selection of goods to its customers’ tastes.
In other words, small shops may be more than capable of holding their own against big retailers if they adapt to the new environment.
Indeed, small shops’ advantages are so compelling that Tesco is investing heavily in expanding its network of convenience stores, Tesco Express, thereby effectively mimicking the traditional model of local grocery stores.
So India’s political debate over the entry of foreign retailers into the market, while heated, is probably already outdated.
The real question is how India’s creaking supply chains will respond when consumers leapfrog hypermarkets and go online.
No other country has created a logistical network directly for online retailing. For investors and businesses – perhaps including India’s small shopkeepers – this is where the really interesting opportunities will emerge.

Getting Productivism Right
CAMBRIDGE – I wrote recently about the possible emergence, from both the left and right of the political spectrum, of a new economic-policy paradigm that could supersede neoliberalism.
The new framework gives governments and community organizations greater responsibility to shape investment and production – in support of good jobs, the climate transition, and more secure, resilient societies – and is much more suspicious of markets and large corporations than the outgoing paradigm is.
I called it “productivism,” though others can no doubt think of sexier appellations.
Throughout history, the pendulum of economic ideology has swung from deification of markets to reliance on the state and then back again.
Superficially, we appear to be in the midst of another periodic realignment.
It was perhaps inevitable that neoliberalism’s excesses – increased inequality, concentration of corporate power, and neglect of threats to the physical and social environment – would trigger a backlash.
But establishing new paradigms requires developing novel approaches, not just emulating the old.
When the New Deal and the welfare state replaced the freewheeling capitalism that preceded them, policymakers did not simply revert to former mercantilist practices.
They established new regulatory regimes and social-insurance institutions, and embraced explicit macroeconomic management in the form of Keynesianism.
Similarly, if productivism is to be successful, it will have to move beyond conventional social protection, industrial policies, and macroeconomic management.
It will need to internalize lessons learned from past failures and adapt to fundamentally new challenges.
State interventions aimed at reshaping an economy’s structure – so-called industrial policies – have traditionally been faulted for being ineffective and vulnerable to capture by special interests.
“Governments cannot pick winners,” as the old adage goes.
But much of this criticism is overdone.
While there have been notable failures, recent systematic studies find that industrial policies encouraging investment and job creation in disadvantaged regions have often worked surprisingly well.
Public-sector initiatives have been behind some of the most impressive high-tech successes of our time, including the internet and GPS.
For every Solyndra, the US solar cell manufacturer that failed spectacularly after obtaining $500 million in federal government loan guarantees, there is often a Tesla, the phenomenally successful electric battery and vehicle manufacturer that also received government support at a critical phase of its development.
Nevertheless, there is much room for improvement.
The most effective industrial policies entail close, collaborative interaction between government agencies and private firms, whereby companies receive critical public inputs – financial support, skilled workers, or technological assistance – in exchange for meeting soft and evolving targets on investment and employment. This kind of industrial policy is likely to work much better – whether in promoting local economic development or directing major national technological efforts – than open-ended subsidies or tax incentives.
As the name suggests, productivism focuses on enhancing the productive capabilities of all regions and all segments of society.
While traditional forms of social assistance and especially better access to education and health care can help in this regard, connecting people with productive employment opportunities requires improvements on the demand side of the labor market as well as on the supply side.
Policies must directly encourage an increase in the quantity and quality of jobs available for the less educated and less skilled members of the workforce, wherever they choose (or can afford) to live.
In the future, the bulk of these jobs will come not from manufacturing, but from services such as health care, long-term care, and retail.
In the United States, virtually all net new job creation in the private sector since the late 1970s has taken place in services, and less than one in ten workers are currently employed in manufacturing.
Even if US policy succeeds in reshoring manufacturing and supply chains, the effect on employment is likely to be limited.
The experience of East Asian manufacturing superstars such as South Korea and Taiwan provides a sobering example.
While the share of manufacturing value added in GDP (at constant prices) in these two countries has increased rapidly, their manufacturing employment ratios have steadily declined.
This observation is important, because much US policy is focused on promoting high-tech manufacturing, including the bill recently passed by Congress that will provide $52 billion in funding for semiconductors and related manufacturing.
The initiative is aimed at both enhancing US national security vis-à-vis China and creating good jobs. Unfortunately, even if the first objective is met, the second is likely to remain elusive.
A similar point can be made about the subsidies for green technologies that are a core component of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden is likely to sign soon.
The green transition is without question an urgent priority that the new paradigm needs to tackle.
But here, too, governments cannot kill two birds with one stone.
Policies that target climate change are not a substitute for good-job policies, and vice versa.
Shoring up the middle class and disseminating the benefits of technology broadly through society requires an explicit good-jobs strategy.
Such an approach would not be so fixated on competition with China, would target services instead of manufacturing, and would focus on promoting worker-friendly technologies.
It is too soon to tell whether a new productivism paradigm will jell, let alone prove adequate to the tasks at hand.
Inflation worries may yet come to dominate policymaking and subordinate structural transformation.
Price stability is a sine qua non for the pursuit of productivist economic policies. But a return to orthodox macroeconomic approaches focused on monetary tightening and deficit reduction will leave little fertile ground for policy innovation and experimentation.
Ultimately, what economies need is sound ideas, not necessarily a new paradigm.
By the time any set of ideas becomes conventional wisdom, it is riddled with one-size-fits-all generalizations and truisms that are bound to be unhelpful and misleading.
If the new thinking on productivism is successful, it will eventually be described as a “paradigm,” whether we call it that or not.

Are Cities Finished?
PARIS – Rue de Rivoli, a boulevard running through the heart of Paris, has been developed in fits and starts.
Napoleon Bonaparte initiated construction in 1802, after years of planning and debate, but work stalled following the emperor’s abdication in 1814.
The boulevard remained in limbo until another military strongman, Napoleon III, completed the project in the 1850s.
The next century, construction began again – this time, to accommodate cars.
But this past spring, Rue de Rivoli experienced its fastest transformation yet.
With Paris traffic subdued by a COVID-19 lockdown, Mayor Anne Hidalgo decided on April 30 to close the nearly two-mile-long road to cars, in order to create more space for pedestrians and bicyclists.
Workers repainted the road and transformed a major artery in central Paris – home of the world-renowned Louvre museum – virtually overnight.
It was not just Rue de Rivoli.
Using only paint and screw-in markers, nearly 100 miles of Parisian roads were temporarily reallocated to cyclists in the early months of the pandemic – a revolution in urban reprogramming.
It was later announced that the changes would become permanent.
The Parisian example highlights the extent to which the pandemic has accelerated the pace of urban innovation, compressing what would have taken years into months or even weeks.
Beyond highlighting the flaws in pre-pandemic urban systems – such as high levels of pollution – it has allowed city leaders to bypass cumbersome bureaucracy, and respond much more efficiently to the needs of people and businesses.
Those needs are changing fast.
One of the most discussed changes relates to the separation of home and work.
In the early days of urbanization, people walked to work.
Later, they began to take public transport.
It was only after World War II and the rise of suburbanization that people began to drive cars from their homes to giant factory complexes and office towers.
During the pandemic, remote work has become the rule in many industries – and many companies plan to keep it that way, at least to a large extent.
This re-integration of work and home threatens one of the last remaining vestiges of the Industrial Age: central business districts that pack and stack office workers in skyscrapers.
With many workers unlikely to return to their cubicles, old office towers may be transformed into much-needed affordable housing after the pandemic.
One-dimensional business districts could become vibrant neighborhoods.
Non-work activities have been transformed as well.
Dining, entertainment, and fitness have increasingly been moving into the open air, occupying space that used to be designated for cars. So, as with the bike lanes in Paris, the pandemic is creating prototypes for a permanently post-automobile, human-centric city.
In fact, the changes in Paris are part of a broader plan to create a “15-minute city” (ville du quart d’heure), where core daily activities – including working, learning, and shopping – can be carried out just a short walk or bike ride from home.
So, far from rendering cities obsolete, as some predicted early on, the pandemic has unlocked an ever-broader potential for renaissance – what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “creative destruction” on an urban scale.
The crisis left governments with little choice but to adopt a fast-paced, trial-and-error approach.
The extraordinary innovations in pedestrianization, affordable housing, and dynamic zoning that have emerged highlight the power of positive feedback loops.
Nonetheless, a Schumpeterian approach is fundamentally experimental, and even the best-designed experiments sometimes fail.
Moreover, the costs of those failures are not borne equally: those with the least influence tend to suffer the most.
The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has disproportionately affected the poor and vulnerable.
In this new age of urban innovation, leaders must take great care to minimize the risks to – and redistribute the returns toward – disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.
That means, first and foremost, listening to them.
The Black Lives Matter movement in the United States is a powerful example of a disadvantaged group demanding to be heard. Leaders everywhere should pay attention and address racial and class divides head on.
Urban design is central to any such strategy.
To support this process – and help maintain flexibility and speed in urban innovation after the pandemic – leaders should consider creating participatory digital platforms to enable residents to communicate their needs.
This could encourage policies that improve quality of life in cities – especially disadvantaged neighborhoods – including by limiting problematic trends like rising pollution and gentrification. Only with an agile and inclusive approach can we seize this once-in-a-century opportunity – or, rather, meet our urgent obligation – to “build back better.”
A stroll along Rue de Rivoli today reveals none of the desolation and dullness we have come to expect on city streets during the pandemic.
Instead, the storied boulevard is bustling with masked Parisians, zooming along on bikes, scooters, e-bikes, and rollerblades, or pausing for coffee at cafes and restaurants.
A street deadened by the pandemic has been revived.
With thoughtful planning, bold experimentation, and luck, such transformations can be just the start for cities everywhere.

Speaking to the Far Right
NEW YORK – Something many right-wing populists have in common is a peculiar form of self-pity: the feeling of being victimized by the liberal media, academics, intellectuals, “experts” – in short, by the so-called elites.
The liberal elites, the populists proclaim, rule the world and dominate ordinary patriotic people with an air of lofty disdain.
This is in many ways an old-fashioned view.
Liberals, or leftists, do not dominate politics any more.
And the influence that great left-of-center newspapers, like The New York Times, once had has long been eclipsed by radio talk-show hosts, rightwing cable TV stations, tabloid newspapers (largely owned by Rupert Murdoch in the English-speaking world), and social media.
Influence, however, is not the same thing as prestige.
The great newspapers, like the great universities, still enjoy a higher status than the more popular press, and the same goes for higher learning.
TheSun or Bild lack the esteem of the Financial Times or the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and evangelical colleges in rural parts of the US cannot compete in terms of cachet with Harvard or Yale.
Social status arouses more envy and resentment in our populist age than money or fame do.
President Donald Trump, for example, is a very wealthy man, who was more famous than any of his rivals for the US presidency, including Hillary Clinton.
And yet he seems to be in an almost permanent rage against people who have greater intellectual or social prestige than he does.
The fact that he shares this resentment with millions of people who are much less privileged goes a long way toward explaining his political success.
Until recently, figures on the extreme right had no prestige at all.
Driven to the margins of most societies by collective memories of Nazi and fascist horrors, such men (there were hardly any women) had the grubby air of middle-aged patrons of backstreet porno cinemas.
Stephen Bannon, still a highly influential figure in Trump’s world, seems a bit like that – a crank in a dirty raincoat.
But much has changed.
Younger members of the far right, especially in Europe, are often sharply dressed in tailor-made suits, recalling the fascist dandies of pre-war France and Italy.
They don’t shout at large mobs, but are slick performers in radio and TV studios, and are savvy users of social media.
Some of them even have a sense of humor.
These new-model rightists are almost what Germans call salonfähig, respectable enough to move in high circles.
Overt racism is muted; their bigotry is disguised under a lot of smart patter.
They crave prestige.
I had occasion to encounter a typical ideologue of this type recently at an academic conference organized by the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College in the United States.
The conference was about populism, and the ideologue was named Marc Jongen, a politician from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party with a doctorate in philosophy.
The son of a Dutch father and an Italian mother, born in Italy’s German-speaking South Tyrol, Jongen spoke near-perfect English.
Self-pity lay close to the surface.
Jongen described Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to give shelter in Germany to large numbers of refugees from Middle Eastern wars as “an act of violence” toward the German people.
He called immigrants and refugees criminals and rapists (even though crime rates among refugees in Germany are far lower than among “natives”).
Islam was robbing the German Volk of its true identity.
Men like Jongen were always being called Nazis.
And so on.
I had been asked to furnish some counterarguments.
I did not call Jongen a Nazi.
But I did my best to point out why I thought his claims were both wrong and dangerous.
We shook hands at the end.
And that, as far as I was concerned, was that.
Then a minor academic storm broke out.
More than 50 distinguished US academics signed a letter protesting the Hannah Arendt Center’s decision to invite Jongen to speak.
The point was not that he didn’t have the right to express his opinions, but that Bard College should not have lent its prestige to make the speaker look respectable.
Inviting him to speak made his views seem legitimate.
This strikes me as wrongheaded for several reasons.
First of all, if one is going to organize a conference on right-wing populism, it is surely useful to hear what a right-wing populist actually has to say.
Listening to professors denouncing ideas without actually hearing what they are would not be very instructive.
Nor is it obvious that a spokesman for a major opposition party in a democratic state should be considered out of bounds as a speaker on a college campus.
Left-wing revolutionaries were once a staple of campus life, and efforts to ban them would rightly have been resisted.
The protest against inviting Jongen was not only intellectually incoherent; it was also tactically stupid, because it confirms the belief of the far right that liberals are the enemies of free speech, and that right-wing populists are victims of liberal intolerance.
I like to think that Jongen left the Bard conference politely discredited.
Because of the protest, he was able to snatch victory from defeat.

Three Lessons from the Hong Kong Protests
LONDON – The massive protests in Hong Kong in recent weeks have demonstrated the depth of its citizens’ determination to uphold their democratic way of life – something they were supposedly guaranteed when the United Kingdom returned sovereignty over the city to China in 1997.
Moreover, the protests hold three powerful lessons: for Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, for the demonstrators themselves, and for China’s rulers.
Over the past few years, the Chinese authorities have steadily increased their interference in Hong Kong’s affairs, gradually eroding the “one country, two systems” principle that was meant to ensure a “high degree of autonomy” for the city after 1997. The current crisis stems from China’s desire for a legal framework to return fugitives from the mainland who have allegedly used the city as a safe haven for ill-gotten wealth.
In many respects, the extradition law introduced by Lam represented an extension of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign to Hong Kong, and was intended to avoid further incidents like Chinese security officers’ 2017 abduction of tycoon Xiao Jianhua from the city.
There is no evidence that China gave Lam detailed instructions on enacting the law.
Instead, she seems to have taken it upon herself to introduce it.
However, Lam exceeded her remit by making the proposed extradition law applicable not only to fugitive mainland Chinese, but also to all ordinary Hong Kong citizens, as well as foreigners temporarily residing in or visiting the city.
The proposed legislation was so sweeping that democratic activists, as well as businesspeople who had fallen out with mainland partners, feared they might be legally extradited to China to stand trial under its party-controlled legal system.
Businesses also worried that their assets might be confiscated.
As banners and slogans at the demonstrations made clear, the protesters were not targeting the Communist Party of China (CPC) or Xi. Nor was it the popular perception of Lam as Beijing’s puppet that eventually brought two million Hong Kong residents – almost 30% of the city’s population – onto the streets.
Rather, the enormous protests reflected citizens’ widespread concern for their way of life, and anger at Lam’s gross mismanagement.
The chief executive has shown staggering political ineptitude.
For starters, Lam tried to rush the controversial bill through the city’s legislature rather than following normal procedures. Worse, she then ordered the police to respond with force to the June 9 demonstration, which mobilized one million protesters.
Coming shortly after the sensitive 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and just when Xi was preparing to meet US President Donald Trump to seek a suspension of the Sino-American trade war, the police response in Hong Kong was an embarrassment, and not what China wanted.
In ordering the crackdown, Lam ignored norms for policing large-scale demonstrations in Hong Kong that had existed since the 1980s.
Officers would monitor the demonstrations wearing soft hats and armed with bottled water, and offer help to any demonstrator needing assistance.
In the past, this approach had invariably secured the protesters’ cooperation. But the deployment of police in riot gear, and their use of pepper spray, tear gas, and rubber bullets, fueled public anger and led inevitably to outbreaks of violence.
Lam’s initial response was to offer a half-hearted apology and promise to suspend the bill, while insisting that those who had been arrested were rioters. This made citizens angrier still, and led China eventually to withdraw its support for her.
Lam’s subsequent, more forthright apology, and her promise that the bill would not be reintroduced in the foreseeable future, has since curbed public outrage, and the massive demonstrations have ceased for now.
But popular sentiment remains raw.
The first and most obvious lesson of recent events is that Lam is a liability as chief executive, and that she has squandered all credibility.
She has also been an embarrassment to China and an ineffective regional leader.
Xi and his government will keep her in place for the time being, both to avoid handing a scalp to the protesters and because a suitable replacement must be found.
But the prospect of Lam serving a full term in office is now remote.
The best thing she can do for Hong Kong is to resign before China sacks her.
She will find out soon enough that the CPC does not forget or forgive.
Second, Hong Kong’s protesters and activists have succeeded so far because they did not directly challenge Xi or the CPC, but instead focused on Lam’s failings and demanded withdrawal of the extradition bill.
Xi was able to withdraw support for the chief executive in large part because she had failed him.
Had Lam merely been doing what she was told, Xi could not have backed down without appearing weak.
Third, China should recognize that its process for selecting Hong Kong’s chief executive is deeply flawed.
Lam is politically inept largely because she lacks the nous that every elected politician acquires through the hurly-burly of electioneering.
Chosen by a “selectorate,” Hong Kong’s leader lacks the necessary political skills to perform his or her duties properly – a problem for all of Lam’s predecessors going back to 1997.
If China’s leaders cannot endorse a genuine direct election of the chief executive, they should at least revert to their previous plan of holding a popular vote after objectionable candidates have been screened out.
Hong Kong’s democrats should accept this as a compromise.
It is in everyone’s interest to minimize the risk of massive protests escalating out of control and turning into a direct confrontation between the city and the CPC.

How Can Developing Countries Pay for the SDGs?
MANCHESTER – With objectives as far-reaching as ending poverty in all its forms and delivering quality education to all by 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are highly ambitious – much more ambitious than their predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals.
Whether or not the world achieves them will depend crucially on money – particularly public finance.
Traditionally, official development assistance (ODA) would play a pivotal role in financing an agenda like the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, which encompasses the 17 SDGs.
But at a time when nationalist rhetoric and isolationist policies are gaining traction in some of the world’s biggest traditional donor countries – beginning with the United States – ODA will not be sufficient.
In fact, foreign aid has remained flat, at best, in the last few years – and there is no increase in sight. On the contrary, the specter of global recession – heightened by US President Donald Trump’s trade war – makes a reduction in donor governments’ revenues, together with increased domestic demand for public spending, a distinct possibility.
None of this bodes well for foreign aid flows.
This means that, to implement the SDGs, developing countries will need to rely increasingly on their own resources.
And, in fact, the 2030 Agenda anticipates this imperative: SDG17’s first target is to “strengthen domestic resource mobilization … to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection.”
The question is how.
Poor fiscal management means that developing countries – particularly in Africa, home to 27 of the world’s 28 poorest countries – are often plagued by debt crises and inflation, and many are at the mercy of commodity-price cycles.
Tax collection is a major challenge for these economies: the tax revenues low-income countries collect amount to about 10-20% of GDP, on average, compared to about 40% of GDP in high-income countries.
One major reason for this is that these countries tend to have large informal economies; another is that they invest little in the infrastructure needed to implement personal taxation, relying instead on sales taxes, which are easier to administer but bring in less revenue. Add to that poor management of what is collected, and these countries consistently fail to deliver needed public goods and services, let alone ensure fiscal sustainability.
The effectiveness of tax collection and the strength of budgetary systems, our research shows, depend crucially on the extent to which political institutions place constraints on executive power.
Governments with credible, institutionalized systems of checks and balances tend not only to collect more tax revenues, but also to have more transparent and predictable budgetary processes.
A major reason for this is accountability.
Giving a single executive virtually unchecked control over a government’s financial resources raises the risk of sudden changes in budgetary priorities, and nurtures the temptation to spend on projects that enrich a few at the expense of the public good. But when political leaders are unable to use state revenues freely – say, to enrich themselves or their cronies – they may be more likely to invest in strengthening the government’s fiscal capacity, including its ability to design, implement, and monitor the budget.
In a well-functioning parliamentary system, for example, the state budget is overseen by a group of elected authorities in a relatively transparent manner.
No one person has the power to shape the process in self-serving ways.
Instead, leaders are under pressure to respond to the voters’ needs and preferences.
In such a context, taxation becomes an informed, consensual transaction between citizens and the state.
This bolsters trust in official institutions, in turn boosting revenues and supporting social and political stability.
According to our research, placing institutional constraints on the executive would, over about nine years, lead to a 2.4-percentage-point increase in the GDP share of both total revenues and income-tax revenues.
Such changes would also raise the quality of fiscal planning – the accuracy of revenue forecasts and the effectiveness of budget implementation and debt management – above the global average.
These gains could translate into more textbooks in local schools, more vaccines for local health services, and more resources for poverty-reduction programs.
In other words, a taxation system constrained by institutions that ensure transparency and accountability could support progress toward achieving the SDGs.
Of course, the effects will not be instantaneous.
Institutional reform is a gradual process, and legal changes do not immediately translate into behavioral ones.
But embedding checks and balances into governance – particularly to limit the executive’s discretionary budgetary authority – is integral to accomplish the kind of structural transformation developing countries need if they are to create more stable, prosperous futures well beyond 2030.

Europe Is Blocking Russia
Russia's political and strategic accommodation with the West continues apace.
Day by day, relations with NATO grow stronger.
The new orientation is irrevocable.
But despite the price that President Putin is paying at home for his pro-Western policies--which are not nearly as popular in Russia as they are in the West--scant economic rewards, particularly from the European Union, have appeared.
Europe, indeed, seems to be in no hurry to give Russia improved access to its markets.
European Commission President Romano Prodi confirmed Russia's status as a "market economy" at last May's EU-Russia summit, a move that should have improved Russia's access to European markets. But it now seems unlikely that individual EU member states will approve this designation by September 18 th , which they must if it is to enter into force.
Instead of opening the door, the EU seems determined to find covert ways to close its markets to Russian goods. Since May, the EU commission on trade policy has been preparing strict new rules to manage Russia's exports to the Union.
These new regulations may turn the promise heralded by Russia being accorded "market economy status" into a mere formality that will not increase Russia's access to the EU market by a single iota.
Among the tactics the EU is using to retard Russian trade are numerous antidumping investigations aimed at Russian companies. These probes, which have the effect of blocking exports from targeted firms, cost Russian businesses $1.3 billion a year in lost exports--a huge loss in an economy that is hurting as much as Russia is.
The EU's trade regulators argue that they have the right--and the obligation--to initiate antidumping investigations if they suspect that a state, say, regulates prices for energy carriers in a way that subsidizes domestic firms.
If they find Russia "guilty" of subsidizing its industry through low-cost energy, they can deem Russian goods as "dumped" and impose trade restrictions. This is a blatantly hypocritical stance, given the regulation of energy that goes on within the EU--say, in France.
For Russia to prove that it does not use regulated energy prices as hidden industrial subsidies, it will have to make its case using international accounting standards.
Or so the EU demands.
But Russia's accounting standards--no surprise--have not yet reached international standards.
Implementing such standards in Russia is beyond the capacity of most businesses, something that should be self-evident, given how new modern businesses practices are to the country.
True, these EU requirements were not designed simply to frustrate Russia. They are applicable to all market economies that trade with it.
But the EU is using its rules and investigative procedures in ways specifically aimed at Russian businesses.
Besides, given the stories of rampant corruption in accounting practices in the West nowadays, the EU should be more understanding.
The Enron and Worldcom scandals, after all, occurred in countries with long histories as market economies.
Although it is beginning to wean companies off the practice, Russia does indeed sell energy cheaply to people and industries that became addicted to subsidized energy under socialism.
Russia has also failed to establish international accounting standards across its economy.
But Russia has repeatedly discussed the reasons for these problems with EU officials, and has pointed out the reforms now underway.
Change cannot occur overnight.
But even when all the reforms are enacted, Russian energy prices will remain cheaper than in Europe.
This reflects Russia's natural advantage as an energy producer.
The EU seems to want to penalize Russia for its natural wealth.
We have rich reserves of gas and coal.
We have the great resources of Siberia.
We have hydroelectric power plants.
We produce cheap electric energy.
To force Russia to increase energy prices to EU levels is as ridiculous as making China sell rice to its people at world prices.
The EU's emerging anti-Russian trade policy is not an antidumping policy; it is outright protectionism.
Moreover, European companies are not weak.
What, exactly, are they so afraid of?
Russia is not strong enough to sink any part of the European market.
Europe's national political leaders, who so often proclaim their joy at growing closeness to Russia, must halt the efforts of those in the EU Commission who seek to sabotage EU/Russia trade relations.
Meanwhile, Russia must mobilize its own diplomats to make the case, publicly and privately in all the EU capitals, for greater access to EU markets.
Europeans who want to develop relations with Russia and the majority of businessmen--European and Russian--with interests in greater trade must also be induced to lobby in favor of greater openness.
All of this needs to be done fast, by September 18 th .
Otherwise, Russians will come to view being accorded "market economy" status as just another broken promise on the part of the West.

One Hundred Years of Devastation
NEW DELHI – On July 1, the Communist Party of China (CPC) will stage a patriotic extravaganza to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding.
Among the achievements it will celebrate is the Baihetan Dam, located on the Jinsha River, on the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.
The dam will start operations on the same day.
The CPC loves a superlative.
It is the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter, with the world’s largest foreign reserves.
It boasts the world’s highest railway and the highest and longest bridges.
It is also the world’s most dammed country, with more large dams than the rest of the world combined, and prides itself on having the world’s biggest water-transfer canal system.
The dams themselves are often superlative.
The Three Gorges Dam is the world’s largest power station, in terms of installed capacity, and the Baihetan Dam is billed as the world’s biggest arch dam, as well as the world’s first project to use a giant one-gigawatt (GW) hydro-turbine generator.
With 16 such generators, Baihetan ranks as the world’s second-largest hydroelectric dam (behind the Three Gorges Dam, at 22.5 GW).
All of this makes great fodder for CPC-fueled nationalism – essential to the party’s legitimacy.
China often flaunts its hydroengineering prowess, including its execution of the most ambitious inter-river water transfers ever conceived, to highlight its military and economic might.
(To be sure, there are also superlatives China will not be flaunting at its upcoming centenary – beginning with the world’s largest network of concentration camps.)
But China’s dams are not merely symbols of the country’s greatness.
Nor is their purpose simply to ensure China’s water security, as the CPC claims.
They are also intended as a source of leverage that China can use to exert control over downstream countries.
The CPC’s 1951 annexation of the water-rich Tibetan Plateau – the starting point of Asia’s ten major river systems – gave China tremendous power over Asia’s water map.
In the ensuing decades, the country has made the most of this riparian advantage.
For example, by building 11 giant dams on the Mekong, just before the river crosses into Southeast Asia, China has secured the ability to turn off the region’s water tap.
But the CPC is failing to consider the high costs of its strategy, which extend far beyond political friction with neighbors.
The party’s insatiable damming is wreaking environmental havoc on Asia’s major river systems, including mainland China’s dual lifelines: the Yellow and the Yangtze.
Giant dams damage ecosystems, drive freshwater species to extinction, cause deltas to retreat, and often emit more greenhouse gases than fossil-fuel power plants.
More than 350 lakes in China have disappeared in recent decades, and, with few free-flowing rivers left, river fragmentation and depletion have become endemic.
The social costs are no less severe.
For starters, given shoddy construction in the first three decades of communist rule, about 3,200 dams collapsed by 1981, with the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure alone killing up to 230,000 people.
Of course, China has raised its dam-building prowess dramatically since then, and Baihetan was completed in just four years. But as its early dams age, and weather becomes increasingly extreme, catastrophic failures remain a serious risk.
Moreover, dam projects have displaced an enormous number of Chinese.
In 2007, just as China’s mega-dam-building drive was gaining momentum, then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao revealed that, since the CPC’s rise to power, China had relocated 22.9 million people to make way for water projects – a figure larger than more than 100 countries’ entire populations.
The Three Gorges Dam alone displaced more than 1.4 million people.
This doesn’t seem to bother the CPC much.
Baihetan’s inundation of vast stretches of a sparsely populated highland has forced local residents, mostly from the relatively poor Yi nationality, to farm more marginal tracts at higher elevations. As China shifts its focus from the dam-saturated rivers in its heartland to rivers in the ethnic-minority homelands the CPC annexed, China’s economically and culturally marginalized communities will suffer the most.
And there is little doubt that this will happen.
The CPC has now set its sights on building the world’s first super-dam, on the Yarlung Zangbo river – better known as the Brahmaputra – near Tibet’s heavily militarized border with India.
The Brahmaputra curves around the Himalayas in a U-turn and forms the planet’s longest and deepest canyon, as it plunges from an altitude of 2,800 meters (9,200 feet) toward the Indian floodplains.
Damming it means building at an elevation of more than 1,500 meters – the highest at which a mega-dam has ever been built.
And because the gorge holds the world’s largest untapped concentration of river energy, the super-dam is supposed to have a hydropower generating capacity of 60 GW, nearly three times that of the Three Gorges Dam.
The fact that the gorge is one of the world’s most biodiverse regions seems to be of little concern to the CPC, which is far more interested in being able to use water as a weapon against India, its Asian rival.
China has already set the stage for construction, recently completing a highway through the canyon and announcing the start of high-speed train service to a military town near the gorge.
This will enable the transport of heavy equipment, materials, and workers to the remote region, which was long thought inaccessible because of its treacherous terrain.
The CPC views its centenary as cause for celebration.
But the rest of the world should see the party for what it is: repressive, genocidal, and environmentally rapacious.
And it should prepare for what the CPC’s second century may bring.

An IMF We Can Love?
CAMBRIDGE – What a difference the crisis has made for the International Monetary Fund.
It was just a few months ago that this important but unloved institution, a landmark of post-war global economic arrangements, seemed destined to irrelevance.
The IMF has long been a whipping boy for both left and right – the former because of the Fund’s emphasis on fiscal rectitude and economic orthodoxy, and the latter because of its role in bailing out indebted nations.
Developing nations grudgingly took its advice, while advanced nations, not needing the money, ignored it.
In a world where private capital flows dwarf the resources at its disposal, the IMF had come to seem an anachronism.
And, when some of the IMF’s largest debtors (Brazil and Argentina) began to prepay their debts a few years ago with no new borrowers in sight, it looked like the final nail in the coffin had been struck.
The IMF seemed condemned to run out of income, in addition to losing its raison d’être. It shrank its budgets and began to downsize, and, while it was handed some new responsibilities in the meantime – surveillance over “currency manipulation,” in particular – its deliberations proved largely irrelevant.
But the crisis has invigorated the IMF.
Under its capable managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Fund has been one of the few official agencies ahead of – instead of behind – the curve. It moved quickly to establish a fast-disbursing emergency line of credit for countries with “reasonable” policies.
It ardently championed global fiscal stimulus on the order of 2% of world GNP – a position that is all the more remarkable in view of its traditional conservatism on all fiscal matters.
And, in the run-up to the G-20 summit in London, it thoroughly overhauled its lending policies, de-emphasizing traditional conditionality and making it easier for countries to qualify for loans.
Even more significantly, the IMF has emerged from the London meeting with substantially greater resources, as well as new responsibilities.
The G-20 promised to triple the Fund’s lending capacity (from $250 billion to $750 billion), issue $250 billion of new Special Drawing Rights (a reserve asset made up of a basket of major currencies), and permit the Fund to borrow in capital markets (which it has never done) if necessary. The IMF was also designated as one of two lead agencies – along with an expanded Financial Stability Forum (now renamed the Financial Stability Board) – charged with providing early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and issuing the requisite policy recommendations.
Another piece of good news is that the Europeans have now given up their claim on naming the IMF’s managing director (as have the Americans their corresponding claim on the World Bank presidency).
These senior officials are henceforth to be selected “through an open, transparent, and merit-based selection process.”
This will provide for better governance (although Strauss-Kahn’s leadership has been exemplary), and will enhance both institutions’ legitimacy in the eyes of developing nations.
So the IMF now finds itself at the center of the economic universe once again.
How will it choose to deploy its newfound power?
The greatest risk is that it will once again over-reach and over-play its hand.
That is what happened in the second half of the 1990’s, as the IMF began to preach capital-account liberalization, applied over-stringent fiscal remedies during the Asian financial crisis, and single-handedly tried to reshape Asian economies.
The institution has since acknowledged its errors in all these areas.
But it remains to be seen if the lessons have been fully internalized, and whether we will have a kinder, gentler IMF in lieu of a rigid, doctrinaire one.
One encouraging fact is that developing countries will almost certainly get a larger say in how the Fund is run.
This will ensure that poorer nations’ views receive a more sympathetic hearing in the future.
But simply giving developing nations greater voting power will make little difference if the IMF’s organizational culture is not changed as well. The Fund is staffed by a large number of smart economists, who lack much connection to (and appreciation for) the institutional realities of the countries on which they work.
Their professional expertise is validated by the quality of their advanced degrees, rather than by their achievements in practical policymaking.
This breeds arrogance and a sense of smug superiority over their counterparts – policymakers who must balance multiple, complicated agendas.
Countering this will require proactive efforts by the IMF’s top leadership in recruitment, staffing, and promotion.
One option would be to increase substantially the number of mid-career recruits with actual practical experience in developing countries.
This would make the IMF staff more cognizant of the value of local knowledge relative to theoretical expertise.
Another strategy would be to relocate some of the staff, including those in functional departments, to “regional offices” in the field.
This move would likely face considerable resistance from staff who have gotten used to the perks of Washington, DC.
But there is no better way to appreciate the role of context than to live in it. The World Bank, which engaged in a similar decentralization a while back, has become better at serving its clients as a result (without facing difficulties in recruiting top talent).
This is an important moment for the IMF.
The international community is putting great store in the Fund’s judgment and performance.
The Fund will require internal reforms to earn that trust fully.

Education in the Digital Age
TOKYO – The Fourth Industrial Revolution stands out from its predecessors in a critical way: rather than making it easier for humans to use their surroundings more effectively for their own benefit, technology is displacing humans in the workplace.
The question is who will benefit now.
Automated or otherwise technology-enabled services can increase profit margins for companies, while representing for users cheaper, more convenient, or more reliable options than those produced exclusively by humans.
But, of course, this comes at a high cost for the humans who previously filled those roles.
People all over the world have embraced ridesharing and transportation services like Uber, to the detriment of traditional taxi drivers.
When artificial intelligence-enabled driverless cars become cost-effective and reliable, Uber and taxi drivers alike will become obsolete.
In stock trading, 79% of market transactions are now performed by software, according to Frank Zhang of the Yale School of Management, reflecting the hope that machines will be able to identify patterns more effectively than a human could – a hope that may have contributed to the recent stock-market correction.
In any case, this doesn’t bode well for human traders.
I myself have saved on translation costs since realizing that, with some edits by me, Google Translate can work just fine, though this means lost income for the graduate students whom I used to hire the task.
While simultaneous interpreters – who occupy a high-paid profession – may scoff at the notion that machines will threaten their positions any time soon, the success of machine learning in highly complex strategic games like Go suggests that machines’ ability to learn should not be underestimated.
In short, the AI-driven revolution will have its winners and losers.
To win, it is vital not just to avoid being displaced by new technologies, but also to capitalize on the new opportunities they present.
This might mean investing in cutting-edge businesses like Uber, as the Japanese-Korean industrialist Masayoshi Son has done.
Or it might mean acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to secure a job that takes advantage of this new economy.
Such responses are good not just for individuals, but also for economies as a whole.
In Japan, for example, human-capital development is crucial to support growth as the population ages and shrinks. And that process begins early: as the Nobel laureate economist James Heckman has shown, education of young children has a significant impact on productivity.
That is why Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced that half of the extra revenues raised from the consumption-tax hike that will go into effect in 2019 will be invested in pre-school education.
To give young people the tools they will need to thrive in the changing digital economy, such investment must focus on improving the quality of education.
That may mean transforming curricula to focus less on rote learning or straightforward calculation and more on skills like critical thinking, communication, and leadership.
Education in Japan today – and perhaps also in South Korea – is something like the game “Jeopardy”: the one who knows the most facts is the winner.
The best-known means by which Japanese students are ranked is hensachi – literally translated as “standard deviation” – which reflects how far from the statistical mean a typical student admitted to a given institution scores on a test focused on memorized formulas and facts.
Students with higher positive hensachi scores are admitted to more rigorous high schools and colleges, where they are often encouraged to study medicine, simply because the entrance exam is difficult, even if they have no interest in a medical career.
Otherwise, they compete to become bureaucrats at the most influential ministries – for example, finance, economy, or foreign affairs – or they try to get on the fast track to the top of elite firms like Toyota or Sony.
Hensachi scores thus determine people’s entire career trajectories.
High scores mean a comfortable life, all the way through retirement.
Given this, Japanese students feel pressured to memorize information from a very young age.
Parents will go so far as to move to a district where the kindergarten is linked to a renowned university.
This system did not begin in Japan.
On the contrary, it is an outgrowth of the system for assessing and promoting Chinese bureaucrats that prevailed until the early twentieth century.While it is a form of meritocracy, and thus superior to nepotism, it fails to take into account the reality that a capacity for rote learning does not necessarily imply an aptitude for creativity or ingenuity.
Even if it did, we might not find out, because memorizing enough information to secure high scores on assessments leaves little time to learn to think – to develop skills or foster talents that could amount to a real contribution to one’s community and country.
In fact, a system based on hensachi actively discourages those who do have valuable talents from developing them into useful skills.
Yet, in the age of AI, those talents and skills are more valuable than ever.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution will amount to a major test for a Japanese education system focused on reciting facts and performing formulaic calculations – precisely the areas where humans cannot compete with intelligent machines.
With all of our technological developments, human ingenuity and creativity remain unmatched.
We should make the most of that, and give our young people the opportunity to use their innate advantages as effectively as possible.

The West’s Broken Promises on Education Aid
NEW YORK – The Global Partnership for Education, a worthy and capable initiative to promote education in 65 low-income countries, is having what the jargon of development assistance calls a “replenishment round,” meaning that it is asking donor governments to refill its coffers.
Yet the fact that the GPE is begging for mere crumbs – a mere $1 billion per year – exposes the charade of Western governments’ commitment to the global Education for All agenda.
The United States and the European Union have never cared that much about that agenda.
When it comes to disease, they have at times been willing to invest to slow or stop epidemics like AIDS, malaria, and Ebola, both to save lives and to prevent the diseases from coming to their own countries.
But when it comes to education, many countries in the West are more interested in building walls and detention camps than schools.
The GPE does excellent work promoting primary education around the world.
Donor countries, all of which long ago signed on to Education for All, should be clamoring to help one of the world’s most effective organizations to achieve that goal.
Yet generous donors are few and far between.
This reality extends back to imperial times.
When most of Africa and much of Asia were under European rule, the colonizers invested little in basic education. As late as 1950, according to United Nations data, illiteracy was pervasive in Europe’s African and Asian colonies.
At the time of independence from Britain, India’s illiteracy rate stood at 80-85%, roughly the same as Indonesia’s illiteracy rate at the time of independence from the Netherlands.
In French West Africa, the illiteracy rate in 1950 stood at 95-99%.
After independence, African and Asian countries pursued massive and largely successful initiatives to raise basic education and literacy.
Yet, far from seizing this opportunity to make up for lost time, Europe and the US have provided consistently meager assistance for primary and secondary education, even as they have made high-profile commitments such as Education for All and Sustainable Development Goal 4, which calls for universal access to pre-primary through secondary school.
Consider the grim data on development aid for education, which has stagnated for years – and actually declined between 2010 and 2015.
According to the most recent OECD data, total donor aid for primary and secondary education in Africa amounted to just $1.3 billion in 2016.
To put that figure in perspective, the US Pentagon budget is roughly $2 billion per day. With around 420 million African kids of school age, total aid amounted to roughly $3 per child per year.
It’s not as if Western governments don’t know that far more is needed.
Several detailed recent calculations provide credible estimates of how much external financing developing countries will need to achieve SDG 4. A UNESCO study puts the total at $39.5 billion per year.
A report by the International Commission on Financing Education Opportunity, led by former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, similarly put developing countries’ external financing needs at tens of billions of dollars per year.
Here is the reason why aid is needed.
A year of education in Africa requires at least $300 per student.
(Note that the rich countries spend several thousand dollars per student per year.)
With Africa’s school-age population accounting for roughly one-third of the total, the per capita financing requirement is about $100.
Yet for a typical African country, that’s about 10% of per capita national income – far more than the education budget can cover. External aid can and should cover the financing gap so that all children can attend school.
That’s not happening.
Annual spending per school-aged child in Sub-Saharan Africa is roughly one-third of the minimum needed.
As a result, most kids don’t come anywhere close to finishing secondary school.
They are forced to drop out early, because there are no openings in public schools and tuition for private school is far too high for most families.
Girls are especially likely to leave school early, though parents know that all of their children need and deserve a quality education.
Without the skills that a secondary education provides, the children who leave school early are condemned to poverty.
Many eventually try to migrate to Europe in desperate search of a livelihood.
Some drown on the way; others are caught by European patrols and returned to Africa.
So now comes the GPE’s replenishment round, scheduled for early February in Senegal.
The GPE should be receiving at least $10 billion a year (about four days’ military spending by the NATO countries) to put Africa on a path toward universal secondary education.
Instead, the GPE is reportedly still begging donors for less than $1 billion per year to cover GPE programs all over the world.
Instead of actually solving the education crisis, rich-country leaders go from speech to speech, meeting to meeting, proclaiming their ardent love of education for all.
Across Africa, political, religious, and civil-society leaders are doing what they can. Ghana has recently announced free upper-secondary education for all, setting the pace for the continent.
As African countries struggle to fund their ambitious commitments, new partners, including private companies and high-net-worth individuals, should step forward to help them.
Traditional donors, for their part, have decades of lost time to make up for.
The quest for education will not be stopped, but history will judge harshly those who turn their backs on children in need.

The Global Age of Complexity
NEW YORK – Every century, it seems, has its “age.”
The Renaissance, from a philosophical perspective, has been called the Age of Adventure.
The seventeenth-century Age of Reason was followed by the Age of Enlightenment.
The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were ages of ideology and analysis, respectively.
As for the twenty-first century, I would argue that it is the Age of Complexity.
On the one hand, science and technology have progressed to the point that humans can create life and, through ultra-advanced genome-editing technologies, even engineer new species.
Futurologist Yuval Noah Harari anticipates the imminent rise of Homo deus: a species of humanity that can “play god” by manipulating nature in myriad ways, including delaying and ultimately even conquering death. Most of the technological trends identified by the US Department of Defense as crucial in the coming years were unheard of just 30 years ago.
On the other hand, much of humanity is besieged by feelings of helplessness and frustration, owing to the challenges we seem unable to resolve, from pollution and climate change to unrelenting radicalism and terrorism.
Economic inequality – reinforced by job losses from automation, deeply entrenched social orders, and damaging political power dynamics – has contributed substantially to this sense of powerlessness.
At a time when our power of creation, matched by our power of destruction, has reached unprecedented levels – when one weapons launch could change the course of history – the development of a more equitable and effective system could not be more urgent.
In this new age of complexity, we need a new paradigm for thinking about the world, and thus for guiding our efforts to advance peace and prosperity.
A prevailing worldview has always been essential to shaping human destiny.
Alexander the Great would not have conquered most of the known world of his time without the influence of his philosopher-teacher Aristotle.
And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.
(Were history written by the victims, not the victors, empire-building would look a lot less glorious.)
As we move to develop a new worldview to guide our future, we must embrace a truly global perspective.
In the past, analysis of the evolution of humanity’s worldview has tended to focus on the West, following the European and, later, American progression from exploration, colonization, and empire-building, to industrialization, the diffusion of market relations, and technological innovation.
In the twenty-first century, however, this narrative is being revised.
The global economic crisis that originated in the United States in 2007 exposed the fragility of the advanced-country model, giving rise to a new, more multipolar worldview, in which the emerging economies, led by China, India, and Russia, have increasingly challenged the status quo.
Meanwhile, the challenges countries are facing have become increasingly interconnected, with global mega-trends, from climate change to financialization, playing out beyond the purview of individual governments.
As the physicist-turned-ecologist Fritjof Capra and the chemist Pier Luigi Luisi remarked in their 2014 book The Systems View of Life, “the major problems of our time are systemic problems – all interconnected and interdependent.”
Accordingly, “they require systemic solutions.”
In this context, the world needs a more holistic worldview that accepts the pluralism and diversity – in terms of geography, tradition, and governance models – that reflect and reinforce the complexity of today’s global trends.
Such an approach must recognize not just the need for countries to work together to shape the world, but also the limits of our ability to shape it at all.
Humanity has long operated within a paradigm of determinism; we believe we can predict and manipulate outcomes.
But we have not discovered any natural laws or equations that explain how life evolved into its current state, much less indicate how it will evolve in the future.
Determinism has run its course, and must be replaced by a paradigm in which uncertainty is accepted as an irreducible fact of life.
In the natural sciences, this is already happening.
Quantum mechanics, general relativity, and uncertainty have been accepted as the way forward in physics and mathematics.
In biology and neuroscience, there is a growing acceptance that life emerges through cognition (self-awareness and self-generation) and changes constantly, meaning that there is no “prestatable becoming,” in the words of the biologist Stuart Kauffman.
Yet in the social sciences – from economics to politics – this transition has yet to take place.
Economics continues to operate in a largely linear manner, guided by the deterministic eighteenth-century Newtonian framework.
But simple mechanistic theories cannot deal with living, complex, and often quantum systems.
Indeed, the reductionist logic, based on simplistic assumptions, that dominates economics today is at best incomplete, and potentially fundamentally wrong.
Similarly, in politics, we continue to struggle to reach systemic solutions, not least because we often cannot agree on the nature of the complex problem we face.
This partly reflects the global nature of today’s challenges and the diversity of perspectives that therefore must be reconciled.
More fundamentally, it reflects the fact that humans are not always rational – a fact that a new “complexity economics” would do more to acknowledge.
More broadly, a new “complexity worldview” must appreciate that human behavior is driven by everything from politics and economics to culture and psychology – even by technology itself.
In an age of complexity, the institutions we build and sustain demand a system-minded approach that evolves alongside the rapidly progressing natural sciences.

Islam’s Forsaken Renaissance
Children often play a game where they sit in a circle.
One whispers something to his neighbor, who then whispers that information to the next child, and so on, around the circle.
By the time the last child whispers the information to the first, it is totally different from what was originally said.
Something like that seems to have happened within Islam.
The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, brought one – and only one – religion.
Yet today we have perhaps a thousand religions that all claim to be Islam.
Divided by their different interpretations, Muslims do not play the role they once did in the world; instead, they are weakened and victimized.
The Shia/Sunni schism is so deep that each side condemns followers of the other as apostates, kafir.
The belief that the other’s religion is not Islam, and its followers not Muslim, has underpinned internecine wars in which millions have died – and continue to die.
Even among the Sunnis and Shias there are further divisions.
The Sunnis have four imams and the Shias have twelve; their teachings all differ.
Then there are other divisions, including the Druze, the Alawites, and the Wahabis.
We are also taught by our ulamas (religious instructors) that their teachings must not be questioned.
Islam is a faith.
It must be believed.
Logic and reason play no part in it.
But what is it that we must believe when each branch of Islam thinks the other one is wrong?
The Koran, after all, is one book, not two or three, or a thousand.
According to the Koran, a Muslim is anyone who bears witness that “there is no God (Allah) but Allah, and that Muhammad is his Rasul (Messenger).”
If no other qualification is added, then all those who subscribe to these precepts must be regarded as Muslims.
But because we Muslims like to add qualifications that often derive from sources other than the Koran, our religion’s unity has been broken.
But perhaps the greatest problem is the progressive isolation of Islamic scholarship – and much of Islamic life – from the rest of the modern world.
We live in an age of science in which people can see around corners, hear and see things happening in outer space, and clone animals.
And all of these things seem to contradict our belief in the Koran.
This is so because those who interpret the Koran are learned only in religion, in its laws and practices, and thus are usually unable to understand today’s scientific miracles.
The fatwas (legal opinions concerning Islamic law) that they issue appear unreasonable and cannot be accepted by those with scientific knowledge.
One learned religious teacher, for example, refused to believe that a man had landed on the moon.
Others assert that the world was created 2,000 years ago.
The age of the universe and its size measured in light years – these are things that the purely religiously trained ulamas cannot comprehend.
This failure is largely responsible for the sad plight of so many Muslims.
Today’s oppression, the killings and the humiliations of Muslims, occurs because we are weak, unlike the Muslims of the past.
We can feel victimized and criticize the oppressors, but to stop them we need to look at ourselves.
We must change for our own good.
We cannot ask our detractors to change, so that Muslims benefit.
So what do we need to do?
In the past, Muslims were strong because they were learned.
Muhammad’s injunction was to read, but the Koran does not say what to read.
Indeed, there was no “Muslim scholarship” at the time, so to read meant to read whatever was available.
The early Muslims read the works of the great Greek scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers.
They also studied the works of the Persians, the Indians, and the Chinese.
The result was a flowering of science and mathematics.
Muslim scholars added to the body of knowledge and developed new disciplines, such as astronomy, geography, and new branches of mathematics.
They introduced numerals, enabling simple and limitless calculations.
But around the fifteenth century, the learned in Islam began to curb scientific study.
They began to study religion alone, insisting that only those who study religion – particularly Islamic jurisprudence – gain merit in the afterlife.
The result was intellectual regression at the very moment that Europe began embracing scientific and mathematical knowledge.
And so, as Muslims were intellectually regressing, Europeans began their renaissance, developing improved ways of meeting their needs, including the manufacture of weapons that eventually allowed them to dominate the world.
By contrast, Muslims fatally weakened their ability to defend themselves by neglecting, even rejecting, the study of allegedly secular science and mathematics, and this myopia remains a fundamental source of the oppression suffered by Muslims today.
Many Muslims still condemn the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kamal, because he tried to modernize his country.
But would Turkey be Muslim today without Ataturk? Mustafa Kamal’s clear-sightedness saved Islam in Turkey and saved Turkey for Islam.
Failure to understand and interpret the true and fundamental message of the Koran has brought only misfortune to Muslims.
By limiting our reading to religious works and neglecting modern science, we destroyed Islamic civilization and lost our way in the world.
The Koran says that “Allah will not change our unfortunate situation unless we make the effort to change it.”
Many Muslims continue to ignore this and, instead, merely pray to Allah to save us, to bring back our lost glory.
But the Koran is not a talisman to be hung around the neck for protection against evil.
Allah helps those who improve their minds.

The Unsustainability of Organic Farming
STANFORD – “Sustainable” has become one of the buzzwords of the twenty-first century.
Increasing numbers of universities offer courses or even programs in “sustainability,” and many large companies boast substantial departments devoted to the subject.
In April, many of the iconic multinational companies in the agriculture/food sector were represented at a three-day “Sustainable Product Expo,” convened by Wal-Mart – the largest retailer in the United States – at its Arkansas headquarters.
But, as with many vague, feel-good concepts, “sustainability” contains more than a little sophistry.
For example, sustainability in agriculture is often linked to organic farming, whose advocates tout it as a “sustainable” way to feed the planet’s rapidly expanding population.
But what does “sustainable” really mean, and how does it relate to organic methods of food production?
The organic movement’s claims about the sustainability of its methods are dubious.
For example, a recent study found that the potential for groundwater contamination can be dramatically reduced if fertilizers are distributed through the irrigation system according to plant demand during the growing season; organic farming, however, depends on compost, the release of which is not matched to plant demand.
Moreover, though composting receives good press as a “green” practice, it generates a significant amount of greenhouse gases (and is often a source of pathogenic bacteria in crops).
The study also found that “intensive organic agriculture relying on solid organic matter, such as composted manure that is mixed in to the soil prior to planting, resulted in significant down-leaching of nitrate” into groundwater.
Increasing the nitrate levels in groundwater is hardly a hallmark of sustainability, especially with many of the world’s most fertile farming regions in the throes of drought.
A fundamental reason that organic food production is far less “sustainable” than many forms of conventional farming is that organic farms, though possibly well adapted for certain local environments on a small scale, produce far less food per unit of land and water. The low yields of organic agriculture – typically 20-50% below conventional agriculture – impose various stresses on farmland, especially on water consumption.
A British meta-analysis published in 2012 identified some of the stresses that were higher in organic agriculture.
For example, it found that “ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching, and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems,” as were “land use, eutrophication potential, and acidification potential per product unit.”
Lower crop yields in organic farming are largely inevitable, owing to the arbitrary rejection of various advanced methods and technologies. Organic practices afford limited pesticide options, create difficulties in meeting peak fertilizer demand, and rule out access to genetically engineered varieties.
If organic production were scaled up significantly, the lower yields would lead to greater pressure to convert land to agricultural use and produce more animals for manure, to say nothing of the tighter squeeze on water supplies – all of which are challenges to sustainability.
Another limitation of organic production is that it works against the best approach to enhancing soil quality – namely, the minimization of soil disturbance (such as that caused by plowing or tilling), combined with the use of cover crops.
Such farming systems have many environmental advantages, particularly with respect to limiting erosion and the runoff of fertilizers and pesticides. Organic growers do frequently plant cover crops, but in the absence of effective herbicides, they often rely on tillage (or even labor-intensive hand weeding) for weed control.
At the same time, organic producers do use insecticides and fungicides to protect their crops, despite the green myth that they do not.
More than 20 chemicals (mostly containing copper and sulfur) are commonly used in growing and processing organic crops – all acceptable under US rules for certifying organic products.
Perhaps the most illogical and least sustainable aspect of organic farming in the long term is the exclusion of “genetically engineered” (also known as “genetically modified,” or GM) plants – but only those that were modified with the most precise techniques and predictable results.
Except for wild berries and wild mushrooms, virtually all the fruits, vegetables, and grains in European and North American diets have been genetically improved by one technique or another – often as a result of seeds being irradiated or undergoing hybridizations that move genes from one species or genus to another in ways that do not occur in nature.
The exclusion from organic agriculture of organisms simply because they were crafted with modern, superior techniques makes no sense.
It not only denies farmers improved seeds, but also denies consumers of organic goods access to nutritionally improved foods, such as oils with enhanced levels of omega-3 fatty acids.
In recent decades, conventional agriculture has become more environmentally friendly and sustainable than ever before.
But that reflects science-based research and old-fashioned technological ingenuity on the part of farmers, plant breeders, and agribusiness companies, not irrational opposition to modern insecticides, herbicides, genetic engineering, and “industrial agriculture.”

The US Needs A Draft
BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA – The United States needs a new draft – but not the kind you think.
For 25 years, before retiring as the 31st Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, I proudly wore the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, the USMC’s insignia.
I faced all kinds of enemies on the battlefield, without fear or doubt, because I always believed wholeheartedly in America’s democracy and the Constitution that is its foundation.
We are losing that belief and our connection to it.
When I was a young Marine in Vietnam, during a time of deep internal division in America, about half the country’s people said they trusted their fellow Americans.
That was very discouraging.
Today, according to a recent Brookings Institution study, that number is less than one-third.
Americans’ civic discourse has all but disappeared, giving way to pessimistic apathy, blind partisanship, and un-American rage at our fellow citizens.
In our national history, when we have faced terrible times of economic hardship, civil discord, and political division, more often than not an external threat brought us back together.
Today, however, that threat is internal, and it is a lot harder to identify.
But the effects are clear – a fundamental weakening of the bonds that unite us as Americans.
I am not a Democrat or a Republican.
I am an American, and my life has been guided by a clear and simple oath: to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
We have the world’s greatest military, and while foreign threats are real, I know our service members can handle them.
It is the domestic threats that we must address.
It is time to institute a new draft to create a national force of young men and women to serve our country’s critical domestic needs, while instilling in them a greater appreciation of our democracy and how it functions. Our government should establish a mandatory, two-year, paid national service program that would bring together Americans of different backgrounds and help break down geographic, racial, ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic barriers to a deeply felt and widely shared civic identity.
Unlike AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps, the two best-known existing federal US service programs, priorities should be defined at the state and local level, because they differ widely across the country. The federal government should launch a block-grant program for each state to decide where an army of young men and women could best address its communities’ most urgent social needs.
Such needs might include assistance for the homeless and military veterans; mentoring students in poorly performing schools; regional crisis forces to improve responses to natural disasters; a program, modeled on the New Deal-era Works Progress Administration, to re-build local infrastructure like bridges and roads and clean up waterways and parks; and rural health initiatives to address critical nursing shortages, confront opioid addiction, and care for the elderly.
And, to broaden young Americans’ perspectives on issues facing communities beyond their own, half of each state’s draftees should carry out their service in another state.
All draftees should begin their service with a 12-week training period similar to what we do in the military, with a curriculum focused on teaching self-discipline, accountability, teamwork, and physical fitness.
We should create a program for retirees from service professions to become mentor-instructors to these young national service recruits.
Americans are living longer, have less retirement resources as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and have great experience and wisdom that would benefit our youth.
Moreover, as both the military and our college system downsize, there are vacant facilities in every state where such training could take place, putting to use what might otherwise become derelict infrastructure.
We should also design a modern equivalent of the successful post-World War II GI Bill for our young men and women when they finish their service. Benefits could range from subsidized mortgages and low-interest loans to start a business to partial school tuition, subsidies for living expenses, and accelerated debt forgiveness.
According to a 2018 Public Opinion Strategies poll, about two-thirds of Americans would support a national service program.
And it would be good policy: alumni of existing service programs go on to complete four-year college at much higher rates than their non-service peers.
Most important, such a program would go a long way toward bridging Americans’ differences.
If our young people grow up believing that theirs is a divided country, we will have destroyed our future.
But if they can help unify our country, then our best days will be yet to come.
There is no more important challenge.

Mapping a Better Future for Africa’s Farmers
LUSAKA – Global positioning system (GPS) technology was originally developed to track nuclear submarines during the Cold War.
For years, it has helped to prevent drivers everywhere from getting lost.
Today, GPS tools have the potential to document the land of millions of subsistence farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa, thus protecting them from possible land grabs and removing a significant barrier to the region’s economic development.
Armed with GPS-enabled tablets or smartphones, local and international NGOs and African governments are mapping the property lines of everything from clam farms in Ghana to cotton fields in Zambia.
Funding for this work comes from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), and national treasuries.
These efforts address one of the most pernicious and disastrous bottlenecks in agricultural development.
The World Bank estimates that only 10% of rural land tenure in Sub-Saharan Africa is documented.
Given the scale of the problem, governments, NGOs, and funders must rapidly expand this work and leverage technological innovations to provide land documentation quickly and efficiently to farmers across the region.
Typically, Africa’s family farmers either inherited their land or bought it on a handshake. In the absence of deeds or titles, land tenure often is governed by customary rules applied by local chiefs.
This can leave farmers vulnerable not only to neighbors or relatives seeking to expand their land holdings, but also to foreign investors who have turned to Africa in search of cheap farmland, often unaware that local communities are already using it.
As a result, many Sub-Saharan African farmers become trapped in a cycle of poverty and conflict.
Investors can’t determine from whom they can obtain vacant land, neighbors can’t agree on property lines, and siblings squabble over inheritances.
This constant conflict and insecurity makes farmers like Jonathan Tembo reluctant to invest in their land to improve their harvests.
Tembo, headman of the village of Masili in eastern Zambia, says he and his neighbors have always planted maize – not because the crop will improve their children’s diet or boost their income, but because it is planted first after the rains.
“If I waited to plant soybeans or sweet potato, which would bring me more money at harvest time, someone would see my empty land and plant it for themselves,” Tembo says.
“We have always farmed like this – with fear in our hearts.”
Many African governments recognize that insecure land tenure undermines efforts to achieve food security, improve nutrition, and spur rural development.
But they have traditionally lacked the capacity or will to undertake the monumental task of hiring an army of surveyors to fan out across the country and document every farmer’s land.
Moreover, the region lacks enough trained land surveyors to meet demand. Without digital technologies, it would take Uganda’s few dozen surveyors more than 1,000 years to document the 15 million land parcels in that country.
GPS-enabled smartphones are a potential game changer, because they can document property lines quickly and efficiently without having to rely on scarce surveyors.
Indigenous tribes in Latin America, Asia, and Africa started using this technology about a decade ago to map and protect vast stretches of ancestral lands, and GPS-based initiatives have expanded over the last seven years in particular.
This reflects several developments: commercially available GPS technology became accurate enough to measure smaller parcels, GPS devices became more affordable, and smartphones allowed for better data collection and processing in the field.
In addition, land-tenure advocates developed and tested systems to help validate and manage the large amount of data created by mapping just a single village’s land holdings.
USAID, for example, has developed a suite of low-cost tools that build on these innovations and pair them with community engagement.
“USAID and a few other donors see the documentation of land rights as a key hurdle that has been holding back millions of families across dozens of countries,” says David Arnaldo Mijan, who leads the agency’s environment division team within the USAID/Zambia Economic Development Office.
“Documenting land improves nutrition, reduces conflict and poverty, empowers women economically, and allows families and communities to become more self-sufficient.”
Other funders should take note.
USAID and DFID have robust land-documentation programs that rely on similar approaches.
These include educating community members about land rights and the benefits of documentation, and engaging them to help manage the process.
In Tembo’s village of Masili, for example, members of each of the 75 households walked the boundaries of their land with witnesses and local leaders, noting the GPS coordinates.
This enabled them to create a digital map of their village within a few days at a cost of about $20 per parcel. Making such a map with trained land surveyors would have taken years and cost hundreds of dollars per parcel.
Once Masili’s residents documented their land, conflicts over farm boundaries stopped, prompting farmers to invest in higher-value crops.
Women in the community, who previously were at risk of being pushed off their farms if their husbands died, now have documents that they can use to defend their rights in court.
Research demonstrates that strengthening women’s land tenure boosts their economic standing, improves family nutrition, and bolsters their children’s education.
The ripple effect from documenting land rights should have donors and governments’ attention.
GPS-enabled smartphones provide an unprecedented opportunity for governments, funders, and NGOs to collaborate with local communities to document their land rights.
By mapping the soil they work, farmers can chart a path to a better future.

When France Says No
Not long ago, an American political analyst compared France’s loss of influence in Europe following its “No” vote in the 2005 referendum on the EU constitutional treaty with France’s surrender in 1940.
A provocative analogy, but is it apt?
The collapse in 1940 revealed the fragility of France’s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country’s capacity to face outside threats.
In rejecting the European constitution, France expressed its fear of, among other things, globalization.
A better analogy for the No vote was the rejection in 1954 of the treaty to establish a European Defense Community (EDC).
In both cases, a major historical mistake was made.
France had to a large extent initiated both treaties, had managed to get them accepted by its European partners, but in the end vetoed its own undertakings.
Why, in both 1954 and 2005, did the French – in one case the National Assembly, in the other the electorate – reject proposals that France itself had conceived? Both projects sought to construct a genuinely supranational Europe.
The EDC would have created a European army, in which even German troops would have been included.
The proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments.
In effect, this commission would have been the precursor to the 2003-2004 Convention for the Future of Europe, which, presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing drafted the constitutional treaty.
The political community of the 1950’s that France had persuaded its five European partners to accept was supposed to absorb both the European Coal and Steel Community and the EDC.
It was to have both diplomatic and military powers, as well as a legislative assembly much like today’s European Parliament – just as the 2005 EU constitutional plan would have extended the European Parliament’s powers and created a European minister of foreign affairs.
But now, as back then, fear and doubt won the day.
Political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France’s sovereignty.
Today, those in France who opposed the EU constitution succeeded in stigmatizing “Europe” as the threat.
They trumpeted France’s invasion by “Polish plumbers,” calling into question Europe’s two principal achievements: the introduction of a single market, which has undeniably boosted the French economy, and EU enlargement, which has done so much to foster democratic transition in new member states.
But the failure of the referendum in France carries more serious consequences than the EDC’s rejection. Back in the 1950’s, the founding nations’ foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague, Paul-Henri Spaak, for fresh proposals.
After intensive discussion among the six, and especially between France and Germany, the Treaty of Rome was drawn up and signed within two years of the EDC debacle.
By contrast, two years after the French and Dutch No votes, there is no sign of a Plan B, despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobilize the No vote.
Europe’s Franco-German locomotive has broken down and ratification has stopped, even though member states that had yet to ratify the treaty could have completed the process of ratification.
France’s loss of influence in Europe is no longer at stake today, because the notion of influence presupposes that the overriding preoccupation of EU member states is to advance their own national interests.
If Europe were only about gaining the upper hand, it would generate perpetual conflict.
The reality is that Europe does manage to move ahead, but step by step through mutual compromise.
The real question has more to do with France’s credibility and its capacity to remain a driving force in Europe.
A journalist recently expressed the view that France’s special role in Europe was due to its “centrality,” meaning that the French are, in equal measure, both open to the world and attached to their nation.
They also participate successfully in a market economy while seeking to preserve an egalitarian social model.
The No vote sullied this image of a balanced France.
Indeed, the French themselves are among the first to lament their bleak situation, inventing a new concept – “la déclinologie” – to describe this loss of self–confidence.
Moreover, the No vote has given a new legitimacy to euro-skepticism in other member states. To be sure, the rise of populism in Europe was not caused by the French; nationalism is deeply rooted in Europe’s history and has many causes.
But France’s referendum result fueled other European governments’ fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re-launch the EU constitution would fail in the face of domestic and Europe-wide opposition.
But reducing European aspirations to the goals of Realpolitik is no answer to today’s crisis.
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity, and that Europe’s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity.
Until we think in terms of European sovereignty, rather than fret over risks to national sovereignty, the present crisis cannot be overcome.

China’s Global Climate Boost
BEIJING – In his video address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a slight improvement of China’s 2015 Paris climate agreement pledge: national carbon dioxide emissions should now peak before 2030 rather than around 2030.
That might not seem like much, but, paired with Xi’s additional declaration that China aims to be carbon neutral before 2060, the address sent positive shock waves through the climate-policy world.
Decades of impressive GDP growth have made China the world’s second-largest economy, bigger than the next three (Japan, Germany, and India) combined.
But the outside world still often associates China with coal dependence, rising CO2 emissions, and polluted air – and rightly so.
China is thus arguably the modern era’s first “hybrid” superpower: a global leader that does not yet have a fully advanced economy.
And Xi’s two-phase climate pledge reflects how the Chinese themselves see their hybrid status.
The country’s more modest climate ambitions up to 2030 reflect the persistence of its people’s developing-country mentality.
After all, many Chinese, and especially the current leadership, still vividly remember growing up in a poor, backward country.
But with China expected to become a high-income country by 2030, that mindset is giving way to a “rising superpower” mentality, which helps to explain why China aims to become carbon neutral just ten years after the European Union.
Granted, China’s new 2060 climate target is currently only an ambition, not a legislated policy.
But future administrations are expected to take Xi’s pledge seriously.
The scale of the task cannot be understated.
China now aims to eliminate some ten billion tons of annual CO2 emissions – nearly a third of the global total – from 2030 onward, equivalent to decarbonizing the entire French economy every year for 30 years.
Sooner or later, China will have little choice but to double down on its climate mitigation efforts in all sectors, particularly energy, industry, transport, and agriculture.
But there is reason to be optimistic about China’s prospects for a successful green transition.
As the world’s largest clean-energy market, the country accounts for more than one-third of the world’s installed wind and solar capacity, and (at the end of 2019) nearly half of all electric vehicles.
Moreover, China’s impressive record of scaling up clean-energy technologies means that its recent net-zero emissions pledge should further boost the ongoing low-carbon revolution around the world.
For example, if China decides to raise its hydrogen-economy ambition, it is hard to imagine that the EU, Japan, South Korea, and other major advanced economies would not follow suit in order to maintain their competitiveness.
Of course, 2060 is a long way off, so the world will be watching eagerly to see whether Xi’s pledge is translated into concrete measures in China’s upcoming 14th Five-Year Plan, covering the 2021-25 period.
Optimizing investments across the Chinese energy sector by 2060 requires national CO2 emissions to peak sooner rather than later.
But China’s leadership – especially provincial governors – may struggle to balance this long-term strategic interest against the short-term economic gains from carbon-intensive investments.
The international community – and the EU in particular – could help China to move forward by engaging it in a coalition of the willing for climate action.
This group could also include Japan and South Korea, whose pledges to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 cover all greenhouse gases.
Chinese climate policy would benefit from such a global effort.
China’s recent announcement notably omitted any mention of the country’s overseas investments, not least in countries participating in Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative of transnational infrastructure projects.
China has so far channeled much of its BRI investment into fossil-fuel projects, although the BRI has started investing more in renewables.
That said, BRI investments are the host country’s responsibility as well as China’s, so greening the initiative’s investments requires a push from both sides – if not a global one.
Encouragingly, Joe Biden’s victory in the recent US presidential election may herald a reversal of the ongoing deglobalization trend, which might not only stabilize a rules-based international order, but also boost investment in sustainable infrastructure in many parts of the world.
But the United States, the world’s largest economy and the second-biggest CO2 emitter, is the elephant in the room – and Xi doubtless made his climate pledge with America in mind. By joining the Paris agreement, China helped President Barack Obama leave a legacy on climate policy, in exchange for less contentious Sino-American relations.
But although Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris agreement on day one of his administration, China’s leaders sense that the US now has little appetite to work together on climate issues.
In other words, China has drastically and unilaterally upgraded its long-term climate ambitions without asking America (or the EU, for that matter) for anything in return.
In doing so, it has thrown its weight firmly behind the policies that the EU has embraced and put Biden in an awkward position.
With the American public divided and climate science politicized, rejoining the Paris accord will not by itself make the US a reliable player in international climate politics.
China, meanwhile, is the world’s largest CO2 emitter, accounting for almost 30% of the global total.
Xi’s new pledge is thus a calculated strategic move that not only surprised domestic and international audiences alike, but also significantly advanced the medium to long-term global climate agenda.
After US President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement in June 2017, the EU was briefly a lone climate leader.
China, Japan, and South Korea have now joined it, but the EU – like the others – has yet to make its climate-neutrality target legally binding.
China’s ambitious commitment has now put the ball back in Europe’s court. The EU should pick up where China left off and make its 2050 climate pledge mandatory during the German presidency, which expires at the end of 2020.

Food for Sustainable Development
NEW YORK – Feeding a planet of 7.7 billion people is no easy matter.
Every person on the planet needs, expects, and has the right to a healthy diet.
Every farmer needs, expects, and has the right to a decent livelihood.
The roughly ten million other species on the planet need a habitat in which they can survive.
And every business that produces, processes, and transports food needs and expects to earn a profit.
It’s a tall order – and it’s not being fulfilled.
Over 820 million people are chronically hungry.
Another two billion or so suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, such as a lack of vitamins or proteins.
Around 650 million adults are obese, an epidemic caused in part by ultra-processed foods that are stuffed with sugar, saturated fats, and other chemical additives.
But the problems go far beyond hunger and diet.
Today’s agro-industrial practices are the main cause of deforestation, freshwater depletion and pollution, soil erosion, and the collapse of biodiversity.
To top it off, human-induced climate change, partly caused by the food sector, is wreaking havoc on crop production.
With more warming and population growth ahead, the crisis will worsen unless decisive changes are made.
The food industry is a powerhouse of the global economy and includes some of the best-known brand names, because we connect with them every day.
Solving the many intersecting food crises will be impossible unless the food industry changes its ways.
Fortunately, there is an important glimmer of hope.
A growing number of food companies understand the challenge and want to forge a new direction that is consistent with human health and planetary survival.
We have been asked by some of these industry leaders, convened by the Barilla Foundation, to help identify the steps needed to align the food sector with sustainable development.
Our starting point is another source of hope. In 2015, all 193 members of the United Nations agreed unanimously to two vital agreements.
The first, called Agenda 2030, adopts 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a roadmap to human wellbeing and planetary safety. The second, the Paris climate agreement, commits the world’s governments to taking decisive action to keep global warming to less than 1.5º Celsius.
Both the SDGs and the Paris agreement require decisive changes in practices by the food industry.
In our report, we call on all companies in the food sector, both producers and distributors, to adopt clear guidelines, metrics, and reporting standards to align with the global goals.
Specifically, each company must address four critical questions.
First, do the companies’ products and strategies contribute to healthy and sustainable diets?
We know that the fast-food culture is literally killing us.
The industry has to change, urgently, to promote healthy diets.
Second, are the company’s production practices sustainable?
Too many companies are engaged in chemical pollution, massive waste from packaging, deforestation, excessive and poorly targeted fertilizer use, and other environmental ills.
Third, are the company’s upstream suppliers sustainable?
No consumer food company should use products from farms that contribute to deforestation.
The destruction of forests in the Amazon and Indonesia – literally a scorched-earth process – underscore the need to barcode all food products to ensure that they are sourced from sustainable farms.
Lastly, is the company a good corporate citizen?
For example, aggressive tax practices that seek to exploit legal loopholes or weak enforcement processes should be avoided, as they deprive governments of the revenues needed to promote public services and thereby achieve the SDGs.
As part of our work, we examined the food industry’s current reporting practices.
While many companies purport to pursue sustainable development, too few report on the healthfulness of their product lines or how their products contribute to healthy and sustainable dietary patterns.
Too few recognize that they are part of the environmental crisis, either directly in their own production, or as buyers of products produced in environmental hotspots such as the Amazon or Indonesia.
And companies don’t report in detail on their tax practices. In short, the food industry’s commitment to sustainability is still too often more high-minded sentiment than actual reporting and monitoring to ensure alignment with the SDGs and the Paris accord.
But we are not pessimistic.
Around the world, young people are demanding a sustainable and safe way of living and doing business.
We believe that companies, too, will change.
After all, companies need customers who are satisfied, workers who are motivated, and the respect of society as a tacit “license to do business.”
Some of the cases we analyzed give us hope that change is possible.
As our project continues in the coming year, with the aim of working with the industry to ensure that performance, reporting, and monitoring are aligned with sustainable development, we will keep the public informed of what we see and learn.
The food sector is a key part of a larger picture.
World leaders gathered at the UN this week to review progress – or lack thereof – on the SDGs and the Paris agreement.
They must keep in mind one crucial fact: the world’s people are demanding change.
We have the know-how and wealth to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, and sustainable world.
The business sector must urgently recognize, acknowledge, and act upon its global responsibilities.

The Ultimate Nuclear Test
NEW YORK – On 1 November, a team of over 35 experts will launch an exercise to inspect a simulated nuclear test site near the Dead Sea in Jordan—a step forward in completing the global verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).
Then on 12 November, the world’s Nobel Peace Laureates will hold a summit in Hiroshima to stress the priority of nuclear disarmament and affirm their commitment to promoting it.
Countless other international initiatives are also underway that reflect a wider revolution in thinking about nuclear weapons—a revolution that is welcome and long overdue.
After all, despite much talk of nuclear disarmament when the Cold War ended 20 years ago, more than 20,000 of these weapons still exist, with many on high alert, and each much larger than the devices that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Nine countries are known or believed to possess them, and all are improving them in various ways.
Let’s be clear, the very existence of these weapons aggravates three global nuclear threats – from existing arsenals (accidents, miscalculations, unauthorized use, or willful use), from their proliferation to additional states, and from their acquisition by terrorists.
But now a new global consensus is emerging that these weapons are militarily irrelevant in dealing with emerging threats, impossible to use without violating international humanitarian law, a source of proliferation and terrorist threats, and a waste of money and scientific talent.
This helps to explain why we are seeing new demands to start good-faith negotiations on nuclear disarmament, as has long been required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made a persuasive case for work to begin on a nuclear-weapons convention, or a framework of separate agreements resulting in a global ban.
Even the leaders of the nuclear-weapon states are now officially supporting the goal of global nuclear disarmament.
They are joined by former statesmen, national parliaments and regional organizations, mayors, retired military experts, women’s organizations, human rights activists, environmentalists, and countless other groups worldwide.
Yes, nuclear disarmament has gone viral.
It is now mainstream – a fitting subject for even die-hard realists to consider and no longer a cause promoted by peace groups alone.
We believe that this momentum is absolutely vital to international peace and security, and there are many ways to reinforce it.
Achieving global nuclear disarmament will surely require new legal obligations for all states, nuclear and non-nuclear.
To be blunt, the rule of law must be brought to disarmament. Commitments in this sensitive field must be made irreversible and subject to strict verification.
These tasks cannot be accomplished unilaterally – multilateral cooperation is indispensable.
Of course, some progress in treaty-making by smaller groups of states is possible, particularly by those with the largest nuclear arsenals, the Russian Federation and the United States. Early ratification of the US-Russia START treaty would be a step in the right direction.
Yet other advances of the rule of law in nuclear disarmament will require cooperation on a global scale. One of the most important and overdue developments in this area is the entry into force of the CTBT, which will outlaw all nuclear explosions, regardless of their size, location, or declared purpose.
The idea of outlawing such tests was first floated in 1954 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who framed his proposal in the context of broader progress toward nuclear disarmament, just as we are doing today. The CTBT has now been signed by 182 states and will enter into force after being ratified by nine more: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and the US, while Indonesia has announced it will ratify it soon.
This ban on nuclear tests will be backed up with a verification regime that spans the globe.
Even today, thanks to a variety of sophisticated means, we can detect very small nuclear tests in remote locations.
The treaty is also fair—it includes the same rights and responsibilities for all its parties.
It sets a new standard for nuclear weapons treaty obligations and verification.
The CTBT is needed because of the role of nuclear tests in the development and improvement of nuclear weapons.
Such tests are also political symbols that have no place in a world determined to eliminate these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction.
On an issue as important as this, voluntary promises not to test are simply not enough.
Other treaties are needed as well, especially one outlawing the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.
We believe that non-nuclear-weapon states also deserve legally binding assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons.
Moreover, there is merit in seeking additional treaties to outlaw weapons in space, establish agreed norms for missile defense, and make certain that nuclear materials and technologies are kept safe and secure.
Together, these steps will take us far down the road to a nuclear-weapon-free world – not as an act of faith, but as a prudent investment in the peace and security of all peoples.
This would be perhaps the greatest legacy we could leave for future generations.

The IMF’s Missed Opportunity

Unlearned Lessons from the Housing Bubble
NEW HAVEN – There is a lot of misunderstanding about home prices.
Many people all over the world seem to have thought that since we are running out of land in a rapidly growing world economy, the prices of houses and apartments should increase at huge rates.
That misunderstanding encouraged people to buy homes for their investment value – and thus was a major cause of the real estate bubbles around the world whose collapse fueled the current economic crisis.
This misunderstanding may also contribute to an increase in home prices again, after the crisis ends.
Indeed, some people are already starting to salivate at the speculative possibilities of buying homes in currently depressed markets.
But we do not really have a land shortage.
Every major country of the world has abundant land in the form of farms and forests, much of which can be converted someday into urban land.
Less than 1% of the earth’s land area is densely urbanized, and even in the most populated major countries, the share is less than 10%.
There are often regulatory barriers to converting farmland into urban land, but these barriers tend to be thwarted in the long run if economic incentives to work around them become sufficiently powerful.
It becomes increasingly difficult for governments to keep telling their citizens that they can’t have an affordable home because of land restrictions.
The price of farmland hasn’t grown so fast as to make investors rich.
In the United States, the price of agricultural land grew only 0.9% a year in real (inflation-adjusted) terms over the entire twentieth century.
Most of the benefit from land for investors has to be from the profit that agribusiness can make from their operations, not just from the appreciation of the price of land.
Despite a huge twenty-first century boom in cropland prices in the US that parallels the housing boom of the 2000’s, the average price of a hectare of cropland was still only $6,800 in 2008, according to the US Department of Agriculture, and one could build 10-20 single-family houses surrounded by comfortable-sized lots on this land, or one could build an apartment building housing 300 people.
Land costs could easily be as low as $20 per person, or less than $0.50 per year over a lifetime. Of course, such land may not be in desirable locations today, but desirable locations can be created by urban planning.
Many people seem to think that the US experience is not generalizable, because the US has so much land relative to its population.
Population per square kilometer in 2005 was 31 in the US, compared with 53 in Mexico, 138 in China, 246 in the United Kingdom, 337 in Japan, and 344 in India.
But, to the extent that the products of land (food, timber, ethanol) are traded on world markets, the price of any particular kind of land should be roughly the same everywhere.
Farmers will not be able to make a profit operating in some country where land is very expensive, and farmers would give up in those countries unless the price of land fell roughly to world levels, though corrections would have to be made for differing labor costs and other factors.
Shortages of construction materials do not seem to be a reason to expect high home prices, either.
For example, in the US, the Engineering News Record Building Cost Index (which is based on prices of labor, concrete, steel, and lumber) has actually fallen relative to consumer prices over the past 30 years.
To the extent that there is a world market for these factors of production, the situation should not be entirely different in other countries.
An even more troublesome fallacy is that people tend to confuse price levels with rates of price change.
They think that arguments implying that home prices are higher in one country than another are also arguments that the rate of increase in those prices should be higher there.
But, the truth may be just the opposite.
Higher home prices in a given country may tend to create conditions for falling home prices there in the future.
The kinds of expectations for real estate prices that have informed public thinking during the recent bubbles were often totally unrealistic.
A few years ago Karl Case and I asked random home buyers in US cities undergoing bubbles how much they think the price of their home will rise each year on average over the next ten years.
The median answer was sometimes 10% a year.
If one compounds that rate over ten years, they were expecting an increase of a factor of 2.5, and, if one extrapolates, a 2000-fold increase over the course of a lifetime.
Home prices cannot have shown such increases over long time periods, for then no one could afford a home.
The sobering truth is that the current world economic crisis was substantially caused by the collapse of speculative bubbles in real estate (and stock) markets – bubbles that were made possible by widespread misunderstandings of the factors influencing prices.
These misunderstandings have not been corrected, which means that the same kinds of speculative dislocations could recur.

Russia's "Great Game" in Iraq and Iran
As America's debate over toppling Saddam Hussein's regime intensifies, Russia is moving to center stage. This week Russia signed a $40 billion trade and economic cooperation treaty with Iraq while meeting Iranian leaders to discuss nuclear non-proliferation.
Christopher Granville, a former British diplomat and now chief strategist for United Financial Group, a Russian investment bank, analyzes Russia's long-term interests and likely actions.
While no country seems able to trouble the Bush administration's military calculations concerning Iraq, Russia does combine serious interests in the region with marginally significant military capabilities. But Russia's real importance in any looming US-Iraq war lies not so much in its residual military power, as in the light its position sheds not only on the Iraqi problem but on that other member of the "axis of evil": Iran.
So far, the most striking feature of the Putin administration's handling of the US-Iraq situation has been its silence.
If forced to state a view, Russian diplomats stick to a standard line about implementing UN Security Council resolutions and the need for Security Council endorsement of any new actions against Iraq. Unlike other leading West European countries, President Putin and his government prefer to keep their heads down, reflecting their wish to nurture Russia's new and still-fragile rapprochement with the US.
But this explanation does not fit Russian policy on Iran, where, despite US pressure, the Putin government is quite literally sticking to its guns by selling weapons and civil nuclear technology to Teheran. The nuclear issue came to the fore during the recent visit to Moscow by US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.
American arguments against Russian cooperation center on Iran's motives for developing nuclear power.
Given the country's massive hydrocarbon reserves, the Iranian regime has no obvious need for such a program besides its suspected ambition to develop nuclear weapons. Transfer of atomic energy know-how from Russia is seen as a first step towards achieving that goal.
Russian officials reply that there can be no serious objection to such civil nuclear cooperation programs so long as the recipient country accepts the safeguards and inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
This is the case with Iran. Russian officials like to point out that the US and other Western countries once planned similar cooperation program with countries, including North Korea, which do not accept the rigorous IAEA safeguards to which Iran has agreed.
Russia's government argues in a similar vein that its conventional arms sales to Iran concerns supplies of equipment that have no bearing on concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
It challenges the US and others to prove the contrary.
In response, the US has made a partial, but not fully convincing, case--at least publicly.
After talks with Mr Abraham, Russia indicated that implementation of nuclear projects in Iran beyond the existing one at Bushehr would be subject to a review of domestic political developments. But that seems more like a tactical move aimed at appeasing the US, rather than a reflection of genuine second thoughts on nuclear cooperation with Iran in principle.
All of this suggests that the Putin administration has other goals besides proving Russia's new-found friendship with the US.
Deeper interests underlie Russia's attitude toward Iran and its tacit accommodation of US war plans against Iraq.
One need look no further than the country's external financial position.
Russia inherited all of the Soviet Union's foreign financial claims and liabilities.
It now spends up to $10 billion a year servicing Soviet-era debts.
Soviet-era claims, on the other hand, are almost all beyond recovery.
Oil-rich Iraq's debts, with a face value amounting to many billions of dollars (deriving mainly from export credits for arms sales), are a rare exception.
Russia's main interest in Iraq is to get these loans repaid, and then resume arms sales, while simultaneously becoming a major, perhaps the dominant, foreign player in Iraq's oil and gas sector.
Ever since the Gulf War, Russia has pursued these goals by promoting rehabilitation of Saddam's Iraq via the implementation of Security Council resolutions and the lifting of sanctions.
That route now looks hopeless.
So the US goal of regime change in Baghdad does not look too bad, even if it cannot be publicly supported.
For President Putin it makes sense to stay on the sidelines over Iraq, at least for now, and to be repaid later for his helpful silence in the form of US influence on the successor Iraqi regime concerning repayment of the country's Russian debts.
If the US war in Iraq fails, the situation will hardly be worse than it is now from the narrow point of view of Russian interests, while the resulting mess will be a problem for the US and its traditional allies rather than for Russia.
The contrast between Russia's handling of Iraq and Iran underlines not only Mr Putin's famous pragmatism, but the sophistication and adroitness of his policy.
This contrast also reflects the fundamental difference between Iran, an historical nation state, and the artificial creation that is Iraq.
Russia's long-term interests in Iran require permanent engagement.
Iran's Islamic revolution will inevitably run its course and mutate into a new form of nationalism, to some extent mirroring Russia's own transition out of the Soviet system.
With Iraq, the opposite is true, because not only the regime but the country itself might cease to exist, or at least be radically transformed, should Hussein fall. Putin's goal is to put Russia in a position to exploit such transformations.

Managing the Politics of Water
AMMAN – This year’s World Water Day, on March 22, provides an opportunity to highlight what in many countries has become a grim reality: The availability of fresh water is increasingly a defining strategic factor in regional and global affairs.
Unless water resources are managed with extraordinary care, the consequences could be devastating.
Last year, the United Nations World Water Development Report once again highlighted how the growing gap between supply and demand could create conflict.
The World Economic Forum has ranked water crises as the most worrying global threat, more dangerous than terrorist attacks or financial meltdowns, and more likely to occur than the use of weapons of mass destruction.
And research by the Strategic Foresight Group has shown the importance of wise management: Countries engaged in the joint stewardship of water resources are exceedingly unlikely to go to war.
The Middle East serves as a tragic example of what can happen when regional cooperation is lacking.
Iraq, Syria, and Turkey have fought over every cubic meter of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
All have lost as a result.
Non-state actors control important parts of the two river basins.
And water shortages have aggravated the region’s refugee crisis (itself the apotheosis of poor governance).
The bitterest part of the tragedy is that it could have been avoided.
In 2010, at the West Asia-North Africa Forum in Amman, we proposed the creation of “circles of cooperation,” which would have institutionalized collaboration among Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey on water and environmental issues.
A similar arrangement would have helped manage environmental resources shared by Jordan, Israel, and Palestine.
If a supranational organization had been created, it could have introduced joint strategies to manage drought, coordinate crop patterns, develop common standards to monitor river flows, and implement investment plans to create livelihoods and develop water-treatment technologies.
Other regions have done exactly that.
Countries sharing rivers in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America have recognized that national interests and regional stability can be mutually reinforcing if human needs are given priority over chauvinism.
Last fall, the international community adopted the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which promise to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.”
Part of this pledge is a commitment to “expand international cooperation.”
Those in charge of implementing this commitment must bear in mind that water cooperation is not merely about signing treaties and holding meetings.
It also entails jointly planning infrastructure projects, managing floods and droughts, developing an integrated strategy to combat climate change, ensuring the quality of water courses, and holding regular summits to negotiate tradeoffs between water and other public goods.
The Water Cooperation Quotient, a measure of collaboration created by the Strategic Foresight Group, can help countries sharing river basins and lakes monitor the intensity of their cooperation.
Out of 263 shared river basins, only a quarter benefit from properly functioning collaborative organizations. It is crucial that such organizations be extended to cover every shared river basin in the world by the SDGs’ target year, 2030.
For poor people in the developing world, such transboundary cooperation generates significant dividends.
When countries agree on the construction and management of critical infrastructure, there are no delays.
Costs are saved.
Benefits are shared in an optimum way.
If all developing countries with shared river basins embraced transboundary cooperation, their GDP growth easily could rise by a percentage point.
The international community should encourage countries to embrace such cooperation by creating financial instruments that make concessional and preferential funds available.
A global Marshall Plan for shared river basins might at first seem like an expensive proposition; but the cost of inaction – consider the threat to Europe alone posed by massive refugee inflows – easily could be several orders of magnitude higher.
Likewise, the international community should act promptly to save critical water infrastructure from acts of violence and terrorism.
Many rivers, including the Tigris and the Euphrates, have been and continue to be cradles of human civilization.
The UN should consider creating special peacekeeping forces to protect them.
Finally, international law should be designed to prevent, not just resolve, conflicts.
In particular, a robust global treaty is needed to regulate emissions into bodies of water.
Today, most disagreements over water concern the quantity parties are to receive.
In the future, conflicts will increasingly be about water quality, as irrigation practices, industrialization, and urbanization contribute to rising pollution levels.
World Water Day is the ideal occasion to launch a new agenda for water wisdom.
But every day must be a day when we work together to manage one of the planet’s most important resources.

The Benefits of Chinese FDI
BERKELEY – In a rare act of bipartisanship, the United States Congress recently passed legislation to encourage more inward foreign direct investment.
Democrats and Republicans agree that FDI, or “insourcing,” is important to US jobs and competitiveness.
They are right.
But, even as they propose new measures to court foreign investors, many members of Congress in both parties harbor deep concerns about FDI from China, on both national-security and economic grounds.
These concerns are unwarranted, and discriminatory policies to restrict such investment are ill-advised.
The US government already has adequate controls in place to review and block FDI from all countries, including China, that pose anti-competitive and national-security risks.
Investments that clear these controls benefit the US economy in numerous ways and should be welcomed.
Foreign-owned firms in the US account for 5% of private-sector employment, 17% of manufacturing jobs, 21% of exports, 14% of research and development, and 17% of corporate-income taxes.
Recognizing FDI’s significant contributions to the US economy, President Barack Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness endorsed the administration’s new Select USA program to coordinate government-wide efforts to promote it.
To be sure, the US remains the world’s leading destination for FDI, accounting for 15% of global flows.
But its share is declining, while China, using both carrots (like tax holidays and special enterprise zones) and sticks (like explicit and implicit local-content requirements) to attract foreign companies, has become the second-largest destination.
China has remained a small source of FDI outflows, but that, too, is changing rapidly.
Chinese outward FDI soared from an average of $3 billion per year before 2005 to $60 billion in 2010, catapulting China into the top five sources of FDI on a three-year moving-average basis.
Given the size of China’s economy, its growth rate, and the experience of other developing economies, FDI from China is likely to increase by $1-2 trillion by 2020.
An increase in FDI outflows is a priority in China for two reasons.
First, China has an understandable interest in diversifying its substantial holdings of foreign-exchange reserves away from low-yielding US Treasuries to real productive assets with higher returns. That is why China established its sovereign-wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, and why CIC decision-makers are seeking more FDI opportunities.
Second, China’s businesses have been encouraged to “go global” and invest abroad to find new markets, secure access to energy and raw materials, and enhance their competitiveness by acquiring new technologies, brands, and management skills. In a recent report, the People’s Bank of China urged Chinese companies to acquire foreign firms as the first stage of a ten-year plan to ease China’s capital-market restrictions – long a goal of US policymakers.
So far, China’s FDI outflows have been concentrated in developing countries and a handful of resource-rich developed countries, including Australia and Canada, and have been aimed at facilitating trade and acquiring access to natural resources.
But the patterns and destinations of China’s outward FDI will change as rising wages, an appreciating real exchange rate, and the entry of new suppliers from other emerging countries erode Chinese companies’ competitiveness, motivating them to invest abroad to upgrade their technology and management capabilities, find new growth opportunities, and move up the value chain.
Currently, the US receives only about 2-3% of FDI flows from China.
But China’s direct investments in the US have increased rapidly, from less than $1 billion annually in 2003-2008 to more than $5 billion per year in 2010-2011. At least 38 US states now host FDI projects from China, and competition for Chinese investment has intensified as states’ budgets have contracted.
Of course, alongside the potential economic benefits of attracting a much larger share of Chinese FDI, legitimate competitive and national-security concerns do need to be addressed. First, like all mergers and acquisitions involving both domestic and foreign investors, investments in or acquisitions of US companies by Chinese companies, whether state-owned or private, must be evaluated by the US Justice Department for their impact on market competition.
Investments with significant anti-competitive effects must be modified or blocked.
Second, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) must screen investments in or acquisitions of US companies by foreign companies, including Chinese companies, for national-security risks.
Such screening is a common and justifiable practice around the world.
In recent years, CFIUS has defined national security broadly to encompass not only defense activities and dual-use technologies, but also critical infrastructure, including telecommunications, energy, and transport – areas of particular interest to Chinese companies.
Many Chinese investors view the CFIUS screening process as protectionist and targeted at them, but there is no evidence of this.
The United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Israel accounted for more than half of all CFIUS cases reviewed in 2008-2010, while China accounted for only about 5%.
Only a small fraction of Chinese FDI in the US is subject to CFIUS review, and most of these projects, like most reviewed by CFIUS, are approved, sometimes with mitigation measures.
CFIUS does not review greenfield investments, which account for about 50% of Chinese FDI in the US.
But Chinese FDI, especially in sensitive sectors like energy, does often trigger Congressional hearings, ad hoc resolutions, and calls for tougher CFIUS action. As a result of high-profile Congressional opposition, China’s state-owned energy company CNOOC withdrew its bid for Unocal, an American energy company, in 2005, before a CFIUS review that most likely would have cleared the deal on national-security grounds.
China still points to this episode as evidence that Chinese FDI is not welcome in the US.
Feeding this perception, some members of Congress are now exhorting CFIUS to block CNOOC’s proposed acquisition of Nexen, a Canadian energy company with holdings in the Gulf of Mexico, until China resolves ongoing disputes with the US over preferential government procurement policies and barriers to FDI by US companies in China. Heeding these calls would be a costly mistake that would undermine the objective, non-discriminatory CFIUS process and encourage Chinese companies to look elsewhere at a time when Chinese FDI is poised to explode and the US economy sorely needs the jobs, capital, and trade benefits that it would bring.

The Fall of the Berlin Wall and Social Democracy
CAMBRIDGE – It was already clear 30 years ago that the fall of the Berlin Wall would change everything.
But precisely what that change will mean for world politics in the twenty-first century still remains to be seen.
By 1989, the Soviet Union, and communism generally, had condemned tens of millions of people to poverty, and had clearly failed to compete with the Western economic model.
Over four decades, the Cold War had taken millions of lives in various theaters around the world (where the conflict was much hotter than its name suggests), and created a pretext for repression and elite dominance in dozens of countries across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
Yet for all its positive implications, the post-Cold War era also upended the Western social-democratic compact: the system of safety nets, regulations, universal public services, redistributive tax policies, and labor-market institutions that had long protected workers and the less fortunate.
According to the political scientist Ralf Dahrendorf (as quoted by the late Tony Judt), that policy consensus had signified “the greatest progress which history has seen so far.” Not only had it limited and then reduced inequality in most advanced economies; it also contributed to decades of sustained growth.
The economic growth of the post-war era was born of broadly competitive markets, which had been created through regulations to break the backs of monopolies and powerful conglomerates.
It also depended on a generously supported system of public education and government-funded innovation.
The proliferation of high-paying good jobs during this period was the result of labor-market institutions that prevented employers from wielding excessive powers over their employees; without such constraints, firms would have generated low-wage jobs with harsh working conditions.
Social democracy played an equally important role in politics.
Its redistributive institutions and welfare-state programs could not have survived without non-elites wielding political power.
Broad-based political participation was achieved through reforms to expand the franchise and deepen democratic processes.
It was supported by powerful political parties, such as the Swedish Workers’ Party, and trade unions.
And it was driven by universalist ideas that motivated people to support and defend democracy.
In many ways, the United States was no different from its Western European counterparts.
Throughout the New Deal and post-war eras, it enthusiastically busted trusts and reined in the political influence of the wealthy.
It instituted government-administered old-age and disability pensions (Social Security), unemployment benefits, and redistributive taxation, and adopted various anti-poverty measures.
While deploying anti-socialist language, it nonetheless adopted social democracy with American characteristics – which meant, among other things, that its social safety net was weaker than in other countries.
None of this can be understood in the absence of communism.
After all, social-democratic movements emerged from communist parties, many of which – including the Social Democrats in post-war Germany and the French Socialist Party – did not abandon socialist rhetoric until well into the 1960s, or even the 1980s. While the parties that proved most successful in creating new labor-market institutions, securing high-quality public services, and reaching a broad social consensus, such as the Swedish Workers’ Party or the British Labour Party, had typically repudiated their earlier Marxism, they still spoke the same language as their Marxist cousins.
More to the point, elites themselves embraced the social-democratic compact as a means of preventing communist revolution.
It was this anti-communist mode of social democracy that motivated intellectuals such as the economist John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the post-war order, and political leaders from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in the US. Similarly, the threat of communism (from North Korea) drove South Korean leaders to pursue ambitious land reforms and investments in education, while tolerating some degree of union activity despite their desire to keep wages low.
But when communism collapsed – both as an economic system and as an ideology – it knocked the legs out from under the social-democratic stool.
Suddenly faced with the need to invent a new, equally inclusive, equally universalist ideology, the left proved unequal to the task.
And at the same time, the leaders of an already ascendant right interpreted the collapse of communism as a signal (and an opportunity) to roll back social democracy in favor of the market.
Yet, for a number of reasons, the embrace of this agenda in much of the West was mistaken.
For starters, it ignored the contribution that the welfare state, labor-market institutions, and government investments in research and development had made to post-war growth.
Second, it failed to anticipate that dismantling social-democratic institutions would weaken democracy itself, by further empowering incumbent politicians and the wealthy (who would become much wealthier in the process).
And, third, it ignored the lessons of the interwar years, when the absence of broad-based economic opportunities and strong safety nets had created the conditions for the rise of left- and right-wing extremism.
US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may have envisioned a world with more efficient markets and less bureaucratic controls.
But the political revolution they launched has culminated in the presidency of Donald Trump in the US and a Boris Johnson-led government in the United Kingdom.
The social-democratic compact now needs to be refashioned for the twenty-first century.
To that end, we need to recognize the problems facing advanced economies, from uncontrolled deregulation and finance run amok to the structural changes brought about by globalization and automation.
We also need to form a new political coalition that is broad enough to include industrial workers, who remain among the most politically active segments of the population, even as their numbers have fallen.
But, most important, we must recognize that curtailing the power of big companies; providing universal public services, including health care and high-quality education; protecting workers and preventing the rise of low-wage, precarious employment; and investing in R&D are not just policies that should be evaluated in terms of their economic consequences.
They are the essence of the social-democratic project, and the foundation of a prosperous and stable society.

Europe and the Euro
PARIS – For anyone living in the 16 eurozone member states, the euro’s enduring success is both a technical and an emotional issue; both hearts and minds are involved.
I consider it axiomatic that the euro is vital to Europe and, indeed, to the world economy.
First of all, it should be recalled that the European idea began as a project for ensuring peace and democracy among Europe’s peoples.
When the new currency was introduced in 1999 – and even more so when European citizens had their first opportunity to use it in January 2002 – it was experienced as the most tangible, decisive proof that European integration was a reality.
As the slogan goes: euro in your wallet, Europe in your pocket.
Twenty years after the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage in 1979, the introduction of the euro marked a logical extension of the European dream.
It should also be recalled, however, that when Slovenia entered the eurozone in 2007, many people suggested that the country was somehow joining “Old Europe.”
But Cyprus, Malta, and Slovakia have since followed suit in making the euro their currency.
From Dublin on the shore of the Irish Sea to Bratislava in the foothills of the Carpathians, the same coins and banknotes are legal tender, and they are constantly pushing back the European Union’s boundaries.
Tomorrow will bring additional members, such as Estonia, which is slated to join the eurozone on January 1, 2011.
Europe’s “Founding Fathers” were right that “Europe will not be made all at once,” and neither will the euro.
Our common currency should rather be viewed as an inspiring symbol – the symbol of a Europe that is vibrant, attractive, and, above all, cohesive.
Just how cohesive Europe can be is something that we know from the experience of the past few months.
The history of the euro, not surprisingly, has turned out to represent a further stage in the ongoing saga of a European economy that has been in a state of perpetual construction since the Treaty of Rome.
The financial support provided to Greece; the new European Financial Stability Facility, which we created to extend guarantees to eurozone member states in need; and our efforts to achieve more effective financial regulation are among the latest illustrations of European cohesion in practice.
Admittedly, the various crises affecting the eurozone have highlighted – sometimes starkly so – the need to reform our institutions and the way they operate.
It has been argued that Europe’s institutions move forward only in times of crisis.
Perhaps the same is true of the single currency, which will derive strength and validation from the challenges that it overcomes.
In the last few months, as it just barely emerged from the deepest economic and financial crisis in close to a century, the eurozone experienced the worst jolts in its history, although in terms of public finance, the eurozone as a whole has fared better than the United States or Japan.
Once the extent of Greece’s financial crisis and the difficulties encountered by other member states became known, the eurozone economies found themselves on the brink of disaster.
But the EU reacted swiftly and forcefully, with a support program for Greece and a financial guarantee plan for the entire eurozone.
In this state of emergency, a genuine European economic government, most compellingly advocated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, began to take shape.
Following the European Council meeting in June, France and Germany jointly outlined a number of possible reforms.
Three key points emerged, concerning the need to:
· strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, notably through enhanced European coordination during a “European Semester”;
· maintain our efforts to expand the scope of economic surveillance to include government deficits and public as well as private-sector debt, if necessary by imposing “political penalties”;
· establish a credible crisis-resolution framework without encroaching on the budgetary prerogatives of member states.
Other possible approaches are under consideration as well.
But what they all share is the recognition that the time has clearly come to stabilize and institutionalize a European economic government.
That process is already well under way.
The European Commission has made proposals, and the working group chaired by European President Herman Van Rompuy, in which I represent France, will be submitting its own in the fall.
We all expect that the euro, which proved to be such an asset during the crisis, will be just as effective in getting our economies back on the path to vigorous, sustainable growth.
Indeed, according to Eurostat (the EU’s statistical office), by the second quarter of 2010, the eurozone was growing faster than the US, while the euro remains the second most widely used trading currency.
The euro, like the EU itself, is an exciting adventure that must continue – and we intend to make sure that it does.

Remove and Ban Trump Now
BERLIN – A year ago, jurists and pundits were debating whether impeaching an American president is primarily a matter of law or of politics.
It is both, of course, and there is nothing wrong with the political part.
Under the US Constitution, it is politicians, not courts, who are supposed to judge whether a president has committed “high crimes and misdemeanors,” and, crucially, whether a chief executive poses an ongoing threat to the republic.
With less than two weeks to go before Joe Biden replaces Donald Trump in the White House, the issue has come up again, with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi making clear that the president should be removed either by his cabinet, through the 25th Amendment, or by impeachment.
The violent insurrection at the US Capitol, incited by Trump, represents something new and profane in American history.
Even though Biden will be inaugurated on January 20, the office of the presidency cannot be made safe in Trump’s hands.
He must be impeached (again), removed from office, and barred from holding public office ever again.
Congress has a right, but not a duty, to impeach.
Sometimes, lawmakers might simply tolerate certain presidential misdeeds, having concluded that the costs of pursuing further action would outweigh the benefits.
But this is not one of those times.
Just as the act of punishing a public official sends a message about a polity’s moral commitments, so, too, does a failure to punish when it is warranted.
By voting to acquit Trump last year, after the House of Representatives impeached him over the Ukraine scandal, Senate Republicans signaled that they were sticking with a career criminal, come what may.
Trump enablers like Senator Susan Collins of Maine hoped that those proceedings would teach Trump a lesson. And so they did: Trump learned that there were no consequences for illegally coercing others into doing him favors and rigging elections on his behalf.
Recall Trump’s “perfect” phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer of 2019, when he threatened to withhold US military aid unless Ukraine announced an investigation into Biden’s son, Hunter.
After getting off scot-free for that abuse of his office, Trump went on to have another perfect chat in the winter of 2020, when he tried to blackmail Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, into falsifying the result of last November’s election on his behalf.
All those Republicans who have condemned the second call should be asking themselves why they condoned the first one.
If there is no punishment for the insurrection at the Capitol, congressional Republicans will again be signaling their own complicity in the crime.
The message will be that this, too, is acceptable: a sitting president may indeed incite violence against one of the republic’s three political branches.
Some will worry that a second impeachment and a permanent ban would merely provoke Trump’s “base.”
But this argument no longer holds water.
No matter what Democrats or half-way responsible Republicans like Senator Mitt Romney do or don’t do, Trump and his cheerleaders in the right-wing media will incite the movement anyway.
After all, right-wing populism is not subject to a reality check; an actual vote count is practically irrelevant for people who see themselves as the only “real Americans” (and therefore the only ones that count).
Mobilizing these supposedly “real Americans” against nefarious elites and minorities (who should all go back to their “shit-hole countries”) has been Trump’s political model from day one, just as his business model as a real-estate developer was based on flimflam and fraud. Many a MAGA grifter and opportunistic Republican has invested in that political enterprise, and it will take more than a little bit of sedition and a few dead bodies in Washington, DC, for them to start dumping their shares.
The crucial step is not just to remove Trump but to ban him from politics for life. Though this entails a permanent restriction of an individual’s basic political rights, many democracies nonetheless allow for such a possibility.
For example, according to the German Basic Law, those who abuse free speech and other fundamental liberties in order to undermine liberal democracy can lose their rights.
This provision has never been successfully applied, though, partly because the neo-Nazis for whom a permanent loss was considered had already been taken out of political circulation by criminal convictions.
To be sure, a permanent ban sits uneasily with a core assumption of democracy: people can change their minds.
Contrary to Hillary Clinton’s assertion in her infamous 2016 speech describing Trump’s base as a “basket of deplorables,” no one is utterly “irredeemable.”
If you are one of the many people who favors restoring voting rights to convicted felons, how could you justify a ban against someone like Trump?
What if Trump were to repent and reinvent himself?
Should we not be consistent in refusing to ban anyone permanently?
Never mind that repentance is unlikely.
Trump has persistently tried to subvert the democratic process itself.
That is not just any high crime or misdemeanor; nor is it comparable to any business dealings before (and during) the presidency for which he could be prosecuted.
If someone refuses to play by the rules of the game (especially rules as basic as “the candidate who gets the most votes wins”), it is perfectly reasonable to eject that player.
Would Republicans support such a move?
Plenty, like Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, have bet their political fortunes on genuflecting to America’s burgeoning far-right movement.
But others might now be looking for a way out of the Trumpian maw.
The storming of the Capitol demonstrated that you cannot have QAnon à la carte; neither Trump nor his Republican collaborators can control the forces they have unleashed.
The revolution always devours its own children, and sometimes their fathers, too.
If Republicans fail to de-Trumpify fully and immediately, they will learn that for themselves – but not before things get much, much worse.

The Rocky Road to Recovery
NEW YORK – A consensus now exists that America’s recession – already a year old – is likely to be long and deep, and that almost all countries will be affected.
I always thought that the notion that what happened in America would be decoupled from the rest of the world was a myth.
Events are showing that to be so.
Fortunately, America has, at last, a president with some understanding of the nature and severity of the problem, and who has committed himself to a strong stimulus program.
This, together with concerted action by governments elsewhere, will mean that the downturn will be less severe than it otherwise would be.
The United States Federal Reserve, which helped create the problems through a combination of excessive liquidity and lax regulation, is trying to make amends – by flooding the economy with liquidity, a move that, at best, has merely prevented matters from being worse.
It’s not surprising that those who helped create the problems and didn’t see the disaster coming have not done a masterly job in dealing with it.
By now, the dynamics of the downturn are set, and things will get worse before they get better.
In some ways, the Fed resembles a drunk driver who, suddenly realizing that he is heading off the road starts careening from side to side.
The response to the lack of liquidity is ever more liquidity.
When the economy starts recovering, and banks start lending, will they be able to drain the liquidity smoothly out of the system?
Will America face a bout of inflation?
Or, more likely, in another moment of excess, will the Fed over-react, nipping the recovery in the bud?
Given the unsteady hand exhibited so far, we cannot have much confidence in what awaits us.
Still, I am not sure that there is sufficient appreciation of some of the underlying problems facing the global economy, without which the current global recession is unlikely to give way to robust growth – no matter how good a job the Fed does.
For a long time, the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going.
America’s profligacy – the fact that the world’s richest country could not live within its means – was often criticized.
But perhaps the world should be thankful, because without American profligacy, there would have been insufficient global aggregate demand.
In the past, developing countries filled this role, running trade and fiscal deficits.
But they paid a high price, and fiscal responsibility and conservative monetary policies are now the fashion.
Indeed, many developing countries, fearful of losing their economic sovereignty to the IMF – as occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis – accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves.
Money put into reserves is income not spent.
Moreover, growing inequality in most countries of the world has meant that money has gone from those who would spend it to those who are so well off that, try as they might, they can’t spend it all.
The world’s unending appetite for oil, beyond its ability or willingness to produce, has contributed a third factor.
Rising oil prices transferred money to oil-rich countries, again contributing to the flood of liquidity.
Though oil prices have been dampened for now, a robust recovery could send them soaring again.
For a while, people spoke almost approvingly of the flood of liquidity.
But this was just the flip side of what Keynes had worried about – insufficient global aggregate demand.
The search for return contributed to the reckless leverage and risk taking that underlay this crisis.
America’s government will, for a time, partly make up for the increasing savings of US consumers.
But if America’s consumers go from their near zero savings to a modest 4% or 5% of GDP, then the depressing effect on demand (in addition to that resulting from declines in investment, exports, and state and local government expenditures) will not be fully offset by even the largest government expenditure programs. In two years, governments, mindful of the huge increases in the debt burden resulting from the mega-bailouts and the mind-boggling deficits, will be under pressure to run primary surpluses (where government spending net of interest payments is less than revenues.)
A few years ago, there was worry about the risk of a disorderly unwinding of “global imbalances.”
The current crisis can be viewed as part of that, but little is being done about the underlying problems that gave rise to these imbalances.
We need not just temporary stimuli, but longer-term solutions.
It is not as if there was a shortage of needs; it is only that those who might meet those needs have a shortage of funds.
First, we need to reverse the worrying trends of growing inequality.
More progressive income taxation will also help stabilize the economy, through what economists call “automatic stabilizers.”
It would also help if the advanced developed countries fulfilled their commitments to helping the world’s poorest by increasing their foreign-aid budgets to 0.7% of GDP.
Second, the world needs enormous investments if it is to respond to the challenges of global warming.
Transportation systems and living patterns must be changed dramatically.
Third, a global reserve system is needed.
It makes little sense for the world’s poorest countries to lend money to the richest at low interest rates.
The system is unstable.
The dollar reserve system is fraying, but is likely to be replaced with a dollar/euro or dollar/euro/yen system that is even more unstable.
Annual emissions of a global reserve currency (what Keynes called Bancor, or the IMF calls SDRs) could help fuel global aggregate demand, and be used to promote development and address the problems of global warming.
This year will be bleak.
The question we need to be asking now is, how can we enhance the likelihood that we will eventually emerge into a robust recovery?

America Is the New Center of Global Instability
NEW YORK – Whether the storming of the US Capitol was an attempted coup, an insurrection, or an assault on democracy is merely a question of semantics.
What matters is that the violence was aimed at derailing a legitimate transition of power for the benefit and at the behest of a dangerous madman.
President Donald Trump, who has never hidden his dictatorial aspirations, should now be removed from power, barred from public office, and prosecuted for high crimes.
After all, the events of January 6 may have been shocking, but they were not surprising.
I and many other commentators had long warned that the 2020 election would bring civil unrest, violence, and attempts by Trump to remain in power illegally.
Beyond his election-related crimes, Trump is also guilty of a reckless disregard for public health.
He and his administration bear much of the blame for the massive COVID-19 death toll in the United States, which accounts for only 4% of the global population but 20% of all coronavirus deaths.
Once a beacon of democracy, rule of law, and good governance, the US now looks like a banana republic that is incapable of controlling either a contagious disease – despite spending more on health care per capita than any other country – or mobs incited by a wannabe dictator.
Authoritarian leaders around the world are now laughing at the US and scoffing at American critiques of others’ political misrule. As if the damage done to US soft power over the past four years was not immense enough, Trump’s failed insurrection has undermined America’s standing even more.
Worse, although President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated in about a week, that is plenty of time for Trump to create more mayhem.
Right-wing militias and white supremacists are already planning more acts of protest, violence, and racial warfare in cities across the US.
And strategic rivals such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea will be looking to exploit the chaos by sowing disinformation or launching cyber-attacks, including potentially against critical US infrastructure.
At the same time, a desperate Trump may try to “wag the dog” by ordering a strike – perhaps with a tactical nuclear warhead – on Iran’s main nuclear facility in Natanz, on the grounds that it is being used to enrich uranium.
Far from this being out of the question, the Trump administration has already held drills with stealth bombers and fighter jets – loaded, for the first time, with tactical nuclear weapons – to signal to Iran that its air defenses are no defense at all.
No wonder Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi felt the need to reach out to the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss steps to prevent a nuclear strike by the Dr. Strangelove in the White House. Whereas an unwarranted order to launch a nuclear attack on a target with a large civilian population would be rejected by the military as obviously “illegal,” an attack on a military target in a non-populated area might not be, even if it would have dire geopolitical consequences.
Moreover, Trump knows that both Saudi Arabia and Israel would tacitly support an attack on Iran (indeed, the US may avail itself of Saudi logistical and ground support to carry one out, given the shorter range of nuclear-armed fighter jets).
The prospect of an attack on Iran may give Vice President Mike Pence the pretext he needs to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from power.
But even if this were to happen, it would not necessarily be a win for democracy and the rule of law.
Trump could – and likely would – be pardoned by Pence (as Richard Nixon was by Gerald Ford), allowing him to run for president again in 2024 or be a kingmaker in that election, given that he now controls the Republican party and its base.
Removing Trump with the promise of a pardon may be a Faustian deal that Pence strikes with Trump.
Because the self-pardon that Trump has been considering might not pass constitutional muster, it is reasonable to assume that he will be groping around for other creative outs.
He cannot simply resign and allow Pence to issue a pardon, because that would make him look like a “loser” who accepted defeat (the worst insult in Trump’s egomaniacal lexicon).
But if the president were to order an attack on Iran and then become a (pardoned) martyr, he could both preserve his base and avoid accountability.
By the same token, Trump cannot risk being impeached (again), because that would open up the possibility of his being disqualified from holding office in the future.
By this reasoning, he has every incentive to go out with a bang and on his own terms.
If this all sounds like the final days of Nero “fiddling while Rome burned,” that’s because it is.
The decay of the American empire appears to be hastening rapidly.
Given how politically, socially, and economically divided the US is, four years of sound leadership under Biden will not be enough to reverse the damage that has been done.
Most likely, the Republicans will do everything they can to sabotage the new administration, as they did with former President Barack Obama.
Even before the election, US national-security agencies were warning that domestic right-wing terrorism and violence would remain the primary home-grown threat to the US.
With Biden in office, this risk will be higher still.
For the last four years, heavily armed white-supremacist militias have been kept relatively at bay by dint of the fact that they had an ally in the White House.
But once Trump is gone, the groups whom he has instructed to “stand back and stand by” will not simply accept Democratic control of the presidency and Congress.
Trump, operating from Mar-a-Lago, will continue to incite the mob with more lies, conspiracy theories, and falsehoods about a stolen election.
The US will thus most likely be the world’s new epicenter of political and geopolitical instability in the months and years ahead.
America’s allies will need to hedge their bets against a future return of Trumpism, and strategic rivals will continue to try to destabilize the US through asymmetric warfare.
The world is in for a long, ugly, bumpy ride.

Germany’s Bland Grand Coalition
MUNICH – Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), the Christian Democratic Union, and the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have agreed to pursue another “grand coalition” government, and have published a 28-page agreement outlining their proposed policy agenda.
The agreement comes months after an election in which the SPD and CDU/CSU advanced rather different economic-policy views. Whereas the SPD has focused on the need for more redistribution and public spending, the CDU/CSU has promised “tax cuts for all” and a more restrictive refugee policy.
The question now is whether a coalition comprising such ideologically divergent forces can truly prepare Germany for the challenges that await it.
In the months and years ahead, German policymakers will need to manage the transition into the digital era, in order to preserve the country’s competitiveness.
They must also stabilize the welfare state at a time of rapid population aging.
And they must develop a rational migration policy.
On top of this full domestic agenda, many are looking to Germany to keep the European Union together.
As many commentators have pointed out, Germany’s new government will benefit from a budget surplus, because the booming economy, coupled with peculiarities of the German tax code, has boosted government revenues over the last four years.
Even by pursuing the balanced-budget policy described in its provisional coalition agreement, the government will have room either for more spending or tax cuts amounting to €46 billion ($56 billion) – around 0.3% of GDP – over four years.
According to the coalition agreement, €36 billion of the surplus will be allocated to various outlays such as transfers to families, higher agricultural and regional subsidies, housing-construction incentives, roads and related infrastructure, universities and school buildings, and even the military.
That leaves just €10 billion for tax cuts, which will take the form of reductions in the solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag), a special income tax that was introduced in 1991 to finance German reunification.
The grand coalition envisions abolishing this tax for everyone except the top 10% of earners, who generate more than half of the revenue from it.
But when one considers the effects of “bracket creep,” the outlook for taxpayers worsens.
Unlike most other developed countries, Germany’s tax system lacks an automatic adjustment mechanism to prevent inflation from pushing households into higher tax brackets. And while discretionary adjustments do take place, they hardly provide full compensation to countless households that end up paying more tax than they should.
In fact, at the current rate of bracket creep, Germany’s tax revenues will increase by roughly €50 billion over the next four years.
Halving the solidarity surcharge no earlier than 2021 will come nowhere close to offsetting that.
All told, nobody is particularly enthusiastic about the coalition agreement, including the SPD.
Despite the coalition agreement’s emphasis on spending, the SPD fears that participating in another grand coalition will further damage its public standing, and drive more of its voters into the arms of the radical left or the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
For others, the problem is not politics, but the agenda itself: for all of its specific provisions, it achieves very little.
When spread over four years, an additional €2 billion spent on defense, €600 million on universities, and €4 billion on housing will make little difference.
And while the coalition’s plan also promises higher contributions to the EU budget and more spending on the mothers’ pension and low-income households, it does not specify how those increases will be reconciled with a balanced budget.
More fundamentally, the agenda lacks ambition and direction.
It neither provides significant relief to the middle class through tax cuts, nor allocates adequate investment for research, infrastructure, or education.
And it makes no mention of corporate taxation, even though rate cuts in the United States, and planned cuts in France and the United Kingdom, will inevitably lure investment and jobs away from Germany.
A truly bold policy agenda would require the new government to focus on specific priorities and accept that not everyone can get what they want.
Rather than tweaking the margins in a futile attempt to please everyone, the government would set its sights on deeper structural reforms, to lay the foundation for future growth and stability.
For example, Germany spends billions of euros every year on green-energy subsidies.
But as the provisional coalition agreement acknowledges, Germany will likely fall short of its target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, suggesting that these subsidies have not worked.
Fundamental reforms in this area could make Germany’s climate policies both cheaper and more effective.
But doing that would require the government to abandon its ideological position and challenge powerful interest groups.
Nevertheless, the coalition agreement does include some promising ideas.
For example, it proposes a program to attract skilled workers, and to align Germany’s immigration policies with its economic interests.
And although the new government should attach conditions to Germany’s larger EU budget contribution, in order to prevent wasteful spending, its clear commitment to the EU should be welcomed.
There is still time for the coalition partners to revise their program.
Surely, they should want to do more than use the current economic upswing to provide piddling handouts to various constituencies (except those paying the most in taxes, of course).
Now is the time to start preparing Germany for its future challenges.

The Dollar’s Long Tail
NEW DELHI – The ongoing economic crisis and the persistent deficits of the United States have increasingly called into question the dollar’s role as the world’s anchor currency.
Recent moves to internationalize China’s renminbi have led to anticipation of a looming shift in the global monetary system.
Many prominent economists, including the members of a United Nations panel headed by the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, are recommending a “Global Reserve System” to replace the dollar’s hegemony.
But the long history of global anchor currencies suggests that the dollar’s days on top may be far from over.
In ancient times, India ran a large trade surplus with the Roman empire.
As Pliny wrote in the first century: “Not a year passed in which India did not take 50 million sesterces away from Rome.” That trade imbalance implied a continuous drain on gold and silver coin, causing shortages of these metals in Rome.
In modern terms, the Romans faced a monetary squeeze.
Rome responded by reducing the gold/silver content (the ancient equivalent of monetization), which led to sustained inflation in the empire.
But the frequent discovery of Roman coins in India suggests that Roman coinage continued to be accepted internationally long after it must have been obvious that its gold or silver content had fallen.
In the sixteenth century, Spain emerged as a superpower following its conquest of South America.
Between 1501 and 1600, 17 million kilograms of pure silver and 181,000 kilograms of pure gold flowed from the Americas to Spain, which spent the money on wars in the Netherlands and elsewhere.
This increase in liquidity caused both an economic boom and inflation across Europe.
Despite this wealth, Spain became increasingly indebted, eventually defaulting three times – in 1607, 1627, and 1649 – and heading into sharp geopolitical decline.
Yet Spanish silver coins (known as “pieces of eight” or Spanish dollars) remained the main currency used in world trade right up to the American Revolutionary War. In fact, Spanish coin remained legal tender in the US until 1857 – long after Spain itself had ceased to be a major power.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, the world was functioning on a bi-metal system based on gold and silver.
But, following the British example, most major countries had shifted to a gold standard by the 1870’s.
The Bank of England stood ready to convert a pound sterling into an ounce of (11/12 fine) gold on demand.
That system was disrupted by World War I, but Britain went back to a gold peg in 1925.
As the Great Depression took root, however, the Bank of England was forced to choose between providing liquidity to banks and honoring the gold peg.
It opted for the former in 1931.
Yet pound sterling continued to be a major world currency until well after World War II.
Even as late as 1950 – more than a half-century after the US had replaced Britain as the world’s largest industrial power – 55% of foreign-exchange reserves were held in sterling, and many countries continued to peg their currencies to it.
Three things should be clear from this history.
First, a global monetary system based on precious metals does not resolve the fundamental imbalances of a global economic system.
Second, precious metals do not resolve the problem of inflation.
And, finally, the anchor currency and the underlying eco-system of world trade often outlive the geopolitical decline of the anchor country by decades.
A new economic order was established after World War II, with the US as the anchor country.
The Bretton Woods system linked the US dollar to gold at $35 per ounce, with other currencies linked to the dollar (though occasionally allowed to make adjustments).
The flaw in the system was that it underpinned global economic expansion for only as long as the US was willing to provide dollars by running up deficits – the same deficits that would eventually undermine America’s ability to maintain the $35/ounce gold price.
In 1961, the US responded by creating the London Gold Pool, which obliged other countries to reimburse the US for half of its gold losses.
But this arrangement quickly bred discontent, with France leaving the Gold Pool in 1967.
The Bretton Woods system collapsed four years later.
Or did it?
Despite the problems of the 1970’s, the dollar remained the world’s dominant currency, with successive generations of Asian countries pegging their exchange rates to it.
As with the Bretton Woods system, a peripheral economy (for example, China) could grow very rapidly even as the anchor economy (the US) enjoyed cheap financing.
China’s relative rise did not diminish the dollar’s role – and may even have enhanced it.
Indeed, like the Japanese during their period of rapid growth, the Chinese have, until recently, resisted internationalization of the renminbi.
So, are we entering a post-dollar world?
Despite all of the pain caused by the Great Recession, there is no sign that the world is forsaking the greenback.
Investors remain willing to finance the US at rock-bottom interest rates, and the nominal trade-weighted index of the dollar has not collapsed.
Even if China replaces the US as the world’s largest economy within a decade, an anchor currency can be more resilient than the economic and geopolitical dominance of its country of origin.
That is why the dollar will most likely remain the dominant global currency long after the US has been surpassed.

Will the Euro Dethrone the Dollar?
Much of America’s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar’s status as international money.
America’s commitment to free capital markets, the rule of law, and price stability confer credibility on the dollar as a store of value.
But American spending habits have undermined the dollar’s reputation, with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price.
This spring, the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-time high, and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves.
Is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro?
History suggests otherwise, despite a vulnerable dollar.
American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain’s position in world finance a century ago.
Before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions, just as the dollar does today, and the world’s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital.
The British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value.
The “future position of the City of London,” according to Keynes, depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold. Britain maintained the pound’s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the Great War to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange.
The dollar could not challenge sterling’s role as the world’s currency without matching its reputation.
August 1914 provided the opportunity.
The biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America’s ability to repay its debts abroad.
Fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets.
But Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else, except for the British, abandoned their obligations.
Despite the dollar’s instant credibility, however, it took more than a decade for America’s currency to match Britain’s as an international medium of exchange.
Payment habits melt at a glacier’s pace.
Britain’s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling.
The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain’s return to the former $4.8665 parity with the American dollar.
Six years later, in April 1925, Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard. But the pound had already suffered irreparable damage.
The experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency, especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it.
But even then, dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time.
Today, the euro – a currency without a country – lacks a long track record of credibility.
Thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money.
But the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America’s commitment to the dollar.
The European Central Bank, established in 1998, has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability.
But the ECB needs time to establish its inflation-fighting credentials.
It cannot hitch a ride on gold, the way America did a century ago.
So the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar’s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions.
Recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive.
Between 2000 and 2005, the dollar lost more than 25% of its value against the euro.
Meanwhile, the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18% to 24%, and the dollar’s share dropped from 71% to 66%.
In short, the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits, but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar’s dominance, not a revolutionary regime shift.
What might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets?
While a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example, China – appears unlikely, a cataclysmic event, similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange.
In the modern era of automated payments, the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world’s banking system. A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange.
But exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question.
After all, a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect.
Perhaps gold, a store of value impervious to physical distortion, could make a comeback.
Of course, one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture.

Making Net-Zero Pledges Count
OTTAWA – Walking down a Toronto street recently I saw an ad touting a fossil-fuel company’s net-zero credentials.
But to see such belief-straining claims, I would not even need to leave my house.
According to a study by the Guardian and InfluenceMap, such ads are all over Google.
Ads for oil giant Shell, for example, appeared on 86% of searches for “net zero,” with many promoting the company’s pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Are corporations finally waking up to the urgency of the climate crisis, or is this just more greenwashing?
One thing is certain: the climate crisis is escalating fast.
California is enduring record-breaking heat waves.
A third of Pakistan is under water.
China is suffering a withering drought, which may have global ramifications.
And that is just what is happening right now.
From cold snaps in Texas to wildfires in Europe, climate change has become impossible to ignore.
Climate action has come a long way since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015.
Notably, net-zero has gone mainstream, with some 90% of global GDP now covered by net-zero targets.
And it is not just governments that have adopted them; many of the world’s biggest companies have done so, too, motivated by a combination of business interest, investor expectations, and consumer pressure.
But if corporations – including even fossil-fuel companies – are now “climate leaders,” fully and loudly committed to the net-zero cause, why are emissions still rising?
A look at the history of climate action reveals the answer.
Over the last 20 years, a diverse array of climate initiatives has sought to persuade businesses and investors to accept the idea of setting climate-related targets, cutting emissions, and then setting even more ambitious targets.
These initiatives have had one thing in common: all have been voluntary.
As anyone who has ever broken a New Year’s resolution knows firsthand, a promise made is not always a promise kept.
If someone says they will achieve net-zero, how can we be sure that they are taking the steps needed to deliver?
Right now, we can’t.
This has enabled “climate coasting,” with companies marketing themselves as environmentally conscious while continuing with business as usual, or close to it.
In fact, as it stands, only one in three corporate net-zero plans cover the company’s full carbon footprint, including that of its supply chain. And not one of the world’s biggest corporate polluters has fully explained how it plans to achieve net-zero emissions.
As United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recently put it, “The world is in a race against time, and we cannot afford slow movers, fake movers, or any form of greenwashing.”
These are the problems the High-Level Expert Group on Net-Zero Emissions Commitments, which I chair, is meant to solve. We are an independent, diverse group of experts determined to provide science-based recommendations for achieving the goal so many governments and companies have embraced.
Our work is just beginning, but three things are already clear. First, a pledge without a plan is meaningless.
Companies need to align their business strategies with their commitments, take ambitious action, and start delivering progress immediately.
And this does not mean fudging the numbers with questionable offsets; the only credible way to achieve net-zero is to slash emissions.
To support this effort, the High-Level Expert Group will define what it will take to achieve net-zero emissions. This includes establishing clear criteria for credible net-zero plans that account for issues of equity and climate justice.
Regional and sectoral standard-setters can then adopt our criteria, thereby ensuring consistency and comparability.
Second, voluntary schemes are not enough.
We don’t need New Year’s resolutions; we need new business plans.
Regulation will be essential here, both to ensure that voluntary climate roadmaps are replaced by mandatory strategies and to level the playing field.
A central objective of the High-Level Expert Group is to map the needed regulations.
Finally, accountability is essential.
When companies, banks, investors, cities, and regions make net-zero commitments, we must be able to trust them.
Fair rules of engagement will help.
But governments, corporations, and financiers must also embrace radical transparency.
Progress will be easy to spot: investment in clean energy will supersede investment in fossil fuels, and emissions will fall.
Already, our expert group has engaged more than 800 groups, met with thousands of people, and received almost 300 submissions detailing how net-zero commitments can be improved – a clear indication of how keen stakeholders are to get this right.
Success would not only give us a shot at stabilizing the climate; it would bring vast economic opportunities.
According to McKinsey, growing demand for net-zero offerings could generate more than $12 trillion in sales annually by 2030.
Last year, I left politics to dedicate my time to the two things that mattered most to me: my kids and climate change.
The two priorities are deeply interconnected.
If we are to avoid a future where our children are buying “net-zero” bacon between floods and fires, we must close the gap between the promises we hear and the action we need.

China’s Irresistible Rise
LONDON – China’s recently released GDP data for 2017 confirm it: the country’s dramatic rise, with the concomitant increase in its global economic relevance, is not slowing down.
To be sure, there has been fresh media chatter about the reliability of Chinese data, owing to reports that some provinces have been overestimating their economic performance in recent years.
But for all we know, other provinces may have been doing the opposite.
And in any case, the provinces that have admitted to inflating their data are not large enough to have a significant impact on the national picture.
Moreover, two key points are often lost in the debate about China’s official statistics, which the country first starting releasing in the late 1990s.
First, the debate is relevant only if China is increasing the degree to which it overestimates its data.
Second, China’s published data should be considered in the context of its trading partners’ own figures, as well as those of major international companies that do business in China.
As I have written before, it is telling that China has overtaken both France and the United States to become Germany’s top trading partner.
As for the annualized 2017 data, most of the media focus has been on China’s reported real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth, which, at 6.9%, represents the first acceleration in a couple of years and an improvement even on the government’s soft target rate of 6.5%.
But the more important figure is China’s nominal GDP growth translated into US dollars.
Owing partly to a strengthening renminbi, China’s total economic output grew to $12.7 trillion in 2017, representing a massive increase of 13% ($1.5 trillion) in just 12 months.
Clearly, those who have warned that China is following in Japan’s footsteps and heading for a long-term deflationary cycle have been far off the mark.
To my mind, such simplistic comparisons are never particularly useful.
Not only has China averted the risk of deflation; it has done so with an appreciating currency.
When my former Goldman Sachs colleagues and I first started tracking the rise of the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) in the early 2000s, we figured that it would take until the end of 2015 just for China to catch up to Japan.
Yet 2018 has barely started, and already China’s economy is two-and-a-half times larger than Japan’s, five times larger than India’s, six times larger than Brazil’s, and eight times larger than Russia’s.
It is also larger than the entire eurozone.
China’s staggering $1.5 trillion expansion in 2017 means that, in nominal terms, it essentially created a new economy the size of South Korea, twice the size of Switzerland, and three times the size of Sweden.
The latest data suggest that China could catch up to the US, in nominal terms, sometime around 2027, if not before. Within a decade after that, the BRIC countries collectively could catch up to the G7 economies.
Of course, such an achievement would be driven largely by China.
Still, taken together, the remaining BRICs are larger than Japan.
And now that Brazil and Russia have put their recent recessions behind them, the BRICs will likely make a large contribution to nominal global GDP in 2018.
One final consideration for the global growth outlook is the Chinese consumer.
Many commentators still discuss China as if it were solely an industrial power.
But consumption in China has crept up nearly to 40% of GDP.
Since 2010, Chinese consumers have added around $2.9 trillion to the world economy.
That is bigger than the United Kingdom’s entire economy.
British trade negotiators should take note: after Brexit, the Chinese market will be more important to the UK economy than ever.
Yet, in addition to its annualized data, China also recently reported its December data, which revealed monthly reported-retail-sales growth of a slightly disappointing 9.4% year on year.
One hopes that this is a reflection not of a consumption slowdown, but rather of Chinese policymakers tightening financial conditions in the second half of 2017.
Needless to say, as China becomes increasingly important to the global economy, its upside and downside risks will continue to have far-reaching implications for the rest of the world.
And, indeed, a consumption slowdown would be bad not just for China, but also for the rest of the world economy, which is now depending on China’s shift from industrial production to domestic consumption.

Can We Feed the World?
LONDON – In the 1960’s, the Green Revolution – which included the development of high-yielding crop varieties, the expansion of irrigation infrastructure, and the distribution of modern fertilizers and pesticides to developing-country farmers – bolstered agricultural production worldwide.
But chronic hunger remains pervasive, particularly in developing countries, which are affected most by crop shortages and food-price volatility.
By 2050, the global human population is expected to exceed nine billion.
Achieving food security means ensuring that all people have consistent, affordable access to the right nutrients, despite land and water limitations, climate change, and the growing prevalence of resource-intensive Western-style diets that accompany rising incomes.
Surmounting these challenges will not be easy.
But, by taking concerted action to encourage innovation, strengthen market linkages, and support smallholder farmers and women, developing countries can build productive, stable, resilient, and equitable agricultural sectors, achieve sustainable economic growth, and guarantee food security for all.
First, the public and private sectors must ramp up investment in research and development, as well as in the extension and adoption of effective, accessible, and affordable technologies – whether conventional, intermediate, or new platform – according to each country or region’s individual needs.
Given that little suitable land remains unused, and that much of what is being farmed is increasingly degraded and eroded, investment in sustainable intensification (systems for increasing crop yields, while using fewer resources and minimizing environmental damage) is crucial.
For example, conservation agriculture, which aims to reduce or eliminate the need for damaging and labor-intensive interventions like mechanical soil tillage, can increase yields while protecting vulnerable areas from erosion and improving soil fertility. In Zambia, research conducted by local governments, in collaboration with the anti-poverty charity Concern Worldwide, found that new hybrid seeds produced roughly four to five tons of maize per hectare, compared to Africa’s average of one ton per hectare.
Moreover, smallholder farmers – who are essential to productive, stable, resilient, and equitable agricultural development – should be given the needed tools and support to capture more benefits from value chains, while minimizing risk.
This requires building and maintaining fair and efficient input and output markets that connect them – as well as larger-scale farmers – physically and virtually to opportunities to increase their incomes.
The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa has worked with governments, international organizations, charitable foundations, private industry, and farmers’ groups to train and support more than 5,000 agrodealers in eastern and western Africa as they open stores to sell key inputs in small, affordable quantities.
As a result, farmers can travel shorter distances to acquire needed supplies.
In one area of Kenya, farmers who had to travel 17 kilometers to reach an agrodealer in 2004 had to travel only four kilometers three years later.
At the same time, smallholder farmers need easier access to markets to sell their crops for a fair price, rather than relying on expensive middlemen or inefficient government bodies.
An alternative would be to establish some form of cooperative or contract-based farm association that can negotiate fair prices.
Governments must also develop and implement policies aimed at ensuring that those who are typically marginalized from the formal food industry – women, young people, ethnic minorities, and non-landowners – have reliable access to adequate nutrition and opportunities to participate in agricultural production.
As farmers, mothers, educators, and innovators, women provide a critical link between food production, consumption, and future progress on food security. Indeed, giving female farmers access to the same resources as their male counterparts could reduce the number of undernourished people worldwide by 100-150 million.
Finally, political leaders must consistently pursue this agenda at the international, regional, national, and local levels.
To that end, they must honor their commitments – made through international institutions, such as the G-8, the G-20, and the African Union – to increasing investment in agricultural development and to combating global hunger.
Likewise, they must offer sustained support to ongoing national initiatives, thus encouraging further investment and cooperation.
John Kufuor, Ghana’s president from 2001 to 2009, exemplified such leadership, boosting investment in agricultural research, farmer education, and infrastructure projects, such as roads, warehouses, and cold storage.
As a result, the proportion of people living in poverty fell from 51% in 1991-92 to 28.5% in 2005-06. Over the last 25 years, Ghana’s agricultural sector has grown at an average annual rate of 5%.
Such experiences provide grounds for optimism.
By investing in and spreading innovative technologies, strengthening market linkages, encouraging visionary leadership, and targeting those most in need – and thus with the most potential – we can feed the world.

A Two-State Solution for Palestine?
In 1947 Palestinian Arabs and their allies rejected a UN proposal to partition Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state, just as ten years before they rejected a similar partitioning proposed by the Peel Commission.
More recently, both at Camp David and at Taba in Egypt, Arab negotiators again rejected proposals that would have led to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Apparently, many Palestinian Arabs, and much of the Arab world, continue to think that they can do better than a two-state solution.
After decades of conflict, it seems that the Arabs have not given up their goal of making all of Palestine into an Arab state.
True, Arab leaders differ over tactics.
From time to time Arab negotiators enter into discussions about the mundane issues that prospective neighboring states would need to resolve, such as political boundaries, security arrangements, and economic relations. It is possible that at some point the Arabs will agree among themselves that the creation of a Palestinian state that claims to be committed to peaceful coexistence with Israel will be a useful tactic.
American and European governments seem willing to use the carrot of economic aid to encourage this development, in the way that the US pays off Egypt and Jordan to acquiesce in the existence of Israel.
But, unless the Arabs reconcile themselves to the permanent reality of a Jewish state in Palestine, the creation of a Palestinian Arab state will not provide more than the temporary palliative of a tenuous truce between Arabs and Jews.
The Zionist project of creating a Jewish state in Palestine entails a return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland, a land in which Jews lived since biblical times and which the Diaspora never abandoned.
Whether or not this historical justification for Israel's creation is convincing, the important fact is that the Palestinian Arabs and their allies do not buy it.
Arabs express their disdain for Zionism by equating the Zionist project to the creation of a colony, to which millions of Jewish settlers have come.
According to this equation the conflict between Jews and Arabs replicates the conflicts between colonial settlers and indigenous peoples.
If the Arabs believe their own argument that Zionism is colonialism, with themselves as the victims, then, whether or not anybody else accepts this view, the lessons that the Arabs glean from colonial experiences become relevant to prospects for peace between Arabs and Israelis.
Over the years Israeli governments encouraged Arabs to participate in Israel's economy.
This policy, which Israelis view to be benevolent, supposes that economic integration of Arabs and Jews is possible without modifying the Zionist concept of Israel as a Jewish state.
But, from the Arab perspective this policy reinforces their equating of Zionism to colonialism.
Arab rhetoric often takes the colonial experiences of Algeria and South Africa as models for their conflict with Zionism.
These analogies are important because in both Algeria and South Africa, colonialism failed.
Descendants of the European settlers in Algeria fled back to Europe.
In South Africa, Blacks achieved political dominance over the descendants of British and Afrikaner settlers, large numbers of whom remain as a tolerated minority.
A permanent end to the conflict over Palestine will not be possible until the Palestinian Arabs and their allies become convinced that the failure of colonialism in countries like Algeria and South Africa is not a relevant lesson for them.
In other words Arabs will have to become convinced that they can neither subjugate the Jews nor drive the Jews out of Palestine.
The negotiating formula of "land for peace" and "breakthroughs" like the Oslo accords failed to dampen the conflict because the Arabs understandably interpret Israeli concessions as signs of weakness. Unfortunately, the Israelis can show the Arabs that they cannot destroy Israel only by enduring the violent war of attrition that the Arabs are pursuing.
Moreover, there seems no obvious way to speed up the process of convincing the Arabs that Israel is here to stay except by making this war of attrition as costly as possible for them.
But suppose a two-state solution were achieved in the not-too-remote future.
In thinking about this possibility we are drawn to the example of Ireland, where a two-state solution has worked.
Having secured an independent Irish state, Catholics in the Republic of Ireland came to accept the existence of a settler enclave in Northern Ireland.
But, the Irish story has not had a happy ending.
The Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, whose position seems similar to that of the million Arabs who are Israeli citizens, eventually revolted against the dominant Protestants, with decades of violence resulting.
Even if a Palestinian state committed to peaceful coexistence were created, down the road Israel may be unable to avoid the fate of Northern Ireland.

The Arrogance of Chinese Power
NEW DELHI – Success breeds confidence, and rapid success produces arrogance.
That, in a nutshell, is the problem that both Asia and the West face in China, and which has been demonstrated once again at the G20 summit in Canada.
Rising economic and military power is emboldening China’s government to pursue a more muscular foreign policy.
Having earlier preached the gospel of its “peaceful rise,” China is now beginning to take the gloves off, convinced that it has acquired the necessary muscle.
That approach became more marked with the global financial crisis that began in the fall of 2008.
China interpreted that crisis as symbolizing both the decline of the Anglo-American brand of capitalism and the weakening of American economic power.
That, in turn, strengthened its two-fold belief – that its brand of state-steered capitalism offers a credible alternative, and that its global ascendance is inevitable.
Chinese analysts gleefully point out that, after having sung the “liberalize, privatize, and let the markets decide” song for so long, the United States and Britain took the lead in bailing out their financial giants at the first sign of trouble.
By contrast, state-driven capitalism has given China economic stability and rapid growth, allowing it to ride out the global crisis.
Indeed, despite perpetual talk of an overheating economy, China’s exports and retail sales are soaring, and its foreign-exchange reserves now approach $2.5 trillion, even as America’s fiscal and trade deficits remain alarming.
That has helped reinforce the Chinese elite’s faith in the country’s fusion of autocratic politics and state capitalism.
The biggest loser from the global financial crisis, in China’s view, is Uncle Sam.
That the US remains dependent on China to buy billions of dollars worth of Treasury bonds every week to finance its yawning budget deficit is a sign of shifting global financial power – which China is sure to use for political gain in the years ahead.
The current spotlight may be on Europe’s financial woes, but the bigger picture for China is that America’s chronic deficits and indebtedness epitomize its relative decline.
Add to the picture the two wars that the US is waging overseas – one of which is getting hotter and increasingly appears unwinnable – and what comes to mind among China’s leaders is the historian Paul Kennedy’s warning about “imperial overstretch.”
Against that background, China’s growing assertiveness may not surprise many.
Deng Xiaoping’s advice – “Hide your capabilities and bide your time” – no longer seems relevant.
Today, China is not shy about showcasing its military capabilities and asserting itself on multiple fronts.
As a result, new strains are appearing in China’s relationship with the West, and were in full view at last year’s Copenhagen climate-change summit, where China – the world’s largest polluter with the fastest-growing carbon emissions – cleverly deflected pressure by hiding behind developing countries.
Since then, China has added to the strains by continuing to manipulate the value of the renminbi, maintaining an abnormally high trade surplus, and restricting goods manufactured by foreign companies in China from entering the domestic market.
On political and security issues, China has aroused no less concern.
For example, China’s expanding naval role and maritime claims threaten to collide with US interests, including America’s traditional emphasis on freedom of the seas.
Yet the plain truth is that America’s economic and military travails are crimping its foreign-policy options vis-à-vis China.
The US seems more reluctant than ever to exercise the leverage that it still has to press China to correct policies that threaten to distort trade, foster huge trade imbalances, and spark greater competition for scarce raw materials.
By keeping its currency undervalued and flooding world markets with artificially cheap goods, China pursues a predatory trade policy.
This undercuts manufacturing in the developing world more than in the West.
But, by threatening to destabilize the global economy, China threatens Western interests as well.
Furthermore, its efforts to lock up supplies of key resources mean that it will continue to lend support to renegade regimes.
Still, America shies away from exerting any kind of open pressure on China.
US policy today is a study in contrast relative to America’s unabashed exercise of leverage in the 1970’s and 1980’s, when Japan emerged as a global economic powerhouse.
Japan kept the yen undervalued and erected hidden barriers to foreign goods, precipitating strong pressure – and periodic arm-twisting – by the US for Japanese concessions.
Today, the US cannot adopt the same approach with China, largely because China is also a military and political power, and the US depends on Chinese support on a host of international issues – from North Korea and Burma to Iran and Pakistan.
By contrast, Japan has remained a fully pacifist economic power.
It matters greatly that China became a global military player before it became a global economic player.
China’s military power was built by Mao Zedong, enabling Deng to focus single-mindedly on rapidly building the country’s economic power.
Before Deng launched his “four modernizations,” China had acquired global military reach by testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-5, with a range of 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles), and developing a thermonuclear warhead.
Without the military security that Mao created, it might not have been possible for China to build economic power on the scale that it has.
In fact, the 13-fold expansion of its economy over the past three decades generated even greater resources for China to sharpen its military claws.
China’s rise thus is as much Mao’s handiwork as it is Deng’s.
But for Chinese military power, the US would treat China like another Japan.

Éric Zemmour and the Revenge of Vichy
NEW YORK – The French journalist, television celebrity, and possible presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is having great success with his extreme reactionary views.
Zemmour has suggested that Muslims must choose between their religion and France, that the deportation of Muslim immigrants is feasible, and that non-French first names should be banned.
He hates “cosmopolitans” and believes that liberalism is destroying French family life.
Zemmour has been sentenced twice already for racial discrimination and inciting hatred.
His book, The French Suicide, published in 2014, sold more than a half-million copies in France.
Polls suggest that he might get as much as 16% of the vote in next year’s presidential election.
Zemmour’s way of thinking stems from a tradition going back to the French Revolution of 1789.
Catholic conservatives and right-wing intellectuals, who hated the secular republic that emerged from the revolution, have long fulminated against liberals, cosmopolitans, immigrants, and other enemies of their idea of a society based on ethnic purity, obedience to the church, and family values.
They were almost invariably anti-Semitic.
When Jewish army Captain Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused of betraying his country in the notorious scandal of the 1890s, they were on the side of Dreyfus’s accusers
Germany’s invasion of France in 1940 gave reactionaries of this kind the chance to form a French puppet-government in Vichy.
Zemmour has had kind things to say about the Vichy regime.
He also has expressed some doubt about the innocence of Dreyfus.
None of these views would be surprising if they came from a far-right agitator like Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But Zemmour is the son of Sephardic Jewish immigrants from Algeria who lived among the Muslim Berbers.
Because of the French reluctance to make ethnic or religious distinctions between citizens, Zemmour’s background is often ignored.
But it might help to explain why he arrived at his extreme opinions.
There is of course no reason why a Jewish person should not hold conservative views.
And many Jews are passionately patriotic about their countries.
But nativism among Jews in the diaspora is exceedingly rare, for obvious reasons. (Israel is a somewhat different story.)
Hostility to immigrants and insistence on national purity have never done Jews any good.
This is perhaps the main reason why American Jews, for example, unlike prosperous members of other minorities, such as the Irish, Italians, and increasingly Latinos, still consistently vote for Democrats.
For a long time, many diaspora Jews have been keen to assimilate and become indistinguishable from the majority population.
As with other minorities, this is often a matter of class: relative prosperity loosens the ties to traditional faiths and customs.
But even the most ardent French, British, or American Jewish patriots tend to support their societies’ openness and oppose anti-immigrant bigotry.
In France, such patriots would be mostly on the side of universal human rights and other French republican values.
This would apply, for example, to the well-known philosopher Alain Finkielkraut, the son of a Polish father who survived Auschwitz.
Finkielkraut fears the dangers of Islam no less than Zemmour, but he is not a nativist.
The Islamic threat, in his view, is to the liberal, secular, republican ideas that Zemmour deplores.
So, what drives Zemmour?
How can a Jew become an anti-Dreyfusard, as it were?
Perhaps the memories of the Nazi genocide and the Vichy regime’s complicity have faded so much that even a Jewish intellectual can flirt with nativist reaction without any sense of shame or fear.
Or maybe he believes that stirring up French hostility to Muslims will deflect potential aggression against Jews. Many French Jews, especially the mostly Sephardic Jews living in poor neighborhoods, live in genuine fear of Muslim anti-Semitism.
Zemmour is an extreme assimilationist.
He cannot stop talking about his ardent love of France.
Again, there is nothing unusual about that.
But his family roots among the Berbers are a complicating factor.
Zemmour’s attitudes are not unique to France, or to Sephardic Jews.
In the Netherlands, for example, one thing some of the most fervent opponents of Muslim immigration have in common is a family history in Indonesia, the former Dutch East Indies.
Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigrant Party for Freedom, is partly Eurasian.
So are some other prominent figures in Dutch far-right politics who have an obsession with Islam.
Racial hierarchies in the former colonies were complex.
Eurasians in Indonesia, especially those with a Dutch education, were not just keen to be thought of as Europeans, but were fearful of being identified as Asians – let alone Muslims.
Many Algerian Jews were just as eager to identify as French, and living among Muslims could easily result in hostility.
Muslims in Europe not only are resented, but some Eurasians in Holland or Jews in France are terrified of being associated with them.
The closest parallel might be the attitude of certain assimilated Western European Jews before the war to poor Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.
But that was more a matter of snobbery than hatred.
And fellow Ashkenazi Jews were not feared.
Zemmour’s hostility to Muslims has made him popular with some French Jews who have been shocked by recent acts of Islamist violence – including the murder of a rabbi and three children in Toulouse, the stabbing of an elderly Jewish woman in Paris, and other incidents.
But Zemmour also has given license to bigotry among Gentiles.
Le Pen himself put this succinctly in a recent interview with Le Monde.
Because Zemmour is a Jew, Le Pen said, nobody could accuse him of being a Nazi, and “that gives him great freedom.”
By extension, it gives more freedom to people who think like Le Pen.

Holocaust Denial, Nuclear Denial
What connects Iran’s nuclear ambitions and Holocaust denial?
With equal fervor, Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, defends his country’s right to develop its nuclear capacity (though denying that his country seeks nuclear weapons) and challenges decades of Holocaust research.
How should Ahmedinejad’s denial that Iran intends to pursue nuclear arms be judged in light of his Holocaust denial?
Journalists ask, but Ahmedinejad won’t answer.
His argument is that Iran does not want nuclear weapons, and would not use them to duplicate a crime that did not happen.
Some westerners, while lamenting Ahmedinejad’s insensitivity, have struggled to minimize the significance of his Holocaust denial as the fulminations of a misguided fanatic (as if misguided fanaticism were an incidental quality in a nation’s president).
This misses the point.
Holocaust denial is not an argument about the past.
It is an argument about the future.
The point of Holocaust denial is to remove the taboo now associated with the original crime.
For deniers, the problem is not that the Holocaust occurred, but that most people still consider it to be a bad thing.
Thus, Auschwitz is dismissed as a “detail of history,” in the telling phrase of the French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.
What Holocaust deniers seek most is to undo the idea that Nazi crimes should have any impact on current international relations or on global notions of morality.
Ahmedinejad made this point repeatedly in interviews with western media and in long letters to US President George W. Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He has even done the math: sixty years have indeed passed since the Holocaust ended, five times the actual period of Nazi rule in Germany.
So, it is time, he wrote Merkel, to “make the shadow of World War II disappear.”
Unsurprisingly, he has Israel in mind.
But Ahmedinejad’s obsession with Israel blinds him to any understanding of what actually happened across Europe during WWII – and to the fact that present-day Europe was constructed over the six decades since then as a response to this historical disaster.
In writing to Merkel, he is addressing the leader of a country decimated by Nazi rule – millions dead, an entire society and economy reduced to rubble.
Had she been politically active during the Nazi times, Merkel would have landed in a concentration camp.
Yet Ahmedinejad, referring to Europe’s response to the Holocaust, asks her to imagine “what standing some European countries could have had and what global role they could have played, if it had not been for this 60-year-old imposition.”
Germany does not seem to have done too badly in these 60 years, but consider the core of this “imposition”: the effort to give enduring political expression to the moral concepts of good and evil that the Nazis tried to invert.
As a policy, the Holocaust was premised on denial – the physical denial of any legitimate religious, racial, or political difference within Nazi Germany.
The means of this denial were the annihilation of offending populations – the Jews foremost among them – in a merciless attempt at social purification.
The intent of the crime was so ambitious, and its scope so great, that a new word – genocide – was coined to describe it.
Modern media played a role, too, broadcasting images of the death camps that immediately came to symbolize the depth of Nazi depravity.
The enduring impact of the Holocaust, explored in hundreds of books and films, was to portray Nazism as the ultimate expression of evil.
In this context, to deny the Holocaust is to reject its modern association with evil, and implies that what happened during the Holocaust could be accommodated under a different moral order.
Ahmedinejad argues that outside pressure, not the actual historical experience of total war, keeps the memory of the Holocaust alive in Europe.
What he doesn’t understand is that the memory of Auschwitz is also the memory of the Battle of Britain, the bombing of Dresden, the occupation of Paris, and the Warsaw uprising.
Auschwitz did not occur in a vacuum.
It was the furthest extreme of a disaster that incorporated all these other events.
If the Holocaust did not happen, or if it has no meaning, then how is the rest of modern European history to be understood?
If there were no crimes, then the Nazis were not criminals.
Ahmedinejad feels the power that comes with re-writing history.
He enjoys taunting the West with the past that he denies.
He understands the temptation of evil, the lure of forgetfulness.
Above all, he is a practical man.
It does Ahmedinejad no good for Europe to maintain a sense of history that must put it at cross purposes with Iran.
Ahmedinejad’s purpose is simple: find the weak spots in the chain that links Europe to its past and, through this past, to Israel and the US.
Europe’s choice is equally clear: to accept absolution for this past from the president of Iran, or to determine whether the standard of truth that he applies to history is the same as he applies to nuclear weapons.

Making Impact Investing Work
NEW YORK – There is a growing consensus that capitalism needs to be reimagined.
The influential Business Roundtable in the United States recently issued an appeal for corporate CEOs to think about their impact on all stakeholders, not just their financial shareholders.
Equally, we have no hope of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals unless private capital is mobilized to complement public funding. Many believe that so-called impact investing can be part of the answer.
The idea is not a new one.
True, most people used to think about their finances as having “two pockets” (as Ross Baird of Blueprint Local puts it).
One pocket was for fiduciary investments geared toward making as much money as possible, regardless of social or environmental considerations.
The other pocket was for philanthropic efforts aimed at doing as much good as possible, while disregarding financial returns.
But the ends of the “spectrum of capital” started to merge in the 1950s.
At that time, some purely fiduciary investors – namely, faith-based communities, civil rights organizations, and labor unions – realized that certain investments were morally repugnant or misaligned with their values.
Chief among these were holdings in companies manufacturing tobacco products, producing pornography, or doing business in apartheid South Africa.
In 1968, the Ford Foundation pioneered a new tool known as program-related investment, which used low-cost loans as a substitute for grants to affordable-housing developers. Ford realized that by designing an investment to “crowd in” private capital, it could leverage comparatively scarce philanthropic funding by a factor of three- or four-to-one and still see a return of principal.
Thus, a $10 million philanthropic budget for affordable housing might translate into tens or hundreds of millions of investment dollars.
Then, in the 1990s, some intrepid investors, recognizing that simply excluding bad categories of investments from their portfolios was not enough, took program-related investing a step further. They focused on the connection between superior returns and how a company manages environment, social, and governance (ESG) issues.
The early evidence from this approach suggests that treating employees well, pursuing boardroom diversity, and managing a firm’s environmental footprint can indeed have a positive impact on financial returns.
Finally, in the early 2000s, a number of investors – including Bridges Fund Management in the United Kingdom, DBL Partners and SJF Ventures in the US, and Acumen Fund and Root Capital in emerging markets – recognized that another broad change was underway.
A new generation of entrepreneurs was building businesses with the explicit intent of solving pressing social and environmental problems.
And it soon became apparent that investing in such companies could have real-world impact and bring outsize financial returns.
After nearly two decades of toiling in the wilderness, these organizations have continued to grow and gain credibility.
What was once considered niche is now becoming mainstream.
But with the rush of capital into impact investing, higher standards are needed.
Specifically, three things must happen for impact investing to realize its full potential.
First, the industry needs more agreement on standards for assessing claims of impact, as well as mechanisms for independent verification. Slapping a “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDG) or “ESG” logo on your fund’s prospectus does not make you an impact investor.
Credible claims of impact should follow from rigorous due diligence, clear performance measures, consultation with end beneficiaries, accurate and independently verified reporting, and relevant sector benchmarking.
In this respect, the Impact Management Project’s recent efforts to harmonize the alphabet soup of impact acronyms (such as IRIS, GIIRS, PRI, and GRI) are promising. But now we need to move from theory to practice; that is, from PowerPoint slides to user-friendly, cost-effective tools that are available to every asset manager and entrepreneur.
And even with these harmonized standards and tools in place, we will need to ensure that impact claims are as legitimate as the reporting on formal financial statements.
Second, industry players must commit to recruiting a generation of talent that is proximate to the problems being addressed.
A corps of predominantly white, male finance professionals based in Midtown Manhattan or Mayfair, London, will not understand the intractable global challenges that impact investments are supposed to tackle.
Moreover, there is ample evidence to show that diverse teams tend to outperform homogenous ones. Asset owners, fund managers, and entrepreneurs must be representative of the communities being served.
Finally, as investors allocate funding to new impact- and sustainable-investing strategies, they also must account for the potentially negative effects of the rest of their portfolios. If a $1 billion green fund serves as cover for an additional $99 billion still invested in companies extracting fossil fuels or relying on exploitative supply chains, then impact investing will have failed.
Likewise, philanthropic institutions and universities also must “look under the hood” of their endowments for investments that may run counter to their missions.
Rather than being a fig leaf, impact investing must be the thin end of the wedge, opening a space for traditional investors eventually to apply environmental- and social-impact assessments to every asset in their portfolios.
Will the next chapter be about real change at scale, or will the mainstreaming of impact investing be a hollow gesture?
The stakes are high.
But with operational definitions of impact, a new generation of talent, and a much wider lens, investing in our shared future might just become the future of investing generally.

Homegrown Energy Security for Europe
COPENHAGEN – The European Union is highly dependent on foreign oil.
For every 100 liters consumed within the EU, 90 are imported.
Meanwhile, domestic oil production is plummeting, down more than 50% over the last decade.
Unless the EU changes course and increases its production of alternative energy – including biofuels, an option the EU has long neglected – some 95% of its oil will come from foreign sources by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.
The current state of affairs remains the EU’s Achilles’ heel, because it implies dependence on imports from unstable, authoritarian regimes.
In 2014, EU member states spent a staggering €271 billion on foreign crude oil – more than the combined GDP of Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia.
Roughly half of this money went to Russia, the Middle East, and North Africa.
Thus, not only is the EU exposed to global supply disruptions; it is also helping to prop up authoritarian governments and empower hostile regimes, which limits its own ability to provide effective, coordinated responses to threats and provocations.
The EU’s struggle to devise coherent political and economic strategies to confront the challenges posed by Russian aggression in Ukraine and the inferno in the Middle East is a case in point.
The United Kingdom’s recent decision to boost defense spending highlights the growing recognition that strong military capabilities will be needed to uphold Europe’s security and sovereignty.
But as long as its dependence on foreign oil persists, the EU will remain far weaker than it needs to be.
The proposed Nord Stream II pipeline – which would funnel even more gas from Russia to Germany – is only likely to aggravate the situation.
Europe’s energy security is likely to gain salience in the coming months, as 2016 shapes up to be another turbulent year in international politics.
This year is also likely to see the completion of the EU’s Energy Union, established to ensure secure supplies of affordable, climate-friendly energy.
Unfortunately, Europe’s dependence on foreign oil has been left out of the discussion. The European Commission must provide clear direction if EU member states are to develop alternative sources of energy.
Renewable energy from wind and sun can certainly play a role in decreasing the EU’s energy vulnerability.
Such sources are already helping to reduce dependence on coal and gas for electricity production.
However, when it comes to energy production from oil – most notably fuel for cars – it is likely to be years before wind or solar energy can provide viable alternatives.
The EU should follow the example set across the Atlantic, where countries have worked to reduce their reliance on foreign oil.
The United States, for example, has created incentives for investment in alternative fuels.
Indeed, the US is the world’s largest producer of bioethanol, which – along with the production of shale gas – has helped reduce foreign oil imports by at least 25%, while lowering carbon dioxide emissions and creating local jobs.
Brazil, too, provides a compelling example, having worked since the oil crises of the 1970s to reduce its reliance on imported energy.
Today, Brazil is a net oil exporter and the world’s second-largest producer of bioethanol, which has replaced more than one-quarter of the gasoline once used in the country.
Unfortunately, much of the policy discussion surrounding biofuels in the EU is dominated by outdated arguments linking them with rising food prices. Food should not be used to fuel cars, opponents insist.
Today, however, advanced biofuels are not based on food, but on waste from industry, agriculture, and private households.
In the words of José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, biofuels “can be an effective means to increase food security.”
Done right, their development would mean “more fuel, more food, and greater prosperity for all.”
Biofuel technology kills four birds with one stone: It improves energy security, recycles waste, reduces greenhouse-gas emissions, and produces jobs (often in rural areas).
That is why replacing imported oil with homegrown energy is one of the most important and far-reaching legacies today’s Europeans could leave to the Europe of tomorrow.

The World’s Biggest Shock Absorber
MUNICH – Since last autumn, Germany has been accused by a number of Anglo-American economists, above all by the 2008 Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, of not doing enough to combat the world economic crisis and of free-riding on other countries’ stimulus programs. Recently, The Financial Times asked where the German economists are who defend Germany’s policies, voicing the presumption that they disagree with their government’s policies but are too cowardly to say so publicly, thus conforming to the rituals of the German “consensus society.”
From a German point of view, this discussion is a ludicrous inversion of the truth.
At first glance, this is indeed less than the American program, which totals 6.2% of GDP, of which 2% will be spent in 2009. But this impression is deceptive, since the German state, through the built-in flexibility of its extensive social-welfare system, already contributes to stabilizing the world economy.
Indeed, Germany’s generous unemployment insurance policies ensure that people are able to maintain their consumption standards even if they lose their jobs.
Germany even has short-time allowances that enable companies to reduce their employees’ working hours, with the loss in earnings partly reimbursed by the state.
Without this short-time allowance, the average number of unemployed in 2009 would be 300,000 higher than it is now.
At the same time, more than 40% of Germany’s adult population (pensioners, social-welfare recipients, unemployed, accident victims, students) receives some form of state transfer income, especially those in eastern Germany, while the burden of taxes and social security contributions on those in employment is high.
While this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and causes great structural problems, it also means that the state reacts extremely counter-cyclically and stabilizes the economy to a great extent, which benefits the entire world.
The German state recorded a budget deficit of just 0.1% of GDP in 2008, which, according to a recent OECD forecast, will soar to 4.5% of GDP in 2009.
Thus, the economic stimulus provided by the German state budget will amount to 4.4% of GDP in 2009.
In the United States, the budget deficit in 2008 stood at 5.8% of GDP, and, according to the same OECD forecast, will amount to 10.2% of GDP in 2009, which translates into exactly the same economic stimulus as in Germany, 4.4% of GDP.
In addition, Germany has much more inner stability than the US, because it does not have the problem of heavily indebted households that are now restricted in their borrowing.
German banks grant mortgages only to a maximum of 60% of the value of a house, instead of the 100% mortgages that were frequently seen in the US and United Kingdom.
Likewise, there is also virtually no credit card debt in Germany, or other reasons for US-style household indebtedness. A normal German household is not on its last financial legs, and is therefore able to compensate for income losses by adjusting its savings.
This is an additional reason why private consumption in Germany, according to last week’s joint forecast by Germany’s leading economic institutes, will increase by 0.3% in 2009 in the midst of the worst post-war economic crisis, whereas private consumption is in freefall almost everywhere else in the world.
Germany is the world’s second largest importer, closely behind the US.
Thus, the stability of German consumption is currently the world economy’s strongest economic pillar.
Whereas German exports are falling at an annual rate of 20%, the portion of imports that does not consist of intermediate products for export goods is stable, helping the world as a whole.
The data clearly supports this view.
According to the OECD, the annualized flow of German goods exports from January 2008 to January 2009 declined by $173 billion more than the corresponding flow of imports fell, which means that Germany’s annualized trade surplus fell by the same amount.
This is the strongest decline in net foreign demand facing a single country, or, equivalently, the strongest increase in a country’s net demand for foreign goods.
Japan, for example, has confronted only a $157 billion decline in its annualized trade balance.
During the same period, annualized US imports declined by $284 billion more than US exports, and China’s annualized trade surplus increased by $249 billion.
In other words, from January 2008 to January 2009, the US withdrew $284 billion and China $249 billion in annualized demand from the world economy, whereas Germany provided $173 billion and Japan $157 billion in annualized demand stimulus to the world economy.
For Europe’s bigger countries, the picture of annualized demand in the same period is mixed.
While Italy, like Germany and Japan, has added demand, totaling $6 billion, Spain has withdrawn $101 billion, the UK $50 billion and France $19 billion.
The $7 trillion decline in US house prices over the past two years was equivalent to the explosion of an atomic bomb.
Germany, Japan, and other countries absorbed and mitigated the shock waves. So, instead of belittling German efforts, the world should show Germany a little more gratitude.

The Kingdom’s Botched War in Yemen
CANBERRA – Despite more than five years of military intervention in Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition’s campaign has failed to save the country from disintegration.
The Southern Transitional Council (STC), backed by the United Arab Emirates, now occupies the important port of Aden, and, to the dismay of Saudi Arabia, has declared self-rule over the south.
But this de facto partition ultimately may not reduce instability in Yemen and the region.
In fact, Yemen already is effectively divided into three territorial entities.
The Saudi-backed government of President Abdu Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, now exiled, and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels control the other two.
This has prolonged the fighting – described as “a civil war within a civil war” – with profound geostrategic implications.
The conflict has persisted since early 2015, when the Arab coalition, comprising of Saudi Arabia and eight other countries, including the UAE, launched a massive military intervention.
The main architect was Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), now the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
A crucial supporter was the equally forceful Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ), Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
MBS’s objective was twofold.
One was to strengthen his position within the royal family in order to succeed his father, the aging King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud.
The other was to restore Hadi’s rule, which ended in September 2014, when fighters from the minority Zaidi-Shia Houthis took over Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, and drove him out. MBS also wanted to demonstrate to Shia Iran that Sunni Saudi Arabia – the site of Islam’s two holiest shrines – would no longer be a passive power and would not tolerate expansion of Iranian influence in the region, especially up to the Saudi border.
MBS’s anti-Iranian aim resonated with MBZ and other allies, who formed a counterweight to the Islamic Republic.
US President Barack Obama’s administration was in the process of negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, which was signed in July 2015.
While the ongoing talks made Obama hesitant about the Saudi-led intervention, America’s traditional alliance with the kingdom won out, and the US backed the coalition.
Saudi Arabia expected that armed intervention and aerial bombing would defeat the Houthis and restore Hadi’s rule in Sana’a within weeks.
But they underestimated the social and political complexity of a country that had reunified only in 1990, when the communist south joined with the Saudi-backed north.
Northern Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh played a key role in reunification and led united Yemen with an iron fist until 2012, when a popular uprising forced him to hand over power to Hadi.
But Saleh’s political demise soon led to political, social, and sectarian fragmentation, as groups from the Houthis to al-Qaeda filled the power vacuum.
The Saudi-led intervention has been costly in both human and economic terms for all sides.
Although no official figures have been provided, the war’s cost is estimated to have been more than $100 billion up to 2018, with substantial troop and military hardware losses.
The damage that the conflict has inflicted upon the Yemeni people has been astronomical.
According to the United Nations, some 112,000 have been killed, including 12,000 civilians, with almost 70% of civilian deaths due to coalition air strikes.
Moreover, 80% of the country’s citizens – 24 million people – need humanitarian assistance, and the UN reported in 2019 that almost ten million were “one step away from famine.”
There has been extensive physical destruction, too.
The mounting casualties and humanitarian crisis prompted Obama to become critical of the Arab coalition’s operations, and in December 2016 he halted the sale of some arms to Saudi Arabia.
Obama’s successor, Donald Trump, reversed course and has provided the Saudis both weapons and carte blanche in Yemen.
And yet Trump’s target, Iran, has reasons to feel strategically resilient.
The Houthis now command a large chunk of Yemen along the Saudi border, and the STC has chipped away the South.
Meanwhile, Hadi’s forces hold smaller areas, which must trouble not only MBS, but also Trump, who alleges that Iran is the source of all problems in the region and must be contained at all costs.
For most of the war, MBS was trying to consolidate power at home.
Despite growing international criticism of the military campaign and rifts within the Arab coalition – especially between the kingdom and the UAE – MBS was unwilling to recognize the futility of the venture.
This was consistent with his determination to override all other criticism, including of his alleged authorization of the October 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul and the arrest of potential opponents within the Saudi royal family.
The war may be in a new phase.
While the Saudis prefer an end to the STC’s control over the south, there are signs that they are retreating, following a broken ceasefire and the crumbling of the Riyadh Agreement, a peace deal brokered in November 2019.
The kingdom’s allies and enemies will not relent in their quest for supremacy in both the north and south, even as the COVID-19 pandemic bears down on the country (the first case was confirmed last month).
Partition is unlikely to serve the cause of stability and security in Yemen.
But it provides an opportunity for MBS and Trump to take stock of their policies, which have exacerbated uncertainty in the Gulf.
There are no easy fixes.
But only by backing UN-led peace talks between the warring parties will it even be possible to achieve a political settlement that spares the region further power rivalries – and further bloodshed.

Barroso Overboard?
BRUSSELS – It is time for José Manuel Barroso to start selling himself.
His chances of being re-appointed as President of the European Commission depend on the case he makes.
Until the global financial crisis broke, Barroso looked fairly certain to get a second five-year term.
Now, it is becoming increasingly hard to find diplomats or policymakers who support him.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is said to have been disappointed by Barroso’s performance during last autumn's financial meltdown, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also seems to have fallen silent on the matter of his future.
No one doubts that Barroso is in an awkward position.
The European Commission has few powers of its own with which to confront the recession as it spreads throughout the European Union; most powers belong to the European Central Bank.
But the Commission does have a voice with which to rally people, and it is for their silence that Barroso and his fellow commissioners are being rebuked.
The perceived lack of leadership from the Commission at this time of deepening economic gloom is just the tip of the iceberg.
The events of recent months have crystallized more deep-seated concerns.
When Barroso, the former Portuguese prime minister, was awarded the EU post by his fellow heads of government, he appeared to be a dynamic new broom who would sweep away the cobwebs left by his predecessor, Italy’s Romano Prodi.
But, with the passage of time, the Barroso-led Commission has also come under fire for being unadventurous and lacklustre.
Even before the clouds of recession began to gather, Euroskepticism was on the rise, with the Commission blamed, rightly or wrongly, for the EU’s failure “to reach out to the citizen.”
The job of Commission President is arguably among the most difficult in the world.
The institution has been in near-imperceptible decline for almost 20 years, thanks to the rise of the European Parliament and the way EU member governments have whittled away its authority while consolidating their own powers as the EU’s true legislators.
Yet the head of the Commission is called upon to be the dynamic public face of Europe.
The Commission’s own internal culture of cautiousness and red tape is a constraint that nobody in Brussels much likes to talk about. It is not a structure that is conducive to political coups de theâtre , and most of the Commission’s work is the relentless grind of EU regulation and re-regulation.
But the bottom line is that at a time when everyone is asking, “What is Europe doing?”, the Commission’s responses have seemed inadequate.
For reasons that are now obscure, there is an unwritten rule that Commission presidents must be drawn from the ranks of past or current prime ministers.
This has in large part accounted for Barroso’s high hopes of getting a second term.
There was, it appeared, no other credible candidate to challenge him.
For his part, Barroso is widely seen as having avoided controversy throughout 2008 in order not to risk offending any governments that might have been inclined to block his reappointment.
That seeming passivity is now his greatest problem.
France’s presidency of the EU during the second half of 2008 showed that dynamic leadership is a quality widely appreciated by the European public. With his sense of showmanship, Sarkozy almost effortlessly eclipsed Barroso when handling the Russia-Georgia crisis in August, followed by the EU’s responses to the autumn crisis of cascading bank collapses.
The Commission was left on the sidelines.
What is to be done?
France’s successful presidency has intensified doubts about the effectiveness of the Commission and its president, so much so that even in Paris concerns are being voiced that the Brussels executive must somehow be strengthened if it is not to become a mere secretariat.
EU governments have wanted a pliable Commission, but now the cost could be the death of the “community method” that protects the EU against national frictions.
Barroso needs to respond to all these doubts.
If he is to reassure EU national leaders that they should re-appoint him, then he needs to signal that his second term can hold out fresh promise.
He is good at giving upbeat speeches, but this will not be enough.
Some sort of plan is needed.
When he arrived in Brussels in 2004, Barroso was repeatedly asked whether he had a “big idea” for Europe’s future.
Back then, he did not need one to be appointed.
This time, he must produce one if he is to save his skin.

Who's to Blame for Britain's Euro Allergy?
Forty years ago, Charles de Gaulle said "Non" to Britain's request to join the European Community.
By June 9, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will offer his own "No" to Europe.
But Britain's decision whether to join the single European currency, the Euro, was taken long ago, and it was always going to be some version of "No."
When France first invited Britain to join the infant European enterprise, a decade before General de Gaulle barred the door, the supercilious mandarins in Britain's Treasury ensured that Britain would indignantly reject the offer.
Treasury bureaucrats have remained predictably anti-European ever since.
Like the courtiers who surrounded Louis XVIII, they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing.
The only question now in doubt is whether Brown's verdict on the Euro will be "Not quite yet," "Not before the next election," or just plain "No."
It is a decision being taken virtually independently of Prime Minister Tony Blair, and even against his wishes.
Blair believes that Britain ought to join the Euro, because he wants Britain to be, as he puts it, "at the heart of Europe".
Most commentators tended to assume that, if that's what Tony Blair wants, then sooner or later that is what will happen, because, after all, he is the Prime Minister.
The flaw in this reasoning is that Blair surrendered control of the single currency decision to the Treasury early in his first term, and he has never had the courage or political strength to take it back.
It is sometimes said that Tony Blair is instinctively European (though that is said less often since the Iraq war).
But when he came to power, in 1997, he was not able or willing to face down Britain's traditional anti-Europeanism; in particular, he was not prepared to commit his government to eventual Euro membership.
Blair's solution to his Euro dilemma was to pretend that adopting the Euro was not a major political decision, but a technical question, to be decided on "purely" economic grounds.
So, in October 1997, Gordon Brown announced that he had devised five tests to see whether Britain and the Euro were suited to each other. In due course, the Treasury would reach a judgment that would be technically expert, economically impartial, and politically neutral.
If Tony Blair ever believed any of this, he was a fool.
Brown claimed that his five tests would produce answers that were plain and unambiguous.
Yet, because they were all questions about the future, they would inevitably be based entirely on speculation.
Where Gordon Brown himself really stands on the issue is unclear, because he is a deeply secretive man. Many believe that his primary concern in the Euro debate is over how it affects his power vis-à-vis Blair.
In any event, once the decision of principle had been subordinated to ostensibly technical economic tests, it was unavoidable that Treasury mandarins, who are institutionally opposed to European integration, would conduct them.
So the verdict was always going to be "No," which is why the only freedom of movement for Blair and Brown was going to be "Not yet."
Of course, there is not and cannot be an overpowering economic case for joining the Euro, at any time. Imagine that the British government decides one day to go for Euro membership, and to put the issue to the test of a referendum.
At the moment, the electorate is hostile to Euro membership by a large margin; if the government is to persuade the voters to change their minds on purely economic grounds, it must deploy a powerful case.
Voters will not be impressed by the Treasury's mumbo-jumbo; they will need strong, simple arguments that Britain will be better off by joining.
If the British economy and the Euro-zone economy are both doing well, the economic case for British membership is obviously weak. The same is true if the British economy and the Euro-zone economy are both doing badly.
If the British economy is doing well and the Euro-zone economy is doing badly, there is no economic case whatsoever for British membership.
That is the current situation.
The only scenario in which there could be a strong, purely economic case for Euro membership is one in which the Euro-zone is doing very well, the British economy is doing very badly, and membership looks like the best way to deliver long-term recovery.
But if the British economy were doing very badly, the other member states might snub Britain. Obviously, "doing well" and "doing badly" are clumsy notions; but we are talking about a referendum, not about higher mathematics.
A referendum on joining the Euro probably cannot be won unless a British government is willing to say three things: first, that it favors closer EU political integration; second, that the single currency is but one expression of that integration, and third, that it is committed to Euro membership.
Curiously, many voters who oppose Euro membership nonetheless believe that it will happen. No doubt they would prefer the government to tell them the truth first.

Hot Memory/Cold Memory: The Political Half-Life of Fascism and Communism
<d>
Demonetization Dos and Don’ts
CAMBRIDGE – On November 8, at 8:15 in the evening, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced that, at the stroke of midnight, all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes in circulation would no longer be considered legal tender, and would need to be exchanged for new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes.
Modi’s “demonetization” intervention affected 85% of the money in circulation in India.
It was an unprecedented move, whether in India or almost anywhere else, and it is by far Modi’s boldest policy intervention to date.
The Modi government is targeting the “black money” associated with tax evasion, corruption, and counterfeiting, and thus the drug traffickers, smugglers, and terrorists who engage in those activities.
India’s tax-paying salaried classes and even the poor initially welcomed the policy enthusiastically, viewing it as sweet revenge against tax evaders who had stowed away their ill-gotten gains; they reveled in anecdotes of corrupt officials burning bags of cash or throwing money into India’s rivers.
But with each passing day, that initial cheer diminishes.
Public frustration is now mounting, because the government has failed to meet the demand for new printed notes.
Commerce in India – where the cash-to-GDP ratio is 10% – relies heavily on cash transactions, and informal-economy and small-business operations have now ground to a halt, owing to long lines and tight cash-withdrawal limits at banks and shortages at ATMs.
The near-term impact will be the equivalent of an “anti-stimulus” policy intervention, and the consequent drag on demand will be significant.
Moreover, as real-estate prices decline, so, too, will household wealth.
Although lower house prices will make new homes more affordable, the stock of occupied homes will far exceed new purchases in the near term, so the negative-wealth effect will overwhelm the gains.
Given these large upfront costs, it is reasonable to ask how effective demonetization is in fighting tax evasion and corruption, and if there is a less costly approach to demonetization.
Back in 1976, in an article entitled “How to Make the Mob Miserable,” the American economist James S. Henry addressed the question of effectiveness, prescribing demonetization as a measure to undermine mafia operations.
But policymakers did not take his proposal seriously.
Henry’s proposal was, in his own words, “dismissed as either administratively impractical or as a one-shot action that would have no long-run impact on criminal behavior.”
In a new book, The Curse of Cash, Kenneth Rogoff champions the elimination of high-denomination notes in order to fight tax evasion and criminal activity. Rogoff furnishes extensive evidence that making it costly to hoard cash would deter illegal activities.
While tax evaders also store their wealth in non-monetary forms, such as land, art, and jewelry, cash remains a leading vehicle for ill-gotten gains, owing to its inherent liquidity.
In other words, questions posed by Modi’s critics about the role of cash in feeding stockpiles of black money are misplaced.
That said, Rogoff proposes a different strategy to address the menace of black money – one that would be minimally disruptive and arguably more effective, at least in the long run.
That strategy would depart from the Modi government’s intervention in two fundamental ways.
First, it would be gradualist, implemented over several years.
Second, it would permanently eliminate high-denomination notes.
While this gradualist strategy would not punish existing hoarders, who would find creative ways to recycle their cash in the interim, it is more likely to improve tax compliance and reduce corruption over time, as large-denomination notes are permanently taken out of circulation.
India’s current policy of replacing 1,000-rupee notes with 2,000-rupee notes undermines the long-term effectiveness of its policy.
Moreover, the gradualist approach is administratively practical, minimizes the collateral damage to the real economy and ensures that there is enough time to extend financial services and financial literacy to larger parts of India.
Over the last two years, the Modi government has made an impressive push for financial inclusion with its Jan Dhan program, which has facilitated the creation of 220 million new bank accounts. But many people who create accounts do not necessarily use them.
A 2015 World Bank study of bank-account usage and dormancy rates across different regions found that only 15% of Indian adults reported using an account to make or receive payments.
In this environment, a cash scarcity is economically crippling.
Modi’s policy intervention is bold, and the economic principles motivating it are beyond reproach.
But a gradualist approach that includes the permanent withdrawal of large notes would have served the cause better, even if it did not generate the same “shock and awe” as the current policy.
This will become more apparent as the large costs to the economy emerge over the next several months.

NATO Must Be Saved
Whoever thought that NATO - that most successful expression of transatlantic solidarity - had found new cohesion after the divisive Iraq crisis should visit the alliance's headquarters. True, the Istanbul summit in late June produced a veneer of harmony, and NATO headquarters is, as usual, busying itself with frequent meetings of now 26 national delegations, innumerable committees, and the mountains of printed paper it churns out.
Something essential, however, is missing: NATO's spirit.
Many, if not most, of the members no longer recognize NATO as central to their national interest.
As one high official puts it, the organization is like the old and bruised car one keeps for as long as it functions but will dump when repairs get too costly. There is still some use to be had from the old vehicle: it leads some 6000 troops in Afghanistan, assures a fragile security in Kosovo, and may, as was decided by NATO in June, be helpful in training Iraqi forces.
NATO is still nice to have around.
But, with the exception of those who have only just joined, few governments on either side of the Atlantic seem to fear major disaster if it gently faded away.
That, not the falling-out among major allies over the Iraq War, is the cause for the deep crisis the modern world's oldest and most successful alliance now finds itself in.
The policy differences over America's Iraq adventure exacerbated the crisis, but also obscured its true cause.
This explains why neither the US, nor its opponents or supporters in Europe, ever sought a thorough discussion of the operation in the NATO Council before, during, or after the Iraq war - they realized their views were already too far apart to be reconciled.
That is also why the modest efforts now being undertaken by the alliance to assist America in trying to stabilize Iraq will not stitch NATO back together again.
To be sure, the US administration has now asked all of NATO for help, in marked contrast to its haughty claim only two years ago that NATO as such no longer mattered; not membership in the alliance, but a particular military mission, would henceforth define the coalition.
Yet, for most of the allies, this new approach is merely tactical, a sign of Yankee pragmatism when the situation demands it, not of a change of heart on the part of the Bush administration to rebuild NATO as the central plank of the transatlantic partnership.
Nor do European governments display any such urge.
Summit communiqués have become modest if wordy affairs.
Even where members have committed themselves to a joint operation, as in Afghanistan, NATO's able new Secretary General, former Dutch foreign minister Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, has to plead for a few helicopters here, a few hundred men there, like the manager of an impoverished football association trying to put together a team.
NATO's crisis of confidence and cohesion stems from the Cold War's end, not from the turbulences of the Iraq War.
The alliance can claim important achievements over the past 15 years: it helped to stabilize Europe as it enlarged to 26 members, almost double the Cold War number; it kept the Balkan conflict under control; it even accepted a role in extra-European security contingencies such as Afghanistan.
But NATO has failed the most important test, namely to ensure that its members continue to see its success as essential to their interests.
That they no longer do so is deeply disturbing.
It reflects less on the shortcomings of the organization than on the shortsightedness of its members.
True, their security from military attack is currently no longer at stake.
But NATO is more than just a defense pact.
Like no other institution, NATO embodies Atlantic cohesion, something that remains essential for any Western effort to promote a degree of international order.
NATO links Europe to the world's most powerful country and uniquely ties the United States to a common procedure of consultation and cooperation. Moreover, it is the only organization capable of generating international military operations for the many stability-building tasks that lie ahead.
European governments, therefore, are crazy not to support NATO.
To watch it wither is at best frivolous, at worst dangerous.
Instead of blaming the Bush administration and hoping for a change of government in the US, European members need to make NATO their own concern again.
This does not imply kowtowing to every American view and whim or foregoing efforts to strengthen European defense cooperation.
It does mean undertaking to make NATO again the place where both sides of the Atlantic develop a common approach to the dangers of this world.
Unfortunately, most European governments merely shrug their shoulders when the issue is raised.
That dangerous indifference is the most serious sign of NATO's crisis.

The Message of Croatian Elections
ZAGREB: Barely two months after Franjo Tudjman's death, Croatia is a different country.
Years of political fear have been washed away in just a few days.
Last month, parliamentary elections dealt a mortal blow to Tudjmans' monolithic party, HDZ.
This week, the opposition's Stipe Mesic won Croatia's presidency.
Tudjman, long an object of dread, has vanished from the political screen, taking into oblivion the ideological clutter that made Croatia a pariah state.
Despite an electoral law favoring it, Tudjman's mammoth organization has been reduced to a mere 40 seats in the 151-seat lower chamber of the Sabor (parliament). The coalition of Ivica Ra an's ex-Communists (SDP) and Drazen Budiša's right-liberals (HSLS), known as §the Two", hold 71 seats.
The allied coalition of §the Four ¨ (Peasant Party, Liberal Party, National Party, and the Istrian regionalists), which together with "the Two ¨ make up a new governing coalition called §the Six", won an additional 24 seats, meaning that the new premier, Ivica Račan, a former head of Croatia's defunct League of Communists and the man who yielded power to Tudjman in 1990, has a comfortable majority, but not the two-thirds needed to change Tudjman's constitution of excessive presidential power.
The consequences of HDZ's collapse shaped the presidential contest.
HDZ's candidate, Tudjman's reputedly moderate foreign minister Mate Granic, whom pundits declared an easy winner, confronted two adversaries – Drazen Budiša, the candidate of §the Two", and Stipe Mesic, whom §the Four ¨ put forth almost as an afterthought.
Stipe Mesic edged Granic out of the race in the first round (24 January) and defeated Budiša decisively in the second round (7 February).
Mesic's astounding victory speaks volumes about the current mood of the Croat electorate.
Mesic is an unassuming populist involved in the Croat opposition movement since the 1960s.
From a Communist family who witnessed the murder of his grandmother by the collaborationist Ustašas as a child, he belonged to the reform wing of the communist party in 197.
Afterward, in a period of hard-line communist reaction, he became a political prisoner, even a non-person.
He joined with Tudjman and the national movement in 1989, becoming Prime Minister, and briefly, as Croatia's representative in 1991, served as ex-Yugoslavia's last collective president.
But he soon fell out of Tudjman's favor.
He spoke against the repression of Serbs and broke with Tudjman over Croatia's aggression in Bosnia.
He shared the seeming isolation of Tudjman's harshest critics, becoming a member, but not the paramount leader, of the small Croat National Party – an organization clearly in opposition but otherwise nondescript.
Quite courageously, Mesic stuck his neck out by testifying in the Croat cases at the Hague tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and by pursuing his own brand of reconciliation politics in Bosnia and Montenegro, activities that many thought would kill off his chances in electoral politics.
This raises an interesting question: was the downfall of Tudjmanism postponed by the opposition's fear of appearing more radical than was believed to be practical?
It has long been suspected that the Croat electorate was more daring than the opposition parties.
Now that the electorate has rewarded the radical Mesic over the overcautious Budiša, this assessment has acquired an instant patina.
Admittedly, Mesic had the advantage of being the temperamental opposite of Tudjman.
Where Budiša shared with Tudjman the air of being a national monument, something compounded by his prissy and high-strung demeanor, Mesic was unconventional and homespun.
At a time when the electorate wanted somebody unlike Tudjman in ideas and bearing, Mesic was the logical choice.
This might not be the best news for §the Two ¨ – the SDP-HSLS part of the new ruling coalition.
Ra an had the bad sense to publicize his lack of enthusiasm for a possible Mesic victory.
Only Budiša, he said, could guarantee the changes promised by the new government.
Forgetting that but for a timely death they would have had to share power with Tudjman for two more years, §the Two ¨ attempted to compel Mesic to agree to reducing many presidential prerogatives immediately after the elections.
Mesic remains uncommitted here.
He senses that the electorate is uneasy with the growing arrogance of §the Two ¨, a tendency that has not been mitigated by early and decisive actions that might augur better times. With HDZ and its extreme-right appendages out of the way, Croatia now lacks a convincing opposition.
Racan's insistence on unanimity is an echo not only of Tudjman, but also of Racan's own communist past.
Mesic could now galvanize §the Four ¨ to cohere around a program that is more European, more market-oriented, more liberal, more sensitive to Croatia's regions, and more pluralist than what "the Two" can offer.
This would be good for Croatia.
This is a society that needs diversity of opinion more than anything else.
There is a lesson in Croatia's seemingly precipitous changes for the Balkans and other troubled regions in post-communist Europe.
Admittedly, Croatia's problems never were as severe as those of the countries further east.
Still, the successes and longevity of ideologues like Tudjman could be more apparent than real.
They are most successful when they dominate not only their own movements, but the opposition's agenda as well.
It may sound archaic in high-tech politics of the new millennium, but the ability to deflate the ideological boasts of nationalist prophets by old-fashioned and straightforward opposition is the key to change.
Mesic triumphed over Tudjmanism when he professed a complete lack of interest in the chimera of Greater Croatia.
He refused to underwrite an expansionist blank check and he was not punished by the electorate for any lack of patriotic ardor.
For oppositions, this is not a road without risks, but it is one worth taking. Western political leaders grappling with this part of the world should also learn not to settle for second best.

Central Europe’s Unsentimental Education
BUDAPEST – This month marks the 20th anniversary of the reburial of Imre Nagy, the leader of Hungary’s failed anti-Soviet revolution of 1956.
The reinternment, organized by Hungary’s anti-communist opposition on the 31st anniversary of his execution, drew more than 100,000 attendees, heralding the beginning of the end of the country’s sclerotic regime.
We Hungarians, and Central Europe in general, have come far since those heady times, but the past 20 years have also given us much cause to question the path we took.
Hungary played a special role in the collapse of Communism, accelerating the process by opening its borders for East German refugees.
But democratic transformation in Hungary required an opposition strategy throughout the 1980’s: revolution wouldn’t work, as the Soviet invasion in 1956 showed.
Nor would internal reforms work, because the Soviets would intervene to save the system, as they did in 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
Instead, the new strategy was to sideline the issue of political power.
Rather than attacking Communist rule directly, we would create small islands of freedom, inter-connected social circles and associations, which, when the moment came, could all be connected in order to change the system. In Hungary, several youth organizations existed and were aware of each other, so the political community that took part in the political changes in Hungary in 1989 was organized on this basis.
History also played a part in the success of the Hungarian transition.
The 1956 revolution was a real one, with barricades.
In no other Central European country did Communists experience the possibility of paying with their own lives for the suffering and oppression that they inflicted on others.
This historical experience was good for reform capability.
A new generation was also needed.
It appeared symbolically on June 16, 1989, when I had the opportunity to speak on behalf of the young generation.
A whole generation felt that the moment had come when Hungarians could at last determine their own future.
So, what kind of future did they determine?
The past 20 years can be divided into three phases.
First, a market economy was created, the rule of law established, and democratic institutions built.
Next, we applied for admission to NATO and prepared for European Union membership, with all of the institutional reforms that these goals implied.
The third phase was one of economic catch-up, which, unlike the first two phases, has not really been successful in Hungary, which today may even be falling back.
But, for Central Europe as a whole, the past 20 years have been the best since the Peace of Westphalia, with Slovakia and Slovenia even joining the euro zone.
Nevertheless, the 20th anniversary of the collapse of communism is overshadowed by the global financial and economic crisis.
And it is now clear that the biggest winners of globalization are no longer the Europeans or the Americans, but the Asians.
The world market is being re-divided – peacefully, because territories and markets are separated, so that no power occupies another power’s territory.
But Europe must nonetheless recognize the need to distinguish clearly between partners, competitors, and opponents, and to formulate a more sophisticated and articulated policy towards Russia, in particular.
For example, we Central Europeans are opponents when we do not accept Russia’s policy of renewing “spheres of interest” and “security zones.”
Moreover, after all that has happened in the past six months, Central Europeans can no longer look up to old countries representing the moral values of Western civilization.
This crisis was not caused by bad luck or some professional misunderstanding, but by character problems, especially in the United States and later Western Europe.
Money was stolen, not merely “mismanaged.”
Investments were not simply bad, but unacceptably risky.
The moral state of business leaders caused this crisis, and you cannot find Central Europeans among those leaders.
Central Europe has found itself in a completely new situation.
Crisis management measures undertaken in the Western world are practically cutting our countries off from the EU market.
In this situation, Central European countries must cooperate to defend their own interests, as well as their dream of a common Europe.
The question for the European elite is whether we believe in the work of the past 20 years, whether we believe in an integrated European market and an ever-widening European Community.
If not, then first the biggest and the strongest countries, and then the Central Europeans, will turn away from the European dream.
Those of us who believe that the past 20 years made sense, and that we are on the right track, are still the majority in Hungary.
Everyone in Europe and the world needs a unified, robust Europe.
If our faith is strong enough, we can survive this crisis without destroying what we have built together by opening our borders, destroying the Wall, unifying Germany, and completing our democratic transitions.

Europe in Reverse
BERLIN – The legendary American investor Warren Buffet once said, “It’s when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swimming naked.”
That particular piece of wisdom referred to the situation of companies in an economic crisis. But it can also be applied to countries and economies.
In Europe, the situation is cause for growing concern, because the global economic crisis is relentlessly laying bare the European Union’s flaws and limitations.
Indeed, what Europe lost, first and foremost, with the rejection of the constitutional treaty is now obvious: its faith in itself and its common future.
Amid this worst crisis since 1929, America has opted for a truly new beginning with the election of Barack Obama, and is now in the process of reinventing itself.
By contrast, each passing day seems to drive EU members further apart.
Rather than reinventing itself, Europe, under the pressure of the crisis and its own internal contradictions, threatens to revert to the national egoism and protectionism of the past.
Europe today has a common currency and the European Central Bank (ECB), which have proven to be bulwarks in defending monetary stability during the financial crisis.
Any weakening of these two institutions would cause severe damage to common European interests.
But EU member governments’ behavior during the past few months raises grave doubts about whether they see things this way.
The longer the crisis continues, the more obvious it becomes that the common currency and the ECB alone are not enough to defend the Common Market and European integration.
Without common economic and financial policies, coordinated at least between the members of the euro zone, the cohesion of the common currency and the EU – indeed, their very existence – are in unprecedented danger.
To be sure, the crisis has placed a stranglehold on countries worldwide.
But there are significant differences and economic imbalances within the EU and the euro zone, reflected, for example, by increasingly divergent interest rates.
Confidence in Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece is rapidly evaporating, while the stronger economies in northern Europe are doing better, although they are struggling, too.
Should this continue, perhaps bringing a de facto end to the Maastricht criteria and rising national protectionism in the form of industrial subsidies, the euro will be seriously jeopardized.
It is easy to imagine what the euro’s failure would mean for the EU as a whole: a disaster of historic proportions.
Moreover, the new EU member states in Eastern Europe, which have neither the economic strength nor the political stability of long-term members, are now beginning to take a nosedive.
Given the exposure of some euro-zone states such as Austria, this crisis will also affect the euro area directly. To wait and see is, therefore, the wrong strategy.
There is no reason to believe that the current global economic crisis has bottomed out.
So, assuming that it intensifies further, Europe will rapidly face a grim alternative: either the richer and more stable economies in the North – first and foremost Europe’s largest economy, Germany – will use their greater financial resources to help the weaker euro-zone economies, or the euro will be endangered, and with it the whole project of European integration.
Why not, then, quickly introduce new instruments such as Eurobonds, or create an EU mechanism comparable to the IMF?
Each would certainly be costly – particularly for Germany – and therefore would be anything but popular, but the alternatives are much costlier; indeed, they are not serious political options.
Institutionally, there is no way around a “European economic government” or “enhanced economic coordination” (or whatever you want to call it), which in fact would be possible informally and thus without any treaty change.
Unfortunately, it has become clear that the Franco-German engine, which is crucial to the EU acting in unison, is momentarily blocked.
Their rhetoric suggests that France and Germany have a great deal in common, but the facts speak a completely different language.
In nearly all strategic aspects of EU crisis management, Germany and France are blocking each other – although ironically, both are doing virtually the same thing.
They are thinking first and foremost of themselves, not of Europe, which is thus effectively without leadership.
The EU was and is institutionalized compromise, and must remain so now, in the midst of a global economic crisis.
If Germany and France don’t quickly resolve their differences and find a joint strategic answer to the crisis, they will damage themselves and Europe as a whole.
It must never be forgotten that the EU is a project designed for mutual economic progress. If this economic bond disappears, national interests will reassert themselves and rip the project apart.
Europe today does not lack economic strength, but rather the political will to act in unison.
Here is where Germany and France must lead the way.

Trump, Syria, and the Threat of Region-Wide War
BEIRUT – The die, it seems, is cast for a rapid end to the United States mission in Syria – and, with it, the chances of a peaceful and sustainable resolution to that country’s brutal seven-year civil war.
The chemical attack allegedly carried out last week by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Douma, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region, shows just how dangerous that prospect is for Syria and the world.
US President Donald Trump’s bluster in the wake of the chemical attack exposes the incoherence and contradictions of his approach, as well as his lack of any real strategy in Syria.
Ordering an attack or two against Assad’s forces, as he might do, would neither alter the balance of power there, nor improve Trump’s position in the war-torn country, let alone the Middle East in general.
To be sure, Trump’s top military advisers have persuaded him to keep in place the 2,000 military personnel currently stationed in Syria.
But he has already limited America’s objectives there to eliminating the small remaining Islamic State (ISIS) presence – an effort that should take about six months.
In constraining America’s commitment, Trump has forfeited the opportunity to help shape Syria’s future, reinforcing the widespread perception – which has taken hold among friends and foes alike – that US global leadership is in retreat.
He has also disregarded the country’s ongoing humanitarian crisis, the worst since World War II.
Ironically, this narrow approach also undermines the effort to achieve Trump’s sole objective, as a lasting defeat of ISIS and other jihadists will demand a credible political transition that permanently ends the civil war.
Such a transition will be possible only through diplomatic engagement by actors with stakes in Syria.
With Trump’s withdrawal implying that the US and its allies have lost the war, Assad already feels emboldened to forge ahead – with Russian and Iranian support – with his plan to recapture the remaining rebel-held territories at all costs.
After establishing “facts on the ground,” Assad and his allies would be able to present the world with a fait accompli: Assad remains in power, without making any real concessions to the opposition.
Local and regional actors that placed their faith in America’s commitments will pay a bloody price.
In particular, the Kurds – America’s most reliable and effective ally in the fight against ISIS – are likely to be left out in the cold, despite official US assurances about security arrangements after the US withdrawal.
Already, Kurds have criticized the Trump administration for sacrificing them at the altar of America’s strategic relations with Turkey.
The US turned a blind eye to Turkey’s recent invasion and occupation of the Kurdish-held city of Afrin in northwest Syria, which led to the slaughter of more than 1,000 Kurds, including scores of civilians.
With a US withdrawal, the Kurds may feel compelled to ally with Assad for protection.
Hundreds of Kurdish fighters have already deserted the fight against ISIS in northeast Syria, journeying to Afrin to resist the joint assault by Turkey and a splinter group of Syrian rebels.
Some young Kurds have begun to join Assad’s paramilitary units to avenge the loss of Afrin.
But it will be a difficult battle, as America’s departure is likely to strengthen Turkey’s hand further.
After all, without the US, the other main foreign powers in the Syrian conflict – Turkey, Russia, and Iran – will be able to consolidate their spheres of influence and divide the spoils of the post-war reconstruction among themselves.
While their specific interests may differ, all three countries share a vision of a “soft” partition of Syria that reduces Assad and the rebels to mere proxies.
Russia and Iran will be the two biggest winners.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is the kingmaker whose timely military intervention saved Assad’s regime from defeat and turned the war’s tide in his favor.
Whereas the US is almost nowhere to be seen in Syria, Russia is everywhere, constantly rearranging the pieces on the conflict’s chessboard.
Russia’s coordination with all major regional powers – including Turkey, a NATO member – attests to the dynamism (and cynicism) of the Kremlin’s foreign policy.
As the US pulls up stakes in Syria, Turkey’s military and economic ties to Russia will only deepen.
Like Russia, Iran has invested plenty of blood and treasure to save Assad’s regime – and reaped handsome returns.
Iran is now the most influential regional power in Syria, as it is in Iraq and Lebanon.
But the rush to fill the vacuum left by the US might provide the spark that ignites a region-wide war.
There are legitimate concerns that Israel might use the withdrawal of US troops as a pretext to intensify its attacks on Iran and Hezbollah in Syria – a decision that could escalate into all-out regional conflict, one that draws in the US, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main rival for regional hegemony.
Even leaving aside Trump’s hostility to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement – which adds yet another source of risk to an already perilous situation – there is now a real and present danger that Syria will become the site of a conflagration even more destructive than the one raging there since 2011.

The Bank of Japan’s Moment of Truth
TOKYO – The Japanese economy has enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of positive growth, with the average annual rate reaching 1.9%. With aggregate demand exceeding potential output by 1%, the country’s “GDP gap” is now positive.
Unemployment is down to 2.7%, the lowest level since 1993, and the job-opening-to-application ratio is 1.56, its highest level since 1974, resulting in acute labor shortages in several sectors, including construction, retail, and package delivery.
And in January this year, the Nikkei Stock Average rose above ¥24,000 ($216), its highest level since 1991.
But, while these indicators suggest that Japan is finally out of the woods of more than two decades of stagnation, deflation, and economic insecurity, the headline inflation rate, at just 0.6%, remains far below the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.
And, notably, while the BOJ had been attributing low inflation to falling energy prices, energy is now contributing positively to inflation.
When fresh food is excluded from the price index, the rate rises to 0.9%, but falls to 0.3% when also excluding energy.
Considering the current labor shortages, why Japan has not experienced a healthy wage-inflation spiral remains a mystery.
To be sure, inflation is also missing in the United States and Europe.
But the Japanese case is particularly striking.
Japan’s real economy has been supported for years by fiscal deficits as high as 6% of GDP, and by extraordinary quantitative easing (QE), which BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda introduced in April 2013.
The debt-to-GDP ratio has since risen to 230%, and the BOJ has assumed ownership of more than 40% of outstanding government bonds (JGBs).
The BOJ has maintained its negative policy rate and 0% ten-year-bond rate by purchasing annually ¥80 trillion in JGBs and ¥6 trillion in equities.
But, more recently, it has kept the ten-year-bond rate at 0.0-0.1%, while reducing the pace of new purchases of JGBs to around ¥50 trillion, in what some regard as a stealth tapering.
With Kuroda’s term ending in early April, two camps of critics have become increasingly vocal.
The first camp, arguing that the real economy is what matters, wants the BOJ to stop providing stimulus and start worrying about its bloated balance sheet.
When the inflation rate moves closer to the target, the BOJ will have to start raising its policy and long-term rates without adjusting the size of its balance sheet – which is exactly what the US Federal Reserve is already doing.
Given the low average coupon rate of asset-side long-term bonds, the upward shift of the yield curve will result in a loss for the BOJ (“negative seigniorage”), at least temporarily.
In the worst-case scenario, the BOJ could exhaust its capital and require a fiscal injection, which could jeopardize its independence.
Accordingly, the first camp believes the inflation target should be lowered to 1%.
Inflation would then be on target, and the BOJ could wind down its QE program.
The major drawback of this approach is that it would cause the yen to appreciate sharply, striking a blow to the real economy.
The second camp believes that more stimulus is needed, and that increasing the consumption-tax (VAT) rate in April 2014 was a huge mistake, as is stealth tapering. Instead, QE and expansionary fiscal policies should remain at full throttle until the 2% inflation target is reached.
That means more government expenditure through more JGB issues, to be purchased by the BOJ – also known as “helicopter money.”
The problem is that intentionally blowing up the budget deficit will increase the risk of a fiscal crisis down the road, without helping the real economy.
When the BOJ held its latest policy-setting meeting on January 22-23, it maintained the approach it has followed for more than a year.
Kuroda and his deputy governors are probably hoping that the real economy’s strong performance will translate into higher inflation soon.
But will it?
Generally, three keys to higher inflation are wage increases, resulting from labor scarcity; expectations of higher future inflation among the public; and a favorable external environment.
With respect to wages, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has been pressuring major corporations to raise wages by 3% or more.
That should be manageable, considering that many corporations are enjoying record profits.
And yet unions in Japan remain timid, and workers remain traumatized from 15 years of deflation.
As a result, many choose job security over pay hikes.
Demanding higher wages, they fear, would give companies an excuse to move operations abroad or adopt labor-replacing technologies.
As for the second ingredient, the BOJ has admitted that it underestimated the difficulty of influencing inflation expectations when it introduced its QE program in April 2013.
In Japan, the expected inflation rate, however it is measured, tends to track the actual inflation rate, albeit with some lag.
This helps to explain why simply announcing a 2% target has not anchored the public’s expectations, as it has in the US.
At the same time, the external environment is promising.
Almost every other advanced economy is experiencing steady, synchronized growth.
And emerging economies, especially China, have also regained strength.
At the level of the global economy at least, the stars seem to be aligned for inflation to reach the 2% target rate in Japan, the US, and the eurozone.
In Japan, the Phillips curve tends to be L-shaped.
Right now, the economy is very close to the kink in the “L,” the point known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).
Any sign of a vertical move (implying higher inflation with an unemployment rate at NAIRU), rather than a horizontal one (a lower unemployment rate without CPI inflation), will be welcomed by the BOJ, and good for the economy at large.

Endorse the Nuclear Test Ban
STOCKHOLM/MEXICO CITY – Indonesia’s parliament has just taken a historic step, one that makes the planet safer from the threat of nuclear weapons.
The importance of Indonesia’s decision to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty cannot be overstated.
This is a golden opportunity for the remaining eight countries to endorse the CTBT, enabling it to come into legal effect.
For the five decades following World War II, a nuclear test shook and irradiated the planet on average every nine days.
This era was ended in 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.
But, for the CTBT to enter into force, all 44 states specified as holders of nuclear technology must ratify it.
Until they do, the specter of nuclear testing will continue to haunt us.
It is urgent that the CTBT take full legal effect around the world as soon as possible.
A complete ban on all nuclear explosions would hamper the upgrading of existing nuclear arsenals and the development of new weapons, diminishing the capabilities of both current and potential nuclear-armed states.
The CTBT reinforces both nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, and is essential for global, regional, and national security.
We applaud the fact that all of the nuclear-capable countries in Europe and Latin America and many in other regions in the world have ratified the CTBT.
With Indonesia’s ratification, the number of countries that have yet to do so has decreased to eight: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea, and the United States.
These countries have a responsibility to make the legal ban on nuclear testing a reality.
We strongly urge them to reconsider the CTBT; this important instrument for peace and security will bring us a step closer to a world without the threat of nuclear weapons.
The CTBT has already had a dramatic impact, despite not yet being in force.
Since its adoption, nuclear testing has virtually stopped, and all 182 signatory states have abstained from testing nuclear explosives.
The three countries that have failed to ratify the CTBT and have tested such devices – India, Pakistan, and North Korea – have faced universal condemnation from the UN Security Council, and UN sanctions.
A key measure of the viability of any arms-control treaty is how effectively it can be verified.
In this respect, the international community has a formidable instrument at its disposal.
The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is creating a verification regime that has repeatedly proven its reliability in detecting even small underground nuclear tests.
In addition to its verification mandate, the CTBT monitoring system also helps to mitigate disasters.
During the tragic catastrophe in Japan last March, CTBTO data helped local authorities to issue timely alerts.
The CTBTO continued to help by monitoring the global dispersion of radioactivity from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant.
Mexico and Sweden are longstanding supporters of the CTBT.
Over the coming two years, our countries will jointly oversee the process of bringing the CTBT into force.
We pledge to spare no effort to advance this aim.
We vow to:
· Call upon political leaders in the states that have not yet ratified the CTBT to act without delay and take concrete steps to this end;
· Encourage civil-society groups – NGOs, media, universities, and youth organizations – in these countries to urge their decision-makers to ratify the CTBT;
· Use national, regional, and international meetings and conferences to promote the CTBT at every level of decision-making;
· Complete the CTBTO’s verification regime, which all states should support as a powerful deterrent to any would-be nuclear testers.
It is time to end this destructive experiment and close the door on nuclear testing once and for all.
We appeal to decision-makers in the eight states that have not yet ratified the CTBT to move forward.
Indonesia has set an example; now the spotlight is on you.

Can the US Win the New Cold War?
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – US President Joe Biden has framed America’s confrontation with China and Russia as an open-ended contest between democracy and autocracy.
If that is true, an American victory will depend not only on the country’s ability to outcompete its adversaries, but also on its success at safeguarding democracy at home.
On the former imperative, the United States is well-positioned to succeed, thanks to a series of diplomatic masterstrokes.
For starters, at the recent G7 and NATO summits, Biden cemented a broad alliance spanning Europe and Asia against Russia and China.
This follows the quick mobilization of Western governments to support Ukraine and punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war he launched there in February.
Biden has also taken advantage of Chinese aggression toward its neighbors to consolidate American alliances in East Asia.
The Quad – comprising Australia, India, Japan, and the US – has been deepening its strategic cooperation.
In short, the Biden administration has proved its ability to rally America’s democratic allies abroad to stand up to their autocratic adversaries.
At home, however, the pillars of America’s democratic institutions are crumbling.
Despite his election defeat in 2020, Donald Trump maintains a viselike grip on the Republican Party.
Some 70% of Republican voters still believe Trump’s lie that his loss was due to massive electoral fraud.
Unwilling to risk losing support, nearly all congressional Republican leaders either parrot these lies or maintain a cowardly silence.
Meanwhile, Republican leaders are effectively taking a sledgehammer to the pillars of US democracy.
In 2021, at least 19 states – all but two of them Republican-controlled – enacted 34 laws to restrict access to voting.
And a month before the 2020 election, congressional Republicans pushed through the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, despite having refused even to hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee during President Barack Obama’s final year as president.
This points to the most alarming recent development for US democracy: the politicization of the US Supreme Court.
Now packed with far-right justices, the Court issued a series of radical rulings last month that undermine women’s rights, environmental protection, and public safety, while severely damaging its own standing as an independent institution.
As bad as things are, the crisis of American democracy may be just beginning.
The Republican Party seems likely to regain control of Congress in November’s midterm elections.
And there is no telling what the 2024 presidential election will bring.
One cannot rule out the possibility of Trump returning to the White House – a development that would put US democracy in grave danger.
It is not hard to explain why Biden is winning the cold war abroad, but losing the fight for democracy at home.
The US and its allies are still far ahead of their autocratic adversaries in critical areas, not least military and technological capabilities.
Moreover, Russia and China consistently engage in the kind of aggression and bullying that drives smaller countries into the arms of the US.
To defend American democracy, however, Biden – and US democrats more broadly – must overcome structural obstacles embedded in the country’s constitution.
By design, the US system gives some voters far more influence than others.
Most glaringly, while seats in the House of Representatives roughly correspond to a state’s share of the US population, all states get two seats in the Senate.
Today, Republicans hold 50% of the Senate’s seats, but represent only 43% of the US population.
Americans in less populous states also have more power over the executive, because the president is elected indirectly, via the Electoral College. Trump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2000 – both Republicans – won the presidency despite having lost the popular vote.
This structural advantage means that Republicans face less pressure to temper their extremism; they can pander to a radical minority, and still wield just as much power as Democrats.
Republicans also benefit from a poisoned media environment in which firms like Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News reap massive profits by promoting lies and conspiracy theories.
Here, the structural impediment to change would be relatively easy to address: pillars of the US financial establishment like BlackRock and Vanguard – two of Fox’s biggest investors – need only stop investing in firms that are systematically undermining American democracy.
But there is no reason to think that they will.
None of this bodes well for America’s prospects in the new cold war.
Yes, there is still a chance that the Democrats can retain enough power to defend American democracy.
In this case, the US could continue to build on the positive momentum the Biden administration has generated with its recent foreign-policy maneuvers.
But if the Republican Party continues its assault on US democracy – a foregone conclusion, if it takes Congress and/or the White House in the coming elections – the US will, at the very least, lose its ideological appeal.
It might still manage to rally its democratic allies to challenge China and Russia, but only on the basis of narrow national interests, rather than shared values. What is now an ideological struggle between democracies and autocracies could thus become an all-out clash of global titans.
That is best-case scenario.
In the worst case, the consolidation of minority rule and the rise of an illiberal regime in the US could unleash civil unrest, pitting a de facto disenfranchised majority against an increasingly authoritarian minority.
It is hard to imagine that a country beset by such turmoil could possibly lead a coalition of democracies on the world stage.

China’s Unavoidable Financial Rise
SHANGHAI – The great powers in history have tended to have one thing in common: size matters.
While a large market does not guarantee dominance in other realms, it certainly helps, perhaps more than any other single factor.
This was true of the United States, and now it applies to China.
Beyond being a leading economic and trading power, China is increasingly – and inexorably – becoming a global financial power.
Somehow, too many economists in the West did not see this coming.
Even a decade ago, few were bullish about the growth of China’s external financial strength, with skeptics highlighting the country’s vulnerabilities.
A rare exception is Brown University’s Arvind Subramanian.
In his 2011 book Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance, Subramanian argued that China’s dominance was not only more imminent, but would also be broader than virtually anyone expected, involving huge financial influence among the domains that China would reshape.
Given his prescience, the title of the Chinese translation of his book – The Big Forecast – might have been more apt.
Why did Subramanian see so clearly what most economists didn’t?
His model, unlike the standard analytical framework of economics, included the variable of size.
A decade later, China’s financial influence is becoming impossible to ignore.
In the 20 months beginning on April 1, 2019, 364 renminbi-denominated onshore Chinese bonds – issued by China’s government and “policy banks” – were added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index.
The first time domestic Chinese bonds were included in a major global index was a milestone in the opening up of China’s financial markets.
And it was followed by more progress, with JP Morgan adding Chinese government bonds to its flagship index in the first quarter of 2020.
FTSE Russell will follow suit, beginning later this year.
With that, Chinese bonds will be included in all three of the major bond indices tracked by global investors.
It should not be surprising, then, that the RMB Globalization Index, which measures growth in offshore renminbi usage, reached new highs this year, following three years of 40% annual growth.
The rapid internationalization of China’s bond market has accelerated the internationalization of the renminbi – a process the government has long sought to facilitate.
In 2010, China allowed central banks, renminbi offshore clearing banks, and offshore participating banks to invest in China’s interbank bond market.
China launched the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014 and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect two years later.
Both use a two-way renminbi-settlement system.
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has also allowed eligible foreign institutional investors to access the China Interbank Bond Market directly, without quotas or restrictions, since 2016.
And in 2017, it established China Bond Connect, which gives overseas investors access to fixed-income markets in mainland China via trading infrastructure in Hong Kong.
These efforts are bearing fruit.
According to the Financial Times, overseas investors have bought a net $35.3 billion worth of Chinese stocks through the Shanghai- and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connects so far this year, an annual increase of about 49%.
As of July, they held more than $228 billion in renminbi-denominated A-shares of China-based firms through these channels.
Moreover, overseas investors have purchased more than $75 billion worth of Chinese government bonds this year, up 50% year on year, and about $578 billion in Chinese bonds through the China Bond Connect channel.
Foreign investors now hold a total of $806 billion in Chinese stocks and bonds, up 40% from a year ago.
Ultra-loose monetary policy in the US and the European Union during the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly helped to fuel this surge in purchases of Chinese assets.
A huge amount of money is flowing out of the US and the EU, and China is a safer destination for it than other emerging-market economies.
But that does not mean this is a short-term trend.
The annual Global Public Investor Survey, published by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, shows that 30% of central banks plan to increase their renminbi holdings in the next 12-24 months, compared to 10% last year.
In Africa, almost half of central banks plan to increase their renminbi reserves.
As a result, the renminbi’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves is on track to rise at an average annual rate of roughly one percentage point for the next five years.
Research by Goldman Sachs and Citi predicts that the renminbi will be among the world’s top three currencies within a decade.
As China opens its capital markets, it is also quietly pushing forward the development of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY.
The CBDC is currently being tested in a representative sample of ten key cities, placing China well ahead of the vast majority of other central banks: while 80% have begun to design a digital-currency system, only 16% of them have reached the pilot stage.
China has also been developing a digital cross-border payment system.
Now, the PBOC has joined with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of Thailand, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates to launch a multilateral research project, Multiple CBDC Bridge, which will explore ways to incorporate digital currencies into cross-border payment systems.
While the e-CNY is currently being positioned as a cash-payment voucher, its potential is huge.
As China’s Belt and Road Initiative facilitates an increase in trade and investment flows, the e-CNY will expand the renminbi’s use in settling cross-border transactions, reduce dependence on the US-led SWIFT network, and lay the groundwork for the establishment of a more convenient regional digital-currency payment network led by China.
Most importantly, the e-CNY will certainly help China to internationalize its multi-trillion-dollar domestic debt, thereby creating a huge market to turn the renminbi into an internationalization currency.
Whatever challenges China faces, its financial rise can no longer be ignored.
And Subramanian’s decade-old prediction remains valid: It will happen faster and more comprehensively than most observers expect.

A Global Strategy for Disaster Risk
SENDAI – Current disaster-risk levels are alarming.
The cost of damage to commercial and residential buildings worldwide is averaging $314 billion each year, with the private sector bearing as much as 85% of that price tag.
At the same time, a new United Nations report shows that annual investments in disaster-risk reduction of $6 billion can result in savings of up to $360 billion.
Hundreds of business executives, aware of the dramatic costs – and potential benefits – at stake, are now preparing to attend a UN conference on disaster-risk reduction in Sendai, Japan.
A decade ago, when the last such gathering was held, the private sector was scarcely represented.
This time, companies and entrepreneurs will be there in full force to explore a range of valuable opportunities.
The Tohoku region of Japan, where the meeting will take place, is a vivid reminder of how a disaster's economic impact reverberates far beyond its epicenter.
Devastated four years ago by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, Japan's automobile production was cut by nearly half.
The financial damage did not stop at the country's borders; as a direct result of the slowdown in Japan, automobile production dropped by some 20% in Thailand, 50% in China, and 70% in India.
The risks inherent in globalized production carry great rewards for those who know how to manage them properly.
That is why major businesses such as PricewaterHouseCoopers, Hindustan Construction Corporation, AbzeSolar, Swiss Re, AECOM, AXA Group, IBM, and others – spanning many sectors and encompassing all regions – are engaging with UN experts to improve global strategies for disaster-risk management and reduction.
This level of business engagement bodes well for pioneering a new planet-friendly and people-sensitive approach to global prosperity.
Indeed, the disaster-risk reduction conference in Sendai is the first in a series of major international gatherings this year.
Beyond Sendai, world leaders will convene in Addis Ababa in July to discuss financing for development, in New York in September to adopt a new development agenda, and in Paris in December to reach a meaningful climate-change agreement.
Taken together, these meetings promise to generate transformative action that can set the world on a safer, more prosperous, and more sustainable path.
Sustainability starts in Sendai for three major reasons.
First, by its very nature, disaster-risk reduction requires forward planning.
Second, investment in this area advances both sustainable development and climate action.
And, third, helping those who are most vulnerable to disasters is the ideal starting point for the effort to aid all people by establishing universal targets for development and climate change.
Over the last 12 months, thousands of lives were saved in India, the Philippines, and elsewhere by improved weather forecasting, early-warning systems, and evacuation plans.
Advances in risk reduction that safeguard development gains and business investments must match this progress in disaster preparedness, and we must make wise choices that create greater opportunities in the future.
For example, experts estimate that 60% of the land that will be urbanized by 2030 has not yet been developed.
Enterprises that factor disaster risk into their construction plans will avert the much higher costs of retrofitting later.
More broadly, over the next 15 years, the world will make major investments in urban infrastructure, energy, and agriculture.
If this spending is directed toward low-carbon goods, technologies, and services, we will be on our way to creating more resilient societies.
More and more industries appreciate this.
At the Climate Summit that I convened last September at the UN in New York, financial institutions, commercial and national banks, insurance companies, and pension funds vowed to mobilize more than $200 billion by the end of this year for action to address climate change.
They envisioned a host of new initiatives, including issuing so-called green bonds and shifting assets to clean-energy portfolios.
In a particularly important move, the insurance industry, representing $30 trillion in assets and investments, committed to creating a Climate Risk Investment Framework for industry-wide adoption by the end of the year.
It is time to stop addressing development and humanitarian emergencies separately.
Disaster-risk reduction lies at the nexus of development assistance, which seeks to advance better living conditions, and humanitarian aid, which begins after a disaster hits.
Starting our international calendar with the Sendai meeting on disaster-risk reduction sends a clear signal that the world is ready to integrate its strategies.
I have seen the human toll of disasters – from earthquakes in China and Haiti to floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh to Superstorm Sandy, which affected the Caribbean and North America, even inundating the lower floors of the UN facilities in New York.
When business, civil society, and government team up to help countries withstand disasters, they save lives, boost stability, and create opportunities that enable markets and people alike to flourish.
Sustainable profits.
Sustainable livelihoods.
Sustainable development.
It all starts in Sendai.

America’s False Narrative on China
NEW HAVEN – In a rare moment of bipartisan agreement, America’s Republicans and Democrats are now on the same page on one key issue: Blaming China for all that ails the United States.
China bashing has never had broader appeal.
This fixation on China as an existential threat to the cherished American Dream is having serious consequences. It has led to tit-for-tat tariffs, escalating security threats, warnings of a new cold war, and even whispers of a military clash between the rising power and the incumbent global hegemon.
With a trade deal apparently imminent, it’s tempting to conclude that all this will pass.
That may be wishful thinking.
Sino-American trust is now in tatters.
The likelihood of a superficial deal won’t change that.
A new era of mutual suspicion, tension, and conflict is a very real possibility.
But what if the US chattering class has it all wrong and the China bashing is more an outgrowth of domestic problems than a response to a genuine external threat?
In fact, there are strong grounds to believe that an insecure US – afflicted with macroeconomic imbalances of its own making and fearful of the consequences of its own retreat from global leadership – has embraced a false narrative on China.
Consider trade.
In 2018, the US had a $419 billion merchandise trade deficit with China, fully 48% of the massive overall trade gap of $879 billion.
This is the lightening rod in the debate, the culprit behind what US President Donald Trump calls the “carnage” of job losses and wage pressures.
But what Trump – and most other US politicians – won’t admit is that the US ran trade deficits with 102 countries in 2018.
This reflects a profound shortfall of domestic saving, owing in large part to the reckless budget deficits approved by none other than Congress and the president.
Nor is there any recognition of supply-chain distortions – arising from inputs made in other countries but assembled and shipped from China – that are estimated to overstate the US-China trade imbalance by as much as 35-40%.
Never mind basic macroeconomics and new efficiencies from global production platforms that benefit US consumers. Apparently, it is much easier to vilify China as the major obstacle to making America great again.
Next, consider intellectual property theft.
It is now accepted “truth” that China is stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of US intellectual property each year, driving a stake into the heart of America’s innovative prowess. According to the accepted source of this claim, the so-called IP Commission, in 2017 IP theft cost the US economy between $225 and $600 billion.
Leaving aside the ridiculously broad range of such an estimate, the figures rest on flimsy evidence derived from dubious “proxy modeling” that attempts to value stolen trade secrets via nefarious activities such as narcotics trafficking, corruption, occupational fraud, and illicit financial flows. The Chinese piece of this alleged theft comes from US Customs and Border Patrol data, which reported $1.35 billion in seizures of total counterfeit and pirated goods back in 2015.
Equally dubious models extrapolate this tiny sum into an aggregate guesstimate for the US and impute 87% of the total to China (52% to the mainland and 35% to Hong Kong).
Then there is the red herring emphasized in the Section 301 report published by the US Trade Representative (USTR) in March 2018, which provides the foundational justification for tariffs levied on China: forced technology transfer between US companies and their Chinese joint venture (JV) partners.
The key word is “forced,” which implies that innocent US companies that enter willingly into contractual agreements with Chinese counterparts are coerced into surrendering their proprietary technologies in order to do business in the country.
To be sure, JVs obviously entail a sharing of people, business strategies, operating platforms, and product designs.
But the charge is coercion, which is inseparable from the presumption that sophisticated US multinationals are dumb enough to turn over core proprietary technologies to their Chinese partners.
This is another shocking example of soft evidence for a hard allegation. Incredibly, the USTR actually admits in the Section 301 report (on page 19) that there is no hard evidence to confirm these “implicit practices.”
Like the IP Commission, the USTR relies instead on proxy surveys from trade organizations like the US-China Business Council, whose respondents complain of some discomfort with China’s treatment of their technology.
The Washington narrative also paints a picture of China as a centrally planned behemoth sitting astride massive stated-owned enterprises (SOEs) that enjoy preferential credits, unfair subsidies, and incentives tied to high-profile industrial policies such as Made in China 2025 and Artificial Intelligence 2030.
Never mind a large body of evidence that underscores the low-efficiency, low-return characteristics of China’s SOEs.
Nor is there any doubt that comparable industrial policies have long been practiced by Japan, Germany, France, and even the US.
In February, Trump issued an executive order announcing the establishment of an AI Initiative, complete with a framework to develop an AI action plan within 120 days.
China is hardly alone in elevating innovation to a national policy priority.
Finally, there is the time-worn issue of Chinese currency manipulation – the fear that China will deliberately depress the renminbi to gain unfair competitive advantage.
Yet its broad trade-weighted currency has risen over 50% in real terms since late 2004.
And China’s once-outsize current-account surplus has all but vanished.
Still, the currency grievances of yesteryear live on, getting prominent attention in the current negotiations.
This only compounds the false narrative.
All in all, Washington has been loose with facts, analysis, and conclusions, and the American public has been far too gullible in its acceptance of this false narrative.
The point is not to deny China’s role in promoting economic tensions with the US, but to stress the need for objectivity and honesty in assigning blame – especially with so much at stake in the current conflict.
Sadly, fixating on scapegoats is apparently much easier than taking a long, hard look in the mirror.

Russian Realities
At first glance, Russia bears many of the hallmarks of a great power.
It possesses a large arsenal of nuclear weapons, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, enormous reserves of oil and other minerals, a recent record of robust economic growth, and more territory than any other country despite being only three-fourths the size of the former Soviet Union.
Closer inspection, however, reveals a different Russia.
Much of its wealth reflects the increased value of energy, not productive economic activity.
Russia’s armed forces are able to project little in the way of usable military might.
The country’s population now numbers less than Pakistan’s and is declining by 500,000 people per year, leaving large portions of its vast landmass mostly uninhabited.
Male life expectancy is now less than 60 years, owing to alcoholism, crime, drugs, disease, and a dreadful public health system.
All this adds up to a Russia that, if not quite a Potemkin state, is anything but great.
There are limits to what Russia can accomplish in the world in any positive sense, although its capacity to be a spoiler or create problems is considerable.
Decisions made in Moscow can affect world energy prices, the future of the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, and the success of terrorists.
For better and for worse, Russia still matters.
But how much will it matter?
One question concerns political stability.
In order to remain intact and functional, the country needs a political system and a society that persuade talented young people to stay in Russia – and that provides them with the education to develop their talent. There also must be limits on the power of the central government and the presidency, a degree of regions autonomy, and rule of law – in short, the rudiments of a modern state and democracy.
Alas, Russia is moving more in the opposite direction; political power is becoming more, not less, concentrated.
The economic picture is similarly uncertain.
High energy prices are a boon to Russia’s economy, but, as is often the case in the Middle East and other oil- and gas-rich regions, they can be a burden as well, feeding corruption and discouraging real economic activity. The challenge for Russia’s leaders is to use its oil wealth to educate Russia’s people and rebuild Russia’s infrastructure, thereby ensuring global competitiveness and employment growth.
Russia also needs a national security strategy to complement its political and economic renewal.
All stick and little carrot has failed to quell Chechen nationalism, and President Vladimir Putin’s similarly heavy-handed attempts to control Russia’s so-called “near abroad” – as in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution – have proven no more successful.
Nor will any posture succeed that seeks to put Russia forward as a geopolitical counterweight to the United States.
Such a strategy might be politically satisfying to some, but Russia lacks the resources to compete with the US and needs good bilateral relations in order to proceed with its own internal transformation.
At the same time, the best way to help bring about a more liberal Russia – one that promises to be more stable at home and more responsible abroad – is by working with it.
The outside world can and should support the strengthening of civil society, independent media, and a true transfer of political power in 2008.
Isolating Russia makes no sense.
Russian membership in the World Trade Organization has the potential to strengthen the rule of law, combat corruption, and give Russia a stake in better relations with the outside world.
Closer ties between Russia and the European Union make sense for similar reasons.
There should also be some understanding for what Russia and the Russian people have gone through over the past two decades.
Losing a country and a special place in the world is the sort of trauma that could lead to the emergence of extreme and potentially violent nationalism.
Russia should be treated as a major power, which means consultations on important global issues.
Its voice should be heard on matters ranging from terrorism and weapons proliferation to global climate change and energy policy.
Next year’s G-8 meeting in Russia provides an opportunity to do all of this and more.
Amid all the attention being devoted to China and the potential for competition or even conflict with the US, it should not be forgotten that Russia’s future hangs in the balance, for history suggests that declining powers can pose as great a challenge to world order as rising ones.
One need only consider Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey at the start of the twentieth century or the former Yugoslavia at its end.
So far, the decline of what was the Soviet Union has proceeded relatively well; Russia, the principal successor state, has avoided all-out civil war and war with its neighbors.
But the challenge of integrating Russia remains.
At best, Russia is a potential partner in the effort to manage globalization’s challenges; at worst, it is a potential problem.
What is certain is that how Russia develops will be a key factor determining the character of this century, no less than the last.

No Velvet Transition
CAMBRIDGE: It is easy to idealize revolutions that happen somewhere else.
Across the West, people have been celebrating the tenth anniversary of the end of communism as the war won without firing a shot.
Across the former Soviet empire, genuine euphoria is tempered by ten hard years of change.
Some things happened as expected: Hungary is doing better than most, Estonia outpaced the rest of the Soviet Union, and Southern Europe is in trouble.
But surprises also abound.
Everybody's "basket case" of 1989, Poland, became the region's dynamo.
The Czech Republic – everyone's favorite – went from Velvet revolution to muddied reformer.
Russia has been the biggest puzzle.
It avoided the abyss that was widely predicted by the now unemployed Kremlinologists.
But Russia also refused to become "normal."
I myself thought that communism's collapse would deliver quicker social rejuvenation in Russia, although I argued from the start that Russia's road would be a hard slog, and that the country required substantial financial help from the West.
Despite the variety of transitions underway, there are some durable lessons that can probably be drawn by now from the experience of the postcommunist transitions:
• Markets work, but require a solid legal framework to function
Where the legal framework could be changed quickly, as in eliminating price controls and a myriad of subsidies, or assuring currency convertibility, market forces began to work quickly and efficiently.
Reforms unleashed the beneficial forces of supply and demand, as Poland's experience made dramatically evident, and brought an end to the endemic shortages of the old regime.
But when the new legal framework demanded the creation of working state institutions that took time to create, quick reforms often had less than the desired effect.
Speedy privatization, for example, especially the mass voucher schemes in Czechoslovakia, Russia, and many other former Soviet countries, did not work.
Transferring title from state to private hands did not create enough real ownership. What is worse, when privatization was rushed through, the result was massive corruption, managerial plunder, and paralysis at the firm level.
Although some abuses could have been lessened, the main reason for failure was that reform of the state did not keep pace with economic reforms.
• Initial conditions matter in economic restructuring
Some surprises of the postcommunist transition needn't have been such, if the different starting points had been properly considered.
Poland's chaos in the 1980s, for example, may have created the basis for rapid growth in the 1990s, because the dead hand of central planning had already been cut off when the reforms began.
Where central planning was alive, as in Czechoslovakia, it may have made it more difficult to break the mold of loss-making state enterprises. In largely agricultural China, huge state industrial enterprises had been less important, so their reform could have been postponed, and reliance could be placed on "starting afresh."
But in the more "advanced" socialist countries, such as Russia, where 90% of the population was employed in state-owned industries, restructuring the state sector – a much harder job in many ways – was a necessity, and an obstacle to quick recovery.
• Civil society is critical to successful transformation
Even when governments have good intentions, they tend to be corrupted, if power is unchecked.
Constitutions provide modest checks, but private associations of professionals, religions, and regions – the heart of civil society – provide the deeper balance.
Stalinist purges in Russia left no independent institutions to stop the depredations of corrupt officials, managers, and the state.
In Poland, by contrast, Communism never managed to destroy the Catholic Church or prevent the rise of the Solidarity movement.
(Stalin once complained that establishing party rule there was like putting a saddle on a cow.) Solidarity unionists, even if they often opposed many specific policy proposals, stopped firm managers from stealing assets; and the Church provided a force with which all governments to reckon.
• Geography is an important factor
It is fashionable today to stress the global nature of the world's problems.
But geography has not ceased to matter.
The closer a postcommunist country was to the European Union, the more successful and dynamic has been the transformation.
Countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, and the Baltic States, have done much better at attracting foreign investment, expanding exports, and stimulating economic growth than those whose markets were at a greater remove from the European Union.
Just as U.S. firms go next door to Mexico, German firms head for the immediate neighborhood to the East.
• History casts a long shadow
1989 was supposed to be a fresh start, the awakening from a nightmare.
But 1989 also awakened ancient antipathies and mythologies that had been repressed in the Communist era.
Who would have thought that in the late 20th century Serbian mythologies over the Battle of Kosovo of 1389 could galvanize a population behind the murderous nationalism of Slobodan Milosevic?
• Assistance from developed countries can make a big difference
Blame for failures does rest, in part, on the West, which was nonchalant in its efforts and stingy with its purse. Poland is the exception that suggests what might have been.
Here the West helped with initial balance of payments funds and later with debt cancellation.
Compare this with what happened in Russia, which was denied vitally needed funds and lasting debt relief.
Many American politicians and citizens felt that the U.S. had no business helping a former rival nation that still had more than 10,000 nuclear warheads.
What aid was given was a mere drop in the bucket when set against Russia's gargantuan financial and social needs. The final irony?
The IMF actually provided most of its funds, but after reformers had been thrown out of office and Russia's kleptocracy had revealed itself!
