Saudi Arabia’s Game of Thrones
PRINCETON – Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has just replaced the 57-year-old Muhammad bin Nayif with his 31-year-old son, Mohammed bin Salman, as crown prince, completing a process of power centralization that began with Salman’s accession to the throne in January 2015.
Prince Mohammed, commonly known as MBS in Western circles, is the king’s favorite son.
By appointing him as crown prince, Salman, who is now 81, has signaled a clear break from a decades-old tradition of building consensus among the leading sons of the Saudi state’s founder, the late King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.
In structural terms, Saudi Arabia is no longer a power-sharing gerontocracy.
It has returned to the absolute monarchy that it was under Ibn Saud himself.
Power is concentrated entirely in the hands of the king, who has delegated most of it to his son, the new crown prince.
In practical terms, MBS’s rise will streamline decision-making, and mitigate the political risks that are inherent in any system of multiple, competing power centers.
There is now absolute clarity on the questions of succession and where power lies.
But while this new arrangement certainly has its advantages, it also has potential pitfalls, because far-reaching decisions could go unquestioned and unchallenged.
When Salman dies, MBS will become king, and will most likely rule Saudi Arabia for many decades, leaving his imprint on the country’s social, religious, and economic life.
His rise to power – which started in 2009, when he became an adviser to his father, who was then governor of Riyadh Province – has been meteoric.
But being named crown prince is his most impressive achievement to date.
MBS has won a race to the throne that included hundreds of princes, most of whom are older and more experienced – and all of whom feel entitled to rule.
To be sure, the king’s favoritism clearly gave MBS a leg up; but that alone does not explain his success.
MBS had to rely on his wit, guile, and force of personality to consolidate power and assert his authority over key sectors of Saudi society.
These include the royal family itself; the bureaucracy and technocratic elites; the media and intelligentsia; the massive national oil company, Saudi Aramco; and the religious establishment and its various institutions.
Moreover, MBS managed all of this while still formally adhering to the Saudi royal family’s strict protocols and elaborate codes of hierarchy.
This helps to explain why the transition from one crown prince to another appeared to go so smoothly.
In a widely distributed video clip, MBS can be seen falling to his knees to kiss the just-dismissed incumbent crown prince’s hand.
But it is Nayif who formally offers his allegiance to MBS, leaving no doubt about where power lies.
MBS’s second great achievement has been in foreign policy, where he has been able to prove his capabilities to his father.
MBS took the initiative to reach out to US President Donald Trump and his team immediately after the US presidential election in November 2016, and his efforts paid off, culminating in Trump’s visit to Riyadh in May 2017.
Trump’s visit was a major victory for Saudi Arabia.
US-Saudi relations had reached a nadir during former US President Barack Obama’s tenure, but they have now been reset.
During his visit, Trump emphasized the importance of the US-Saudi strategic relationship, offered his full support in Saudi Arabia’s rivalry with Iran for regional primacy, and signed various business and investment deals worth many billions of dollars.
MBS, who is nothing if not ambitious, has set two broad goals for Saudi Arabia.
The first, which he outlines in a program called Vision 2030, is to diversify the Saudi economy, by reducing its heavy dependence on oil revenues, and creating good jobs outside of the oil sector.
MBS is convinced that Saudi Arabia’s vast oil reserves will be far less valuable in the future, owing to the rise of alternative fuels and renewable-energy technologies.
Under Vision 2030, MBS will try to monetize the upfront value of Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves as much as possible.
These proceeds will then be allocated to developing the country’s non-oil sectors, and invested in offshore assets to offset the inevitable loss in oil revenues.
To that end, MBS is keen on privatizing part of Saudi Aramco through an initial public offering in 2018.
MBS’s second major goal is to turn Saudi Arabia into a regional military hegemon that can stand up to external threats, not least Iran.
To do this, he will have to make his country far less dependent on US military protection, on which it has relied since 1945.
It will take a decade or more to accomplish each of the new crown prince’s goals.
But now that MBS’s power base is finally secure, he seems to have every intention of carrying them out.

America's Schizophrenic Economy
The news about America's economy that dribbled out over the first half of March painted - once again - a picture that only a schizophrenic could create.
Real investment (investment adjusted for the declining prices of high-tech and information-related capital goods) continued to roar ahead.
Production and sales were consistent with the consensus forecast of real GDP growth at an annual rate of 4% or more.
Yet, despite all this, employment remained stagnant: net job creation in the United States continues to stall.
This does not mean that employment in America cannot grow.
Roughly 300,000 more Americans are employed in education and health care than a year ago - an annual rate of employment growth of 1.7%.
A quarter of a million more Americans are employed in business and professional services than a year ago - a 1.6% annual rate of employment growth.
The logic of stagnant employment is not that adding jobs to the American economy is impossible, but that demand growth is insufficient to create more jobs than are lost.
This is easy to demonstrate.
Total nominal spending in America grows at 5.5% per year.
Inflation is 1.5% per year. And overall productivity growth is 3.5% per year.
So the equation is simple: 5.5%-1.5%-3.5% = 0.5%.
That 0.5% is all that is left for job growth, because that's all the job growth required to meet demand given the remarkably strong rate of growth of productivity.
Where America's productivity growth is coming from is clear.
A relatively small part of it is coming from simple speed-up: in an economy where the amount of time it takes for the unemployed to find new jobs is close to a post-WWII record high, demands for speeding-up the pace of work will be met with a "Yes, boss!" rather than a "Take this job and shove it!"
A bigger part of this increased productivity comes from the extraordinary technological revolutions in computers and communications that have led to dramatic increases in the usefulness - and decreases in the cost - of high-tech capital.
The boost to wealth provided by the "new economy" is exceeding even its most avid boosters' wildest dreams.
What is unexpected is that the new wealth is flowing not to the shareholders of dot-com companies, but to purchasers and users of high-tech capital and the consumers they serve.
But why does this seem so surprising?
At the end of the nineteenth century the huge amount of investment and technological progress in America's railroads appeared to benefit everyone but the stockholders and bondholders of railroad companies, as bust followed boom and ramming worthless securities down the throats of investors became Wall Street's favorite sport.
Yet another part of US productivity growth due to the fact that high-tech capital gives America's firms enormous incentives to make massive but hard to see - and even harder to measure - investments in organization and business processes that are complementary to computerization and networking.
For the US to have a rate of productivity growth of 3.5% per annum rather than the pre-1995 rate of 1.2% is amazing.
That means an annual increment to world income of $250 billion from this source alone.
That's the equivalent of adding productive power equal to a quarter of the economy of India - and adding it every year.
This persistent acceleration in American productivity growth has, however, created a massive political problem for President George W. Bush.
Demand growth at a pace that in any previous decade would have been seen as highly satisfactory is suddenly desperately insufficient, and Bush is being blamed (with some justice) for the slack labor market that has resulted.
But for everyone except Bush - and those left unemployed by the lag in demand - it is an extraordinary opportunity.
The remarkable boosts to productivity that have been within America's grasp will ultimately lead to accelerating growth of real profits and real wages, if only US policy makers resist the temptation to pursue politically expedient, but economically damaging, measures to "protect" output and employment.
As the world's leading-edge economy, America faces the hardest work in ensuring growth, for it must create - not only copy and adapt - new technologies, better forms of capital, and more productive business organizations.
If America can grow as fast as it is now, that is very good news for other, less-developed economies, especially since one powerful effect of ongoing technological revolutions in computers and communications is to make it much easier to participate in the global division of labor now centered in the US.
So the schizophrenic American economy is a sign that the world is entering an economic era of truly wonderful things - if only we properly, and patiently, grasp them.

What Should Economists Be Doing?
ITHACA – The unexpected financial crash of 2008, the persistence of the slowdown that occurred in its wake, the failure of conventional monetary and fiscal policies to revive economies, and the cracks in global trade that we are witnessing now have all given rise to a widespread disquiet about conventional economics.
As David Graeber wrote in a recent review of Robert Skidelsky’s new book Money and Government: The Past and Future of Economics, “There is a growing feeling … that the discipline of economics is no longer fit for purpose.”
Rather than offering a specific critique or solution, I want to draw attention to some foundational issues concerning the evaluation of economics.
What makes assessing the discipline so challenging is the very nature of the subject, which is a strange mixture of science and commonsense.
This is the reason for many policy mistakes by politicians – they take it to be all commonsense.
Another challenge arises from the fact that, unlike for most natural sciences, what economists say can affect what they study.
Consider the frequent complaint that no economist has been able to predict, say, stock market crashes or exchange-rate fluctuations.
Now, assume such an economist exists.
If she predicts a stock market crash next month, the crash will happen immediately, not next month, because people will sell their stocks right away.
Moreover, the sole reason for the immediate crash may well be that the economist predicted it.
An economist who is known to be able to forecast crashes with a lead time, and can demonstrate this ability, is a logical impossibility.
Nonetheless, we have to recognize that conventional economics, and the social sciences more generally, have not done well in helping us cope with our new world and its major issues: the digital revolution, volatile markets, sharp climatic changes, and the retreat of democracy.
There is no denying that serious empirical research has helped make economics the important discipline that it is today.
At the same time, it is now time to turn to economic theory.
Ailing economies and crumbling politics prompt big questions about the discipline’s foundations.
It is no surprise that the biggest breakthroughs in economic theory have occurred during times of great turmoil.
As I have written elsewhere, it was on the heels of the Industrial Revolution that the British economist Stanley Jevons had his seminal insight into how prices are formed and goods and services acquire value.
As he wrote to his brother in 1860, “I cannot now read other books on the subject without indignation.” This was the start of the marginalist revolution, soon to be followed by path-breaking contributions from Léon Walras and others.
The decade or so after the Great Depression marked another era of breakthroughs.
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow, reflecting on his high school years in the late 1930s, wrote that “It was an obvious fact of life to us that our society was malfunctioning politically and economically, and that nobody really knew how to explain it or what to do about it.” It is no coincidence that several seminal works were published around this time, such as John Maynard Keynes’ The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936) and John Hicks’ Value and Capital (1939).
We live in similar times: Solow’s quote is as relevant for today’s world as it was for the world in the 1930s.
The only difference is that our world is more globalized, so the malaise is not confined to the United States and a few other advanced economies, but extends to Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
Such times call for a paradigm shift in the science trying to grapple with the problem.
All science, including economics, is based on assumptions.
Many of these are written down explicitly, often as axioms.
In addition, however, all disciplines rely on assumptions that are so deeply engrained that even practitioners are not aware of them.
These are what may be called the “assumptions in the woodwork.”
You can see their presence even in everyday life.
When your dinner host asks if you eat everything and you say yes, you presume sticks and stones are not part of the discourse.
Occasionally, during cross-cultural encounters, you are jolted into awareness of these latent assumptions.
Euclidean geometry was developed by explicitly writing down a series of axioms.
What was not written down, but was central to the Euclidean paradigm, was the assumption of a flat, horizontal surface.
Hence, Euclidean geometry would not strictly apply to all worlds, including the spherical one that we inhabit.
The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler realized this in the eighteenth century, marking the start of a paradigm shift to non-Euclidean geometry.
(Of course, giving rise to a whole field named as not being one’s own is still a staggering achievement.)
Economics is now at a stage when we need to examine the assumptions in the woodwork that are hindering our ability to understand and map the new world of digital technology and inter-linkages that we are beginning to inhabit.
“Normal science” must continue, but it is also time to examine the theoretical foundations of the discipline.
We need to go beyond mere statistical regularities to understand, for example, how the world of money affects the supply of goods and services.
We need to investigate how economics influences our political choices, and how those choices that feed back to economics.
And we must recognize that economic behavior is shaped not only by prices and regulation but also by social norms that are woven into our psyche and influence our individual choices – and, through those choices, the wellbeing of our communities, countries, and the world.

Georgia Splits the Kremlin
MOSCOW – Dmitry Medvedev inherited the post of President of the Russian Federation from Vladimir Putin, and while Putin moved down the pecking order to become Prime Minister, speculation has abounded from the start of Medvedev’s presidency about an eventual split between Russia’s two highest leaders.
The first days of the conflict in Georgia crushed this hypothesis.
Indeed, Putin and Medvedev have worked in perfect tandem with respect to Georgia, cooperating and skillfully performing their different roles, with Putin cast in the lead role of the menacing god of a Russian reckoning, and Medvedev in the supporting role of a possible humanitarian peacemaker.
But the Georgia crisis revealed a new strategic force in the Kremlin that opposes both Putin and Medvedev.
We still cannot name its players, but we are aware of its interests and impact on events in the same way that astronomers discern a new but invisible planet by recording its impact on known and visible objects in space.
One indication that something new is affecting Russian policy is provided by those loyal Kremlin pundits who are known for their gift of unmistakably guessing their masters’ changing moods.
One after another, they have appeared on television and radio to denounce “provokers,” whom they dare not name, for “planning the incursion of Russian troops all the way to Tbilisi and the establishment there of a pro-Russian government.”
Another indirect indication of an ongoing struggle is the uncertain behavior of the Russian military in Georgia, which apparently is the result of contradictory orders from the Kremlin.
While the Russian army seems not to have engaged in any active measures since reaching its current positions, it pointedly remains within a half-hour of Tbilisi.
The line in the sand that President George W. Bush drew on the night of August 11, warning against Russian air strikes on Tbilisi’s airport and shortly thereafter sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to visit Tbilisi, provoked a split in the Kremlin. The split divides those who are and are not concerned about the fate of Russian elites’ vast personal holdings in the West.
I call these camps, respectively, Russia’s global and national kleptocrats.
Both sides firmly agree that there is nothing that the “weakened and cowardly West” can do to restrain Russia, a nuclear and petroleum superpower, beyond financial retribution against those Russian rulers with vast assets abroad.
But the national kleptocrats seem to believe that they can live without overseas assets, or without educating their children and maintaining residences in the West.
Instead, they are content to own properties in elite residential areas around Moscow and in Russia, such as Rublyovka, Valday, and Krasnaya Polyana.
Both Putin and Medvedev (and their television propagandists) currently reflect the views and goals of the global kleptocrats.
Neither leader wants to capture Tbilisi.
Putin, of course, would have been glad to see Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, his sworn enemy, put in a cage.
But other, more down to-earth considerations are more important to him.
That said, Putin is keeping his options open to join the national plutocrats, in case their position dramatically strengthens.
If he crosses over to their side, he could even become their leader and triumphantly return to the throne that he formally abandoned only recently.
While no one yet knows the national plutocrats’ names, I believe that they are new, influential players in or associated with the Kremlin, and that they have now become bold enough to challenge both Putin and Medvedev.
Russia’s military chiefs, for whom it is psychologically difficult to be ordered by politicians to abruptly end a large-scale and successful military operation, are their natural allies.
I cannot predict who will win this growing confrontation.
But even if the global kleptocrats sustain their more “moderate” position on Georgia, theirs could be a Pyrrhic victory.
Every day and every hour, by means of their own propaganda, these globally minded kleptocrats, are setting the path to power for the nationalists.
In order to justify their authoritarian rule and camouflage from the Russian public their massive theft of the country’s resources, the global kleptocrats have already convinced ordinary Russians that they are surrounded by ruthless enemies who are trying to dismember and destroy Russia.
Now it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to explain why their wives and children are buying palaces in the capitals of countries that are supposedly Russia’s sworn enemies.
By contrast, the national kleptocrats’ position is more consistent.
They are not constrained by huge assets in the hated West.
It would not be difficult for them to convince ordinary Russians, who have already been primed by today’s xenophobic propaganda, that Tbilisi, Sevastopol, Astana, and Tallinn belong to Russia and should be taken by force.
Putin once said that “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century was the fall of the Soviet Union.”
The national kleptocrats may soon start calling for its reversal, and they are in an increasingly strong position to do so.

Globalization and the United Nations
After the disastrous month of September, when terrorist attacks and retaliation contributed to storm clouds over the global economy, November demonstrated the resilience of globalization.
The global economic downturn has led most of the world to rally together, not only in the hunt for the terrorists, but in reinforcing global cooperation.
Several events in November give hope for a stronger international community, with consequent economic benefits.
First, more than 100 countries assembled in Marrakech, Morocco, to complete a unique UN agreement to limit global climate change.
These countries agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases in order to slow the process of global warming.
Yes, the US is not yet a party to the agreement - even though America is the world's biggest single contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
Yet the fact that the world could agree despite the absence of the US may prove promising.
No single country, even the largest economy in the world, can stop the cooperation of others.
Sometime soon, the US is likely to rejoin these international discussions.
Second, the world community welcomed China as a member of the World Trade Organization. For hundreds of years, China held itself aloof from the world economy.
Then, in the middle of the 19 th century, China suffered at the hands of European imperial powers, which gained technological and industrial superiority over China, using this to force trading concessions from the Ching Dynasty.
For more than a century after that, China was in turmoil. Only 20 years ago did China decide to rejoin the world trading system.
This month's entry of China into the WTO is a major step in that process.
China has now rejoined the world community as a cooperative, stable, and powerful sovereign nation, which will be one of the leading trading countries in the years ahead.
Third, more than 140 nations agreed in Doha, Qatar to launch a new round of trade negotiations.
After years of global protests about free trade, the world's nations chose trade over protectionism.
Importantly, developing countries achieved several breakthroughs in the new trade agenda.
Poor countries won concessions on access to essential medicines; and they pressed for, and received, promises that rich countries would address protectionist policies in several areas.
Fourth, the war in Afghanistan has not only proceeded rapidly on the ground, but has led to a diplomatic breakthrough as well.
The UN will play a central role in the reconstruction of a working government in that country, and in coordinating humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people.
The growing role of the UN in this process puts the seal of international law and diplomacy over the global struggle against terrorism, and helps to reassure many countries that this is a true international effort, not just the US acting alone.
While these seem to be a grab-bag of achievements, they point to a single message: the world community is finding new ways to cooperate, even against a backdrop of terrorism and global recession.
The growing role of international institutions under the UN umbrella provides greater confidence that disputes can be addressed peacefully and even sensibly, with significant inputs of scientific expertise as in the Climate Change treaty.
No country wants to be outside of this global process.
China's membership in the WTO is sure to be followed by Russia's membership in the coming years.
Academic scholars and political observers debate whether globalization is a real phenomenon or a slogan; whether globalization is beneficial or harmful; and whether globalization is a fragile process that could be reversed or a robust process likely to gather force in the coming years.
My view is that globalization is a powerful and generally positive force.
It offers countries the gains from increased international trade, faster diffusion of technologies to mutual benefit, and hopes for less cross-country violence and conflict.
The agreements in November suggest that most of the world shares such hopes, and is ready to commit political resources into the success of the process.
Of course globalization requires international governance and rules.
It cannot be a game of rich against poor.
It cannot function without international law and international institutions.
Therefore the preeminence of UN institutions in so many events in November is notable.
The UN has shown its value in global environmental management, international trade, state building and reconstruction, and humanitarian assistance.
UN agencies will have a critical role to play in future years in helping Africa's impoverished countries (and those elsewhere) to derive larger benefits from globalization.
This month, in short, has been a fitting prelude to the happy occasion on December 13 th when UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the United Nations organization itself share this year's Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway.
The prize is a fitting measure of the role that the UN now plays and must continue to play in promoting a successful and peaceful globalization.

How to Protect Journalists from Online Harassment
NEW YORK – France is one of the few countries that have introduced laws that address cyberharassment, including that aimed at journalists.
Others would do well to emulate it.
Online harassment of journalists is a growing problem, with harassers often targeting those who write about trolls, white-supremacist groups, and other nasty patches of the web’s underbelly.
And women journalists are the most vulnerable – particularly when they cover supposedly “male” topics such as sports, says Sarah Guinee, who researched online harassment as a Patti Birch fellow for gender and media freedom at the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.
Generally, journalism associations and defenders of free expression tend to agree with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that in a “marketplace of ideas,” all ideas should be on the table, and the best ones will win out.
In other words, we should fight bad information and ideas with better information and ideas.
But the online behavior addressed by France’s legislation goes well beyond normal exchange of information and ideas.
For starters, the sheer quantity of hostility creates a crowding-out effect, so that much online speech that should be heard cannot be.
Moreover, online abusers often use different tactics than those used offline.
Digital harassment can include doxing (publishing someone’s home address or other personal information online), pile-ons (where many people attack one person), dissemination of disturbing images, revenge porn, impersonation, and cyberstalking.
In many countries, journalists facing harassment are told simply to ignore it, or to report on their harassers.
But the latter takes time and energy, and can lead to a backlash.
True, journalists such as Gustavo Gorriti in Peru, and Anton Harber and Thandeka Gqubele in South Africa, have sued for defamation following online abuse.
More often, however, media representatives targeted by online harassment censor themselves.
When the marketplace of ideas is not functioning properly – as is currently the case online – regulation is needed.
The issue vexing policymakers is whether existing legislation will suffice to address online harassment.
In a 2019 report, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Press Institute concluded that journalists should have recourse to targeted cyberlaws that provide for “swift, low-cost, low-burden remedies” in the event of online attacks.
France has been ahead of other countries on this front.
In 2014, French law defined online harassment for the first time; until then, such cases had been processed in the same way as those involving offline harassment.
And a 2018 law against sexual and sexist violence closed most loopholes regarding cyberharassment by broadening its legal definition.
As a result, French law now protects all citizens, including journalists, from doxing, defamation, insult, and online and offline harassment.
Although France’s Constitutional Council recently ruled against the law, it left intact the part that created a specialized prosecutor focused on online crimes, including online harassment.
The impact of France’s legislation transcends the country’s borders, because the new laws make it easier for journalists and other individuals to sue in Europe for cyberharassment.
More generally, Europe takes a broader view of what kind of speech can be punished than the United States does, and defends individual privacy rights more robustly.
Because attacks on a person’s reputation or credibility can be litigated in Europe, journalists there have more protection in that regard than their counterparts in the US and other parts of the world.
The case of Lyon-based journalist Julie Hainaut shows how France’s cyberharassment law can be used against harassers.
Hainaut was doxed and harassed online after reporting that the owners of “The First Plantation,” a colonial-themed bar that opened in the city in 2017, had spoken approvingly about the colonial era.
After she filed four separate complaints in two years, the French government finally prosecuted the case.
In late 2019, one of Hainaut’s harassers was convicted and given a six-month suspended jail sentence and a fine totaling €7,000 ($8,000).
(The harasser has appealed the verdict.)
“The legal system on defamation and harassment is quite cleverly built, as it preserves free speech and ensures journalists can fight back against trolls and harassers,” Paul Coppin, legal director for the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders, recently told me. “However, we still need sensitivity training for police and magistrates, as many seem not to fully grasp the impact of online harassment on victims and are not prepared to process complaints as quickly and seriously as they should.”
Big technology companies are both unwilling and unable fully to address the cyberharassment problem by themselves.
France’s appointment of a special prosecutor for online crimes reflects a recognition of this fact.
By following France’s example and introducing new laws, policymakers elsewhere also could help journalists and other at-risk groups to fight back against online abuse.

Challenging Europe’s Last Autocrat

The Paracetamol Dilemma
WELLINGTON – Paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the United States) is one of the world’s most commonly used drugs.
It is the preferred medication for relieving fever and pain because of its safety profile. However, 10 years ago, a hypothesis was proposed that the use of paracetamol may increase the risk of developing asthma. It was suggested that a change from the use of aspirin to paracetamol among children in the US during the 1980’s may have contributed to the increasing prevalence of childhood asthma noted during this period.
Substitution of paracetamol for aspirin, researchers proposed, may have led to an enhanced allergic immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to asthma and other allergic disorders.
Since then, a number of epidemiological studies have reported an association between asthma and exposure to paracetamol in the womb, in childhood, and in adulthood.
These studies led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol may represent an important risk factor in the development of asthma.
The latest evidence to support this hypothesis comes from a large international epidemiological study of childhood asthma that was recently published in the medical journal The Lancet .
This analysis, from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), involved more than 200,000 six- and seven-year-old children from 73 centers in 31 countries.
The children’s parents or guardians completed written questionnaires about current symptoms of asthma, rhinitis (hayfever), and eczema, and about several risk factors, including use of paracetamol for fever in the child’s first year of life and frequency of paracetamol use in the past 12 months.
The study identified that the reported use of paracetamol for fever in the first year of life was associated with symptoms of asthma in the six- and seven-year-old children.
The association was present in all major regions of the world, with an estimated 46% increased risk following adjustment for other risk factors.
A dose-dependent association between asthma symptoms at 6-7 years and paracetamol use in the previous 12 months was also observed.
Similar associations were observed between the use of paracetamol and the risk of severe asthma symptoms.
The proportion of asthma cases that could be attributed to exposure to paracetamol was calculated to be between 22% and 38%.
Paracetamol use both in the first year of life and in children aged 6-7 was also associated with an increased risk of symptoms of rhinitis and eczema.
This suggests that the potential effect of paracetamol is not restricted to the airways and may affect a number of organ systems.
Identifying the potential mechanisms that might underlie the association between paracetamol and asthma (and other allergic disorders) was not a part of this study.
But other researchers have proposed a number of plausible mechanisms, primarily related to paracetamol’s negative effect on the body’s ability to withstand oxidant stress and its potential enhancement of the allergic immune response.
The authors emphasised that causality could not be established from a retrospective study of this design due to the numerous potential biases that may confound the association. For example, it is known that viral respiratory tract infections in infancy such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are associated with an increased risk of asthma in later childhood and that paracetamol use for such episodes could have caused confounding in the study.
The study has contributed to the debate as to whether it is beneficial to treat fever in children, an issue comprehensively reviewed by Fiona Russell and colleagues in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization.
They propose that the available scientific evidence suggests that fever is a universal, ancient, and usually beneficial response to infection, and that its suppression under most circumstances has few if any demonstrable benefits.
On the contrary, they suggest that suppressing fever may occasionally produce harmful effects, and conclude that widespread use of drugs to reduce fever should not be encouraged.
They recommend that in children their use should be restricted to situations of high fever, obvious discomfort, or conditions known to be painful.
What is agreed is the need for randomized controlled trials of the long-term effects of repeated use of paracetamol in children.
Only then will it be possible to develop evidence-based guidelines for its recommended use.
Pending the results of such research, paracetamol remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in childhood, to be used in accordance with WHO guidelines, which recommend that it should be reserved for children with a high fever (38.5Co or above).
The use of aspirin in young children is contraindicated, owing to the risk of Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious complication.
Paracetamol also remains the preferred drug to relieve pain or fever in children or adults with asthma, because aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provoke attacks of asthma in susceptible people with this condition.

Islam’s Democratic Imperative
Mahmoud Abbas’s election in Palestine and the forthcoming vote in Iraq on January 30 have pushed the question of Islam’s compatibility with democracy to the center of the world’s agenda.
Sheik Dia al-Shakarchi, a leading Shi’ite theologian, argues that democracy is not only compatible with Islam, but is essential to it.
During the last 25 years, Islam has played an increasingly influential role in politics, and not only in the Islamic world, with political Islam frequently expressing itself in radicalism and terror.
Both Muslims and non-Muslims have not always agreed on the extent to which this is compatible with genuine Islam.
How Islam is understood varies widely among devout, moderately religious, and non-observant Muslims, as well as among Islamic scholars, political parties, and organizations.
Even western experts and critics of Islam hold different views.
Overall, there are two conflicting images of Islam: a peaceful Islam, which is ready for dialogue and coexistence, and a fundamentalist Islam, which is militant and even terrorist.
There is a widespread misperception that Islam’s holy texts are written in a way that can justify both interpretations.
But, in my opinion, the reason for different – and frequently contradictory – interpretations is an incompetent and incomplete approach that detaches individual texts from their context and construes them without a thorough understanding of the true spirit of the Koran.
This approach to Islamic texts – coming from both secular and religiously oriented Muslims, as well as from non-Muslims with an interest in the subject – calls into question the compatibility of Islam and democracy, and also whether Islam is capable with peace and moderation.
But, based on more than a decade of study and debate, I am convinced of the compatibility between Islam and democracy.
Indeed, in my view, democracy is not only permitted by Islam, but can be regarded as a religious rule.
My understanding is drawn from a principle contained by the basic Islamic theory of legal reasoning, which asserts that when strong religious interests can be realized only through a particular path of action, that path itself is no longer a matter of choice.
It also becomes a religious rule.
Thus, if we can establish that democracy is the means to realize the strong interests of the Muslim community – and I believe we can do this – then democracy may be declared a religious duty in Islam.
Even if democracy might be viewed primarily as an evil from an Islamic point of view, there is another principle of interpretation of religious laws in Islam, according to which minor evils – even if religiously impermissible or not recommended at first – become permissible, recommended, and even mandatory if they alone can prevent major evils.
The Muslim interest in democracy is best understood through a clear perception of the reality of how Muslims live.
A country like Iraq, for example, is home to a diverse and varied population: Arab and Kurd, Sunni and Shi’ite, not to mention minorities of other religions and ethnic groups.
Moreover, not all Muslims practice Islam, nor do those who practice do so in the same way.
So religion cannot be imposed; individuals must practice it according to their own decisions.
Any enforcement of religious practice only creates hostility toward religion.
Thus, I believe that a political system that best serves free choice – including the choice of people to be practicing Muslims – is the best system for Islam.
Of course, the problem of Islam’s compatibility with democracy may be analyzed from different points of view.
One possible approach is purely practical, comparing democracy with all other conceivable alternatives.
In my opinion, there are only five conceivable alternatives in a Muslim country.
The first is secular dictatorship.
This is unacceptable for two reasons.
First, dictatorship itself is ugly and unacceptable; second, secular dictatorship excludes Islamic parties from participating normally in the political system.
We have considerable experience of this in the Middle East.
Of course, an Islamic dictatorship is also possible.
But this, too, is unacceptable.
As with a secular dictatorship, Islamic dictatorship is ugly and destructive.
Such a dictatorship would damage Islam by associating Islam with unjust rule and creating enemies for Islam.
A third alternative is democracy, but with secular restrictions on religious parties.
In fact, this would be a pseudo-democracy, and would infringe on the rights of religious people to full participation.
Likewise, an Islamic democracy with restrictions on non-religious parties would be a mockery of democracy and harmful to Islam.
This would also be unrealistic, because in the current age of globalization, any claims to democracy would be exposed as obviously false.
So, in my view, true democracy is the only alternative, because it is realistic and promotes peace.
Call this ideology-free democracy: a political system that tolerates restrictions imposed only from within, never from outside, the democratic process itself.
We must recognize that democracy has proved its worth around the world.
It is the best way of organizing a society based on reality and not ideals.
Why shouldn’t Iraqis benefit from the proven experience of other peoples?

The New Philosophers
PRINCETON – At the recent meeting of G-20 finance ministers in Australia, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew noted “philosophical differences with some of our friends in Europe,” before urging Europeans to do more to boost their anemic growth rate.
The terminology is striking, and underscores the difficulty of Europe’s search for a way out of its current malaise.
Canada’s finance minister, Joe Oliver, joined the call for fiscal expansion in Europe – a position for which there seems to be some support within the European Central Bank.
Indeed, ECB President Mario Draghi has advocated higher spending by more fiscally strong countries like Germany.
And ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, together with his former colleague Jörg Asmussen, currently Germany’s deputy labor minister, recently suggested that Germany should “use its available room for maneuver to promote investments and reduce the tax burden of workers.”
In fact, most of the world believes that Germany should adopt a more expansive fiscal policy.
According to this view, austerity is counter-productive, because it induces slowdowns and recessions that make long-term fiscal consolidation more difficult.
But Germans – as well as some other Northern Europeans, and perhaps some Chinese economists – remain reticent.
They believe that responding to calls for stimulus would simply lead to more such calls, creating a log-rolling, pork-barrel dynamic in which any hope for fiscal consolidation is ruled out.
The stimulus-versus-austerity debate is an old one.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the United States regularly called on Germany and Japan to act as locomotives for the global economy.
But, until recently, the divergences were viewed in terms of interests, not “philosophies.”
Americans wanted additional demand for their goods and higher prices, while the Germans and Japanese defended their export industries.
The problem today, as Lew’s recent statement highlighted, stems from deeply entrenched differences between the opposing sides’ belief systems, with ideological questions about fairness and responsibility trumping pragmatic discussion of the best way forward for everyone.
As the historian Robert Kagan argued in 2002, Americans and Europeans do not only have different worldviews; they occupy entirely different worlds.
Philosophical differences are extremely difficult to reconcile.
Just as Platonists and Aristotelians struggled against one another for millennia, Kantians and utilitarians have been at one another’s throats for centuries.
Such deep theoretical conflicts have real-world consequences, as they impede constructive debate and cooperative action in crisis situations.
Fundamental ideological divisions over the 2003 Iraq war have strained global politics for more than a decade.
Modern political processes and structures are simply not well suited for conducting – much less settling – philosophical disputes.
Democratic institutions are designed for making deals between competing interests, with parliaments specializing in finding the right combination of concessions to enable agreement on a generally accepted solution.
Likewise, international forums like the G-20 exist precisely to persuade a large number of vastly different countries to set aside philosophical questions for the sake of their shared economic, political, or security interests.
Philosophies do not just give a little here and there, blurring over the difficult bits in the hope that everything will work out in the end.
Imagine asking a Kantian to add just a bit of utilitarian calculation to the categorical imperative.
Of course, resolving a philosophical debate is not impossible.
It was standard pre-modern practice to overcome such differences with a formal disputation.
In the early sixteenth century, the German princes attempted to settle the philosophical challenge presented by Protestant reformers by engaging Martin Luther to debate a prominent orthodox Catholic theologian, Johannes Eck.
There are not that many modern varieties of this sort of practice, but the 1944 United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods comes close.
By systemically engaging with the economic issues involved in building a viable international system, experts created a new global economic and political order.
In a sense, central banks have begun to resemble medieval philosophical faculties, with discussions addressing the issues underlying policy decisions, rather than just the policies themselves.
In the ECB, for example, a debate is underway to determine under which conditions deviation from fiscal orthodoxy might be stabilizing in the long term.
How that debate is resolved could lead to a new kind of international cooperation.
At a time when political processes are stalled on both sides of the Atlantic, the US Federal Reserve and the ECB have been engaging in a series of policy innovations, feeling their way toward a solution that could promote and sustain economic recovery.
On this basis, the ECB is recasting itself as the incubator of a new intellectual and philosophical synthesis.
But central banks’ new role as supreme arbiters of policy truth is fraught with hazard.
Given that the solutions that emerge from their disputations and analyses will be the product of technocratic – not democratic – processes, they are likely to trigger populist backlashes.
Moreover, the policy approaches that central banks produce may be too complex and interlinked to function efficiently.
In particular, the attempt to make expansionary policies conditional on the implementation of a host of microeconomic reforms is problematic.
If only some parts of a complex package linking fiscal leeway with structural reform are realized, the outcome is likely to disappoint – or even prove counterproductive.
When it does, the old philosophical divisions are likely to resurface.

That Old Time Anti-Vaxx Feeling
BRUSSELS – Vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19, and the evidence for that is overwhelming.
While protection against infection or transmission is not guaranteed – especially with the Delta variant raging – getting vaccinated substantially reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from the coronavirus.
Widespread vaccination is thus the key to enabling responsible governments to relax public-health restrictions, thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue.
But this seems increasingly to be out of reach.
Researchers estimate that 70-85% of the population needs to be vaccinated (or otherwise immune to COVID-19) to end the pandemic.
Yet even in Israel, which was leading the world in its vaccination drive at the beginning of 2021, the share of the population that has been vaccinated has stalled at just over 60%.
In the United States, only about half the population is now protected, and vaccination rates have plummeted from 3.2 million doses per day in April to fewer than 700,000 doses per day as of early August.
The US case is particularly interesting, because the country-wide average obscures large differences among socio-economic groups and across states.
Whereas over 63% of people in Massachusetts and Maine are fully vaccinated, only 34% of people in Mississippi and Alabama are.
Across towns and counties, the disparities are even larger.
This is less a problem of access than of acceptance.
It has been widely observed that, at least in the US, the willingness to be vaccinated is correlated with political affiliation. Polls show that only around 54% of Republican adults have been vaccinated, compared to 86% of Democrats.
In counties that voted for Donald Trump, a Republican, in the 2020 presidential election, vaccination rates are more than ten percentage points lower than in counties that voted for Joe Biden, a Democrat.
But while the statistical link between political affiliation and vaccine hesitancy is strong, correlation does not equal causation.
Moreover, anti-vaccine sentiment is nothing new: the NoVax movement existed long before the COVID-19 pandemic.
The question, then, is whether people are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine merely because of their political beliefs, or whether those political beliefs and their stance on the vaccine reflect other, deeper factors.
A look at people’s broader attitudes toward science and trust in the establishment (scientific and otherwise) could help us to find the answer.
One useful indicator here is the acceptance of evolution.
Surveys have found repeatedly that a substantial minority of Americans reject the scientific consensus that humans are the product of a long process of natural selection.
Belief in evolution is strongly linked to acceptance of vaccination.
Indeed, the best single predictor of vaccine uptake per US state is the share of the population that believes the human race has always existed.
Interestingly, religious beliefs do not seem to be decisive here. The link between vaccine uptake and the prevalence of the belief that divine intervention steered evolution is rather weak.
Furthermore, political partisanship, as measured by voting patterns in the 2020 presidential election, loses its predictive power over vaccine uptake after one accounts for belief in evolution.
The implication is that attitudes toward vaccination are rooted not in party allegiance, but in a latent mistrust of science.
This may reflect how democracy works more broadly.
As Christopher H. Achen and Larry M. Bartels argue in their 2017 book, Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government, it is not that political parties present their programs, and rational voters choose which to support; instead, parties represent existing identity groups.
In the US, the Republican Party has positioned itself so that it captures the segment of Americans who do not accept science if its results collide with their worldview.
This type of person does not believe in evolution (roughly one-quarter of the population, on average) and tends to reject COVID-19 vaccines.
But the GOP is not necessarily responsible for those stances.
So, contrary to Jeffrey Frankel’s recent assertion, America’s Republicans probably cannot be said to be “killing their voters.”
In a sense, this is bad news.
If people’s decision not to get vaccinated is based on fundamental beliefs, it will be much more difficult to change than if it was based on political partisanship or health concerns.
Disseminating more factual information – more studies, more statistics – will not make a difference.
After all, evolution has been taught in schools for generations.
Financial incentives, like lotteries, might sway some of the doubters.
But a substantial community of hardcore anti-vaxxers is likely to remain – and not only in the US.
Compulsory vaccination elsewhere, such as in France, is also being met with strong resistance.
As the Delta variant fuels new COVID-19 outbreaks, governments in countries with a strong anti-vaxx movement have few good options left.

How Climate Policies Hurt the Poor
NEW YORK – Over the past 25 years, nearly 1.2 billion people around the world have been lifted out of poverty, while both malnutrition and the risk of death from air pollution have decreased.
Taken together, these achievements are nothing short of a miracle.
But two global trends now threaten to slow the momentum in reducing poverty.
The first is nationalist opposition to free trade.
Rising protectionism is imperiling economic growth – including in the world’s poorest countries, which would benefit most from a more open global trading system.
Concluding the long-stalled Doha Round of global trade talks, for example, could make the world $11 trillion richer each year by 2030 and lift 145 million more people out of poverty.
Free trade has costs, and governments should spend more to support vulnerable populations in rich countries.
Yet these costs are massively outweighed by the benefits to consumers and producers.
Opposition to free trade thus runs counter to the economic evidence.
But there is another, arguably greater threat to progress on reducing poverty: governments’ blinkered pursuit of hugely expensive climate-mitigation policies.
The German government, for example, plans to spend €40 billion ($44 billion) over four years to help the country cut its carbon dioxide emissions.
Such measures will likely reduce the global rise in temperature by 0.00018°C in a hundred years – an immeasurably small gain for such a huge cost.
By contrast, spending the same amount on preventing tuberculosis in developing countries could save more than ten million lives.
Similarly, New Zealand’s government has promised to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050.
But a government-commissioned report found that the cost of meeting this goal would be greater than the entire current national budget, every single year – and that’s a best-case scenario that assumes policies are implemented as efficiently as possible.
Likewise, Mexico’s pledge to halve its emissions by 2050 will likely cost 7-15% of GDP.
And the European Union’s plan to reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050 could entail average annual costs of at least $1.4 trillion.
Globally, the 2015 Paris climate agreement is the most expensive international accord in history, because it aims to wean entire economies off fossil fuels, even though alternative energy sources such as solar and wind remain uncompetitive in many contexts.
As a result, the agreement will slow economic growth, increase poverty, and exacerbate inequality.
A new study suggests that the massive cost of reducing emissions under the Paris agreement will lead to an increase in poverty of around 4%.
And the authors issue a stark warning that “stringent mitigation plans may slow down poverty reduction in developing countries.”
This finding is consistent with other studies of the effects of climate policies on poverty, including the vast research project undertaken for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that maps five alternative global futures.
That study shows that humanity – including the world’s poorest people – will be much better off in a “fossil-fueled development” scenario than under a “sustainable” scenario of a lower-CO₂ world.
And this still holds true even after accounting for climate damage.
While global inequality will decrease dramatically in both scenarios, it will decline slightly fasterin the “fossil fuel” scenario.
In fact, the “sustainable” world would have an average of 26 million more people per year in poverty until 2050 than the richer and less unequal fossil-fueled world.
Polarizing campaigns about climate change have created an absurdly distorted view of the future, leading policymakers to make poor decisions.
In its most recent major report, the IPCC estimated that if the world does absolutely nothing to stop climate change, the impact will likely be equivalent to a 0.2-2% reduction in average incomes in the 2070s.
And by then, incomes will likely have risen by some 300-500%.
Yet catastrophic visions of climate change abound.
As a result, about one-third of all development spending now goes to climate projects, according to an OECD analysis of about 70% of global development aid.
This money could be far better spent – not only on preventing tuberculosis, but also on immunization, infant nutrition, improved access to family planning, and many other development priorities.
Moreover, policies that reduce poverty are climate policies.
History has shown conclusively that making people richer and less vulnerable is one of the best ways to strengthen societies’ resilience to challenges such as climate threats.
When natural disasters like hurricanes hit a poor community or country, they kill many people and cause havoc.
But cutting CO₂ emissions in the rich world is not the best way to help.
The first priority should be for policymakers to promote development so that people no longer live under corrugated roofs in abject poverty.
That will not only improve people’s quality of life; it will also dramatically reduce the human cost of future hurricanes.
We must tackle climate change effectively, efficiently, and at the appropriate scale.
The most sustainable policy would be a dramatic increase in research and development spending to drive the cost of green energy below that of fossil fuels through innovation.
As matters stand, however, the world is in great danger of spending scarce resources on climate policies that hurt rather than help its poorest people.
Governments should instead focus on growth-enhancing measures such as trade liberalization that provide a pathway to increased welfare and greater equality.

Storm Clouds over the Euro
The creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) was an unprecedented achievement, promising deeper and larger markets.
The stimulus to trade and investment is manifest.
But will the Euro last?
Two current developments will shape the answer.
The first is the outcome of battles raging in France, Germany, and elsewhere over social security reform. The second is the debate over the inclusion of ``social rights'' in the EU's draft Constitution.
Welfare state entitlements are vastly different from country to country in Europe. These differences portend intense conflicts within EMU.
France, Germany, and Italy must scale back their social commitments, raise taxes, or borrow.
But in the Eurozone's increasingly competitive environment, raising taxes would drive away business, while cutting benefits may be tantamount to political suicide.
So the temptation to borrow is high.
The Stability and Growth Pact is designed to block that temptation by keeping budget deficits below 3% of GDP.
But the Pact is already straining, and today's serial violations may appear mild when the baby boom generation begins to retire and public pension and health liabilities become cash demands.
Some national deficits may rise to twice the Pact's limit.
If that happens, the affected countries can expect no help from the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from bailing out member states.
Italy and Belgium, heavily indebted when the Euro was launched, could become the classic victims of a vicious circle, in which high deficits trigger rising interest rates, higher borrowing costs, even higher deficits, and eventually default.
If an EMU country defaults, it will come under intense pressure to leave the Euro in order to regain control of its currency and pay at least its domestic liabilities in devalued national paper.
If that country is large, the shock waves could push other members over the edge with it.
Recent events in Argentina provide a warning as to how such a crisis can unfold.
Ballooning provincial deficits, which Argentina's central government could not control--but was obliged to finance--pushed the country into default, forcing it to abandon a monetary pact (the currency's one-to-one peg to the dollar) to which the population was attached.
The Euro faces a second basic challenge.
The governments that launched EMU anticipated that their workers and businesses would eventually be sufficiently mobile and flexible to adjust to economic changes affecting them differentially.
At present, workers throughout the EU resist moving to change jobs, and social regulations hamper the mobility and adaptability of businesses.
Legislatures are under pressure to relax these constraints.
But little noticed social provisions in the EU draft Constitution, which Europe's leaders are expected to sign in less than a year, could compromise the liberalizing process.
In Part II of the draft Constitution, a list of ``social rights'' is incorporated as ``constitutional rights,'' enforced by the European Court of Justice.
These include protection against ``unjustified dismissal,'' the right to ``working conditions that respect the worker's health, safety and dignity,'' and ``entitlement to social security benefits [apparently regardless of cost] ... in cases such as illness, old age, and loss of employment.''
Faced with these new statutes, the Court might well change its basic approach.
Since its inception, the Court's thrust has been to enforce the economic freedoms mandated by successive agreements since the Treaty of Rome.
A Bill of Social Rights will require the Court to balance this liberalizing mission with attention to the new protections.
In this new legal environment, national efforts to dismantle business restrictions could grind to a halt.
The consequences for the Euro would be grave.
Without further liberalization, EMU will remain subject to potentially fatal strains arising from shocks that affect some countries more than others.
Imagine that the economic boom that Greece is experiencing in the run-up to the 2004 Olympics turns to bust after the games end.
Because the drachma does not exist anymore, it cannot be devalued.
If the ECB considers a large reduction of interest rates, contrary to its inflation objectives, the bank won't be able to help by cutting interest rates to benefit Greece.
So the appropriate response for Greece would be an energetic restructuring program, involving closing some businesses, requiring changes in working conditions, and perhaps even cutting wages.
But if regulations block Greek firms from laying off workers, and if militant Greek unions refuse any changes in working conditions, the result could be a wave of bankruptcies and a surge in unemployment.
The Greek government, already burdened by social security obligations, would have to increase unemployment payments, at a time when its revenues would be collapsing.
Radical proposals to leave the Euro, and restart the Greek economy with a program of devaluation and budgetary expansion, could become compelling.
In truth, many of the rigidities underlying this hypothetical crisis are not attributable to provisions in the draft Constitution.
Greece has not liberalized sufficiently to insure its economy against idiosyncratic shocks, despite impressive reforms to date.
A new Bill of Social Rights would not create destructive rigidities, but it could slow down the liberalizing process that countries like Greece need to withstand the vicissitudes of a common currency.
A Euro crisis can be avoided.
But to do so the nations of Europe must lift the twin clouds of pension debt and regulatory protections.
France and Germany are pursuing modest but nonetheless courageous reforms. If their liberalizing efforts, and those of others, are not to stall, their leaders should see to it that the draft Bill of Social Rights is not frozen in its present form in the EU Constitution.
Instead, these rights should be left in the hands of national legislatures, which have the flexibility to change their minds.

Biden’s Asian Triangle
CAMBRIDGE – How Joe Biden handles China will be one of the defining issues of his presidency.
He inherits a Sino-American relationship that is at its lowest point in 50 years.
Some people blame this on his predecessor, Donald Trump.
But Trump merits blame for pouring gasoline on a fire. It was China’s leaders who lit and kindled the flames.
Over the past decade, Chinese leaders abandoned Deng Xiaoping’s moderate policy of “Hide your strength, bide your time.”
They became more assertive in many ways; building and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea, intruding into waters near Japan and Taiwan, launching incursions into India along the countries’ Himalayan border, and coercing Australia economically when it dared to criticize China.
On trade, China tilted the playing field by subsidizing state-owned enterprises and forcing foreign companies to transfer intellectual property to Chinese partners.
Trump responded clumsily with tariffs on allies as well as on China, but he had strong bipartisan support when he excluded companies like Huawei, whose plans to build 5G networks posed a security threat.
At the same time, however, the United States and China remain interdependent, both economically and on ecological issues that transcend the bilateral relationship.
The US cannot decouple its economy completely from China without enormous costs.
During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union had almost no economic or other interdependence.
In contrast, US-China trade amounts to some $500 billion annually, and the two sides engage in extensive exchanges of students and visitors.
Even more important, China has learned to harness the power of markets to authoritarian control in ways the Soviets never mastered, and China is more countries’ trading partner than the US is.
Given China’s population size and rapid economic growth, some pessimists believe that shaping Chinese behavior is impossible.
But this is not true if one thinks in terms of alliances. The combined wealth of the developed democracies – the US, Japan, and Europe – far exceeds that of China.
This reinforces the importance of the Japan-US alliance for the stability and prosperity of East Asia and the world economy.
At the end of the Cold War, many on both sides considered the alliance a relic of the past; in fact, it is vital for the future.
US administrations once hoped that China would become a “responsible stakeholder” in the international order.
But President Xi Jinping has led his country in a more confrontational direction.
A generation ago, the US supported China’s membership in the World Trade Organization, but there was little reciprocity; on the contrary, China tilted the playing field.
Critics in the US often accuse Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush of naiveté in thinking that a policy of engagement could accommodate China.
But history is not that simple.
Clinton’s China policy did offer engagement, but it also hedged that bet by reaffirming its security relationship with Japan as the key to managing China’s geopolitical rise.
There were three major powers in East Asia, and if the US remained aligned with Japan (now the world’s third-largest national economy), the two countries could shape the environment in which China’s power grew.
Moreover, if China tried to push the US beyond the first island chain as part of a military strategy to expel it from the region, Japan, which constitutes the most important part of that chain, remained willing to contribute generous host-country support for the 50,000 US troops based there.
Today, Kurt Campbell, a thoughtful and skilled implementer of Clinton’s policy, is the key coordinator for the Indo-Pacific on Biden’s National Security Council.
The alliance with Japan enjoys strong support in the US.
Since 2000, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and I have issued a series of bipartisan reports on the strategic relationship.
In our fifth report, released on December 7, 2020 by the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, we argue that Japan, like many other Asian countries, does not want to be dominated by China.
It is now taking a leading role in the alliance: setting the regional agenda, championing free-trade agreements and multilateral cooperation, and implementing new strategies to shape a regional order.
Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spearheaded a reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan’s post-war constitution, to strengthen the country’s defense capabilities under the United Nations Charter, and, after Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he preserved the regional trade pact as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for TPP.
Abe also led quadrilateral consultations with India and Australia regarding stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Fortunately, this regional leadership is likely to continue under Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who was Abe’s chief cabinet secretary and is likely to continue his policies.
Common interests and shared democratic values continue to form the bedrock of the alliance with America, and public opinion polls in Japan show that trust in the US has never been higher.
It is not surprising that one of Biden’s first calls to foreign leaders after his inauguration was to Suga, to assure him of America’s continued commitment to strategic partnership with Japan.
The Japan-US alliance remains popular in both countries, which need each other more than ever.
Together, they can balance China’s power and cooperate with China in areas like climate change, biodiversity, and pandemics, as well as on working toward a rules-based international economic order.
For these reasons, as the Biden administration develops its strategy to cope with China’s continued rise, the alliance with Japan will remain a top priority.

Was the Stock-Market Boom Predictable?
NEW HAVEN – Should we have known in March 2009 that the United States’ S&P 500 stock index would quadruple in value in the next ten years, or that Japan’s Nikkei 225 would triple, followed closely by Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index?
The conventional wisdom is that it is never possible to “time the market.”
But moves as big as these, it might seem, must have been at least partly foreseeable.
The problem is that no one can prove why a boom happened, even after the fact, let alone show how it could have been predicted.
The US boom since 2009 is a case in point.
In looking at the US stock market, it is important to bear in mind that its participants are overwhelmingly US investors.
According to a US government study published last year, despite some growth between 2009 and 2017, the share of the US stock market owned by foreigners was still only about one-seventh in 2017.
But if all people heeded financial advisers’ counsel and were completely diversified, people outside the US, who held more than two-thirds of the world’s wealth as of last year, would own over two-thirds of the US stock market as well.
Home-country bias, or patriotism, is a big factor in the stock market.
So, to understand the US stock market’s strength, we need to consider the thinking of its participants.
There seems to have been an overreaction in the US to a temporary drop in earnings.
S&P 500 earnings per share had been negative (a very rare event) in the fourth quarter of 2008, both for “reported earnings” and for “operating earnings,” and those numbers were just coming in around March 2009, when the index reached its nadir.
You might think that an intelligent observer in the US in 2009 would have recognized that the decline was temporary, and would have expected earnings – which are relevant to forecasting long-term growth of stock prices – to recover.
But the real question is whether the observer could have based a very optimistic forecast for long-term earnings growth on the rebound from that negative earnings moment.
We now know that long-term measures of earnings growth did not change a lot.
Ten-year average S&P 500 earnings per share from 2009 to 2019 were up only 71% from the previous decade.
The quadrupling in the S&P 500 price index was thus driven not by higher earnings but by much higher valuations of earnings.
It is true that real interest rates are down since 2009, with the ten-year US Treasury Inflation-Protected Security yielding 0.8% in February, down from 1.71% in March 2009.
But all of that decline occurred by 2010 and could not justify any of the strong uptrend in stock prices since then.
In 2009, some people in the US were using very strong language to express their fear.
One heard that a “financial supernova” was coming.
A ProQuest News & Newspapers search for “derivatives” and “financial weapons of mass destruction” (a phrase attributed to Warren Buffett) shows that these two terms first appeared together in 2003 and gained intense popularity by 2009, only to fade to near nothing by 2018.
Those who were prescient enough to know that derivatives markets weren’t going to blow up the economy might have known that any drag on the market from the fear that they would could not be sustained for ten years.
But a forecast based on such prescience is hard to quantify or defend publicly.
The fact that economists on the whole had not predicted the 2008 financial crisis was much emphasized at the time and led to some lost faith.
Many people were worrying in March 2009 that stocks had a lot further to fall.
Under my direction, the Yale School of Management has been collecting data on the opinions of both institutional and individual investors in the US since 1989.
One of the questions is: What do you think is the probability of a catastrophic US stock-market crash, like that of October 28, 1929 or October 19, 1987, in the next six months, including a crash caused by financial contagion from other countries?
In early 2009, the percentage of people who gave a probability greater than 10% reached a record high (since 1994).
Likewise, ProQuest News & Newspapers counts of the frequency of the phrase “Great Depression” soared to unprecedented heights.
There were more mentions of “Great Depression” in 2009 than there were during the Great Depression.
But then, with no stock-market crash and no extreme depression in sight, these fears were replaced by their opposite: deeper admiration of business success.
A new narrative emerged, featuring a new wave of billionaire geniuses whose appearance in the 1990s was interrupted only briefly by the financial crisis.
The publication in 2011 of the number-one best seller Steve Jobs,Walter Isaacson’s biography of the Apple founder, is one example.
Elon Musk has stirred excitement with futuristic companies such as aerospace manufacturer SpaceX and Neuralink, which is developing implantable brain-computer interfaces.
The accession of a flamboyant businessman, Donald Trump, to the US presidency is evidence of the strength of many Americans’ identification with business heroes.
Starting in 2004, Trump spent much of his time developing his business persona as the star of the reality TV show The Apprentice, and then, from 2008, The Celebrity Apprentice.
His campaign marshaled this enthusiasm, and his claim that he would “Make America Great Again” appealed to the optimism of US investors.
The quadrupling of US stock prices since 2009, as well as Trump’s election, thus appears to reflect, at least in part, a process of fear abatement and re-enchantment with American business culture.
But it is hard to forecast such trends – even the biggest – in the stock market, not only because forecasting is a highly competitive business, but also because spontaneity plays such an important role in human behavior.

Asian Values RIP
NEW YORK – Few politicians have garnered as many effusive public tributes after their death as Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founder and long-serving former prime minister.
A man who was treated as a sage by Henry Kissinger, regarded as a political role model by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and described as “a true giant of history” by President Barack Obama must have done something right.
One thing is indisputable: Lee’s influence was many times greater than his actual political authority, which, to his evident chagrin when Singapore and Malaysia split in 1965, never stretched beyond the narrow borders of a small city-state in Southeast Asia.
Lee’s most profound influence has been in post-Mao China, where booming economic enterprise coexists with an authoritarian Leninist one-party state.
Lee was the pioneer of capitalism with an iron fist.
His People’s Action Party, though far less brutal than the Chinese Communist Party, has ruled over a de facto one-party state.
Like many authoritarian leaders (Mussolini, for one), Lee was once a socialist.
But his thinking was influenced just as much by oddly nostalgic memories of British colonial discipline and a somewhat self-serving take on Confucianism, stressing obedience to authority, while disregarding the equally Confucian right to dissent.
Singapore’s humming economy, material comfort, and smooth efficiency seem to confirm the view of many that authoritarianism works better than democracy, at least in some parts of the world.
No wonder, then, that Lee was so much admired by autocrats everywhere who dream of combining their monopoly on power with the creation of great wealth.
Yet there is something extraordinary about the adulation of Lee.
Other leaders who held similar views were not treated as great sages, let alone as giants of history.
The Chilean military strongman Augusto Pinochet, for example, imposed his own version of capitalism with an iron fist, and, though Margaret Thatcher and Friedrich von Hayek admired him, hardly anyone reveres him today.
Why Lee, and not Pinochet?
For starters, Lee did not come to power in a military coup, and his opponents were not massacred in football stadiums.
Dissidents in Singapore were often locked up and maltreated, but no one was tortured to death.
Lee’s government, while still allowing elections as a token of democratic rule, preferred to crush opposition through intimidation and financial punishment: brave men and women who stood up to him were bankrupted in ruinously expensive lawsuits; Lee could generally rely on a compliant judiciary.
But Lee’s stellar reputation has to do with culture, too.
He was very good at playing to that ancient Western stereotype of the Wise Man from the East.
Even though “Harry” Lee, as he was known when he was a student at Cambridge, imbibed much from Western civilization, including a peculiar admiration for the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, he was always careful to stress the Asian provenance of his political ideas.
Lee never claimed that liberal democracy in the West was a mistake.
All he said was that it was not suitable for “Asians.”
His argument was that Asians were used to putting the collective good above individual interests.
Asians were naturally obedient to higher authority.
These traits were rooted in Asian history: they were deep “Asian values.”
There are good reasons to doubt this thesis.
First of all, who are these “Asians”?
Most Indians would surely disagree that they are culturally unsuited to democracy – as would modern Japanese, Taiwanese, or South Koreans.
It makes a certain sense to speak of Asian values in Singapore, because it would be disrespectful to the Malay and Indian minorities to justify their subservience by invoking Chinese values.
But there are plenty of Chinese as well, not just in Taiwan and Hong Kong, who would take issue with Lee’s cultural defense of authoritarianism.
Even Singaporeans are beginning to get a little restless.
Is it true at least to say that more democracy would have made Singapore a less efficient, prosperous, and peaceful society?
Many Singaporeans might believe so.
But whether they are right is by no means certain, because the question was never put to the test.
South Korea and Taiwan went through democratic transformations in the 1980s, following the end of their versions of authoritarian capitalism, and are thriving more than ever.
Democracy certainly did the Japanese economy no harm.
Lee’s premise, from which he never departed, was that, especially in a multi-ethnic society like Singapore, a meritocratic elite must impose social harmony from above.
In this sense, he was indeed rather Chinese.
By richly awarding the elite, Lee minimized the scope for corruption.
It is to his credit that he made this work in Singapore, though at some cost.
Singapore may be efficient, and relatively free of corruption; but it is also a rather sterile place, with little room for intellectual or artistic achievement.
What might work for a time in a small city-state can hardly be a useful model for larger, more complex societies.
China’s attempt at capitalism with an iron fist has created a system of gross corruption, with huge disparities in wealth.
And Putin has to resort to ever more belligerent nationalism to cover up the social and economic deficiencies of his rule.
So, by all means, let us admire the smooth highways, towering office blocks, and spotless shopping malls of Singapore.
But, when assessing Lee’s legacy, we should also heed the words of Kim Dae-jung, who was jailed and almost killed for opposing South Korea’s dictatorship, before becoming the country’s democratically elected president in 1998.
“Asia should lose no time in firmly establishing democracy and strengthening human rights,” he wrote in response to Lee.
“The biggest obstacle is not its cultural heritage, but the resistance of authoritarian rulers and their apologists.”

Asia's Dysfunctional Democracies.
Asia has been gripped by election fever all year.
The Philippines and Taiwan have chosen new presidents; India and Malaysia have ushered in new parliaments and prime ministers.
September brings two more vital polls: a legislative election in Hong Kong and a presidential election in Indonesia.
Voters there may also extend a disturbing paradox that has emerged in the region: the more "vigorous" Asian democracy becomes, the more dysfunctional it is.
The attempt by opposition parties to impeach South Korea's President Roh Moo Hyun on the flimsiest of excuses; Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian's inability to pass legislation through a parliament controlled by the opposition Kuomintang; Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's stalemated first term and the logjam over the fiscal reforms needed to prevent a predicted Argentine-style meltdown early in her second: each bears testimony to democratic paralysis in Asia.
If deadlock and confusion were the only results, such political impasses might be tolerable. But chronic stalemate has confronted many Asian democracies with the threat of being discredited, a potential for violence, and the prospect of economic decline.
Indeed, the precedents of democratic immobility in Asia are hardly encouraging.
For example, since Pakistan's creation in 1947, partisan divisions have ensured that no elected government has been able to serve its full term.
So Pakistanis have grimly accepted military rule as their destiny.
The problem in Asia often arises from something the French call "cohabitation" - an awkward arrangement by which a directly elected president must co-exist with a parliament controlled by a rival party or parties.
The United States and Europe's mature democracies may function well enough with the "checks and balances" of divided government (though the Republicans' bid to impeach President Clinton a few years ago might suggest otherwise), but in Asia the failure to bestow executive and legislative powers on a single institution is usually a terrible drawback.
This seems especially true when a government tries to enact radical economic or political reforms.
The elected president wants to act, but the assembly refuses to approve the necessary laws. Or vice versa.
The pattern begins in parliamentary deadlock.
Incompetent leaders blame legislatures for their failures; legislators blame presidents from rival parties.
Finger pointing replaces responsibility, fueling popular demand for a strongman (or woman) who can override political divisions.
Indira Gandhi's brief "emergency rule" in the 1970's was partly the result of such institutional dysfunction.
Divided government also plays into the hands of Asia's separatists.
At a critical moment for Sri Lanka's peace process, President Kumaratunga was so incensed by the policies of her political rival, Prime Minister Wickremessinghe, that she sacked three of his ministers and called elections almost four years early.
The only people who seem to have benefited from this democratic division are the murderous Tamil Tigers.
Similarly, in Nepal, a Maoist insurgency has taken advantage of divisions between the King and parliament to gain control of much of the countryside.
True, Asian democracies, however unstable, are preferable to autocracies, whether military, as in Pakistan and Burma, or communist, as in China and Vietnam.
But the danger in a weakened democracy is not merely blocked legislation and ineffective government.
Ambitious but thwarted presidents are easily tempted to take unconstitutional measures; after all, they reason, the people elected them directly.
The same is true of some prime ministers, like Thailand's authoritarian Thaksin Shinawatra, who now stands accused of weakening his country's democratic traditions in favor of personal rule.
Given these precedents and the widespread instability exposed by this year's elections, perhaps Asian policymakers should consider the merits of doing away with "cohabitation" and adopting systems where electoral victory translates into real power.
Of course, parliamentary political systems are far from perfect.
Neither Singapore nor Malaysia, where ruling parties have long dominated the parliaments, has a political culture as healthy as in Taiwan or South Korea.
But in parliamentary democracies such as Japan and India, an elected leader runs the country until the day his or her party or coalition loses its legislative majority.
This means that governments are judged not by their ability to outmaneuver legislatures, but by the quality of their policies.
This seems to be a more efficient - and politically more stable - form of democracy than the unhappy cohabitation that produces such ugly confrontations in Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines.
By contrast, the threats posed by divided government could be greater than mere parliamentary rumbles.
Cohabitation could very soon become a problem even in the quasi-democracy of Hong Kong, if voters there on September 12 elect a legislature hostile to Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's Beijing-anointed chief executive, later this month.
Indonesia also risks deadlock if, as seems likely, the election on September 20 produces a president from a different party than the one that controls parliament.
Abraham Lincoln was right: a house divided against itself cannot stand.
In many Asian democracies, only institutional reconstruction will prevent a collapse.

Where Is the AMR Rebellion?
LONDON – The threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is being overshadowed by the menace of climate change.
Though the AMR problem is arguably equal in importance, it has not commanded nearly the same level of public awareness.
One reason for this is obvious: the climate crisis is becoming an increasingly visible phenomenon.
We Brits are no longer alone in obsessing about the weather.
From staggering heat waves in Europe and droughts in South Africa and Asia to wildfires in Brazil, Indonesia, California, and the outskirts of Sydney, the effects of climate change are evident everywhere.
And these constant images have created a groundswell of public opinion.
Helped along by climate activists like Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion, business leaders and policymakers are now more focused on climate change than ever before.
But what about AMR, and specifically the growing resistance to standard antibiotics?
Media outlets around the world still regularly cite the two big takeaways from the independent Review on Antimicrobial Resistance that I led in 2014-2016.
If we don’t reduce our dependency on unnecessary antibiotics and succeed in developing new ones (or alternatives such as vaccines), annual deaths stemming from AMR could reach ten million by 2050.
And on the economic front, the total costs of this failure (from 2015 to 2050) could top $100 trillion.
I have not conducted the same level of analysis for climate change.
The costs in human lives and lost output if we fail to address that problem could turn out to be larger, smaller, or around the same as those associated with AMR.
But whatever they are, I have believed for years that combating climate change is common sense from a strict risk-management perspective.
And now that public awareness about it is growing, so, too, are the opportunities for new wealth-enhancing investments in green forms of energy, production, and consumption.
In fact, large-scale investment in alternative foods, renewable energy, and low-carbon transportation systems may be just what we need to jumpstart economies that have been struggling since the 2008 crisis.
Aside from climate change, there is another parallel to the AMR crisis: the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016.
Policymakers and civil-society organizations from around the world responded to the epidemic quickly and effectively, chiefly because it was a top news story for days even in Western countries.
Americans were consumed by (irrational) fears of catching Ebola, and thousands of Westerners canceled overseas travel while demanding that policymakers do something.
In the event, the outbreak took fewer than 12,000 lives in the countries most affected by it.
That is a horrific figure, to be sure.
But it is actually lower than the death toll from AMR in Europe during the same period.
As our Review noted, AMR was taking 25,000 lives per year in Europe (with similar figures for the United States) as of 2016.
And now, the same sources we cited are reporting an annual toll of 33,000, which suggests that the incidence of AMR-related complications and deaths is rising faster than we projected.
Moreover, at $53 billion, the estimated cost of the Ebola outbreak exceeded the amount needed to fund the AMR Review’s 29 recommended interventions.
We estimated that $42 billion invested over the course of a decade would be necessary to avert the 2050 nightmare scenario outlined above.
And yet, aside from public statements by governments and multilateral organizations, little is being done about this existential threat to human wellbeing.
Where is AMR’s Greta?
To be sure, there does appear to have been a reduction in the use of antibiotics in agriculture in some Western countries, owing to new regulations and growing consumer demand for antibiotics-free products.
And China and India have both banned the use of colistin – a critical last-line antibiotic for humans – in agricultural feedstocks.
Nonetheless, we are quickly running out of antibiotics with which to treat AMR infections, and pharmaceutical companies are avoiding this area of development, owing to its financial risks and lack of a guaranteed payoff.
Yet, more broadly, investors and corporate boards are increasingly considering how they can make their portfolios and business models more socially responsible, not least by divesting from fossil fuels.
Such discussions are most welcome.
But when are we going to see a similar push for divestments from pharmaceutical companies that refuse to support the development of new antibiotics, or from countries that are not investing in measures to prevent the rapidly rising incidence of AMR?
Given the lack of action on this issue, it is time to start pushing for countries to list AMR as a cause of death on public death certificates.
And, for its part, the International Monetary Fund needs to start analyzing national health systems in its country-level assessments, as it is already doing with respect to climate-change preparedness.
The global groundswell for climate action now has the force of what we in finance would call a momentum trade.
AMR, meanwhile, seems stuck in what we would call a value trap.
But it won’t stay there forever.
One way or another, it will make itself known.

The Transatlantic Subsidies Race We Need
BRUSSELS – The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has America’s trading partners in a tizzy.
The legislation is not only gargantuan, dedicating some $369 billion to climate and clean-energy programs; it also has a “buy American” component, delivering cash benefits only to buyers of North American automakers and subsidies to renewable-energy producers that satisfy domestic-content rules.
Many countries, particularly in Europe, are now weighing the possibility of implementing their own green industrial policies.
This is the wrong response.
The IRA’s subsidies for American-made products are undoubtedly contentious, particularly among leading US trading partners such as Japan, South Korea, and the European Union.
US President Joe Biden is now in damage-control mode, as he attempts both to reassure partners and to find ways to soften the impact on allies by bending the IRA’s buy-American provisions.
European policymakers are unconvinced.
They fear that, unless they introduce subsidies of their own, the IRA will effectively guarantee US leadership in green industries.
But the logic underpinning this conclusion is dubious, at best.
True, some European firms have threatened to leave for the US if they do not receive similar subsidies at home.
But European producers of, say, wind turbines are unlikely to stop producing in Europe just because they expect business to boom in the US.
“Buy American” does not mean 100% American.
To secure the 10% domestic-content “bonus” – which the IRA offers on top of generous subsidies that do not depend on meeting the threshold – a company, such as a wind farm, must use only American steel, but only 40% US-manufactured components.
In other words, even with the added incentive to use American-made components, the US government expects that firms will rely mostly on imports.
Moreover, according to trade lawyers, “US-made” components could consist largely of imported sub-components, rendering the domestic-content provisions even less stringent in practice.
So, while the IRA does give firms an incentive to produce certain components in the US, there will still be plenty of demand for European products, not only in the US, but also, increasingly, in Europe.
In any case, the IRA is hardly an exemplar of good industrial policy.
On the contrary, some of its key provisions encourage waste.
In fact, Europe has already rejected the use of inefficient and costly fixed-rate renewable-energy subsidies – which account for $250 billion of the IRA’s total funding.
Instead, most European countries use auctions to find out what subsidy rate is needed to spur emissions reductions.
Some are also employing “contracts for difference,” under which the government pays investors the difference between the market price and a guaranteed minimum.
Another questionable feature of the IRA is the investment tax credit, which subsidizes 30% of the cost of a renewable-power plant (or 40%, if the domestic-content rules are fulfilled).
This is not economically efficient, as the subsidy is not linked to the amount of power that is ultimately produced.
There is also a kind of moral-hazard risk: with investors covering only 60-70% of the total cost, they might not put as much effort into reducing costs, or just increase their profits.
And waste in the construction of renewable plants would also lead to more emissions, especially if more energy-intensive goods like steel or concrete are used.
Finally, the IRA does little to spur green technological progress.
Any project that produces zero-emissions electric power qualifies for IRA support.
This means that wind farms and photovoltaic installations – for which costs continue to fall – are likely to be key recipients of IRA subsidies.
But while these technologies will be vital to reaching near-term emissions-reduction goals – say, for 2030 or 2035 – a net-zero future will require new technological and engineering breakthroughs.
That is what governments should be subsidizing.
Rather than offering inefficient subsidies to existing technologies, governments should be funding research and development for new ones.
Yet, for the EU, this presents a formidable challenge.
As it stands, most R&D spending in Europe occurs at the country – not EU – level, with funds being directed largely toward national universities and research labs.
Moreover, EU budget allocations are decided every seven years, and can be changed only by unanimous agreement.
As a result, it would be practically impossible for the EU to allocate more funding to R&D until 2027.
But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has an alternative proposal: transform the EU’s temporary pandemic borrowing program, NextGenerationEU, into a permanent resource.
Unfortunately, this scheme has little chance of being implemented, so she has also proposed loosening EU rules on state aid, in order to give member states more leeway to field national subsidies – an inferior option.
The poorly conceived, though much-vaunted, European Chips Act follows much the same pattern, giving EU member states more room for national subsidies, without providing much in the way of additional R&D funding.
The US CHIPS and Science Act, which allocates $13 billion to the development of the R&D workforce, is a much better model, both than the European version and the IRA.
The EU should not enter a subsidy race with the US, certainly not based on the IRA model.
A “green-tech” race – in which both sides support R&D for new green technologies – is a much better approach.
The question is whether Europe has the political will and vision needed to get into competition shape.

The Economic Fundamentals of 2013
NEW YORK – The global economy this year will exhibit some similarities with the conditions that prevailed in 2012.
No surprise there: we face another year in which global growth will average about 3%, but with a multi-speed recovery – a sub-par, below-trend annual rate of 1% in the advanced economies, and close-to-trend rates of 5% in emerging markets.
But there will be some important differences as well.
Painful deleveraging – less spending and more saving to reduce debt and leverage – remains ongoing in most advanced economies, which implies slow economic growth.
But fiscal austerity will envelop most advanced economies this year, rather than just the eurozone periphery and the United Kingdom.
Indeed, austerity is spreading to the core of the eurozone, the United States, and other advanced economies (with the exception of Japan).
Given synchronized fiscal retrenchment in most advanced economies, another year of mediocre growth could give way to outright contraction in some countries.
With growth anemic in most advanced economies, the rally in risky assets that began in the second half of 2012 has not been driven by improved fundamentals, but rather by fresh rounds of unconventional monetary policy.
Most major advanced economies’ central banks – the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank – have engaged in some form of quantitative easing, and they are now likely to be joined by the Bank of Japan, which is being pushed toward more unconventional policies by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government.
Moreover, several risks lie ahead.
First, America’s mini-deal on taxes has not steered it fully away from the fiscal cliff.
Sooner or later, another ugly fight will take place on the debt ceiling, the delayed sequester of spending, and a congressional “continuing spending resolution” (an agreement to allow the government to continue functioning in the absence of an appropriations law).
Markets may become spooked by another fiscal cliffhanger.
And even the current mini-deal implies a significant amount of drag – about 1.4% of GDP – on an economy that has grown at barely a 2% rate over the last few quarters.
Second, while the ECB’s actions have reduced tail risks in the eurozone – a Greek exit and/or loss of market access for Italy and Spain – the monetary union’s fundamental problems have not been resolved.
Together with political uncertainty, they will re-emerge with full force in the second half of the year.
After all, stagnation and outright recession – exacerbated by front-loaded fiscal austerity, a strong euro, and an ongoing credit crunch – remain Europe’s norm.
As a result, large – and potentially unsustainable – stocks of private and public debt remain.
Moreover, given aging populations and low productivity growth, potential output is likely to be eroded in the absence of more aggressive structural reforms to boost competitiveness, leaving the private sector no reason to finance chronic current-account deficits.
Third, China has had to rely on another round of monetary, fiscal, and credit stimulus to prop up an unbalanced and unsustainable growth model based on excessive exports and fixed investment, high saving, and low consumption.
By the second half of the year, the investment bust in real estate, infrastructure, and industrial capacity will accelerate.
And, because the country’s new leadership – which is conservative, gradualist, and consensus-driven – is unlikely to speed up implementation of reforms needed to increase household income and reduce precautionary saving, consumption as a share of GDP will not rise fast enough to compensate.
So the risk of a hard landing will rise by the end of this year.
Fourth, many emerging markets – including the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), but also many others – are now experiencing decelerating growth.
Their “state capitalism” – a large role for state-owned companies; an even larger role for state-owned banks; resource nationalism; import-substitution industrialization; and financial protectionism and controls on foreign direct investment – is the heart of the problem.
Whether they will embrace reforms aimed at boosting the private sector’s role in economic growth remains to be seen.
Finally, serious geopolitical risks loom large.
The entire greater Middle East – from the Maghreb to Afghanistan and Pakistan – is socially, economically, and politically unstable.
Indeed, the Arab Spring is turning into an Arab Winter.
While an outright military conflict between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other side remains unlikely, it is clear that negotiations and sanctions will not induce Iran’s leaders to abandon efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
With Israel refusing to accept a nuclear-armed Iran, and its patience wearing thin, the drums of actual war will beat harder.
The fear premium in oil markets may significantly rise and increase oil prices by 20%, leading to negative growth effects in the US, Europe, Japan, China, India and all other advanced economies and emerging markets that are net oil importers.
While the chance of a perfect storm – with all of these risks materializing in their most virulent form – is low, any one of them alone would be enough to stall the global economy and tip it into recession.
And while they may not all emerge in the most extreme way, each is or will be appearing in some form.
As 2013 begins, the downside risks to the global economy are gathering force.

Big Lies about Central Banking
An independent central bank focused exclusively on price stability has become a central part of the mantra of "economic reform."
Like so many other policy maxims, it has been repeated often enough that it has come to be believed.
But bold assertions, even from central bankers, are no substitute for research and analysis.
Research suggests that if central banks focus on inflation, they do a better job at controlling inflation.
But controlling inflation is not an end in itself: it is merely a means of achieving faster, more stable growth, with lower unemployment.
These are the real variables that matter, and there is little evidence that independent central banks focusing exclusively on price stability do better in these crucial respects.
George Akerlof, who shared the Nobel Prize with me in 2001, and his colleagues have argued forcefully that there is an optimal rate of inflation, greater than zero.
So ruthless pursuit of price stability actually harms economic growth and well being.
Recent research even questions whether targeting price stability reduces the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.
A focus on inflation may make sense for countries with long histories of inflation, but not for others, like Japan.
America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, is mandated not only to ensure price stability, but also to promote growth and full employment.
There is broad consensus in the US against a narrow mandate, such as that of the European Central Bank.
Today, Europe's growth languishes, because the ECB is constrained by its single-minded focus on inflation from promoting economic recovery.
Technocrats and financial market players who benefit from this institutional arrangement have done an impressive job of convincing many countries of its virtues, and of the need to treat monetary policy as a technical matter that should be put above politics.
That might be the case if all that central bankers did was, say, choose computer software for clearing payments.
But central banks make decisions that affect every aspect of society, including rates of economic growth and unemployment.
Because there are tradeoffs, these decisions can only be made as part of a political process.
Some argue that in the long run there are no tradeoffs.
But, as Keynes said, in the long run, we are all dead.
Even if it were impossible to lower unemployment below some critical level without fuelling inflation, there is uncertainty about what that critical level is.
Accordingly, risk is unavoidable: monetary policy that is too loose risks inflation; if it is too tight, it can cause unnecessary unemployment, with all the suffering that follows.
During America's growth boom in the 1990s, the Clinton Administration believed that it was worth risking pushing the unemployment rate lower, especially when the social gains--declining welfare roles, reduced violence--were added to the direct economic benefits.
By contrast, the IMF urged tighter monetary policy, because it put far less weight on the cost of unemployment, seemingly no weight on the ancillary social benefits of reducing it, and much greater weight on the costs of potential inflation.
The economic analysis of Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers turned out to be right; the models of the IMF (and the Fed) were wrong.
America secured a much lower rate of unemployment without inflation--eventually unemployment fell to below 4%.
But that is not the point: the point is that no one could be sure.
A calculated risk is always unavoidable.
Who bears it varies with different policies, and that is a decision that cannot--or at least should not--be left to central bank technocrats.
While there is a legitimate debate about the degree of independence accorded to central banks and other decision-making bodies, within a democracy, the perspectives of those whose well-being is affected by the decisions taken should be represented in the process.
Workers, for instance, who have much to lose if the central bank pursues an excessively tight policy, do not have a seat at the table.
But financial markets--which do not have much to lose from unemployment, but are affected by inflation--are typically well represented.
And yet financial markets hardly have a monopoly on technical competency.
Indeed, many in the financial community have little understanding of the intricate workings of the macroeconomic system--as evidenced by their frequent mistakes in managing it.
For example, most US recessions since 1945 were caused by the Fed stepping on the brakes too hard.
Similarly, central banks adopted monetarism with a fervor in the late 1970's and early 1980's, just as empirical evidence discrediting the underlying theories was mounting.
Whatever the merits of a common currency, those in Europe deliberating about adopting the Euro should consider whether to tie their fortunes to an institutional arrangement whose flaws are increasingly apparent.
Likewise, developing countries need to consider not only the central bank's independence, but also its mandate and representativeness.
They need to balance concerns about economic efficiency with those of democratic accountability.
In many new democracies, citizens are bewildered.
The virtues of the new regime are first praised, but then they are told that the macroeconomic policy decisions about which they care most are too important to be left to democratic processes.
Citizens are warned against the risks of populism (meaning the will of the people?).
There are no easy answers.
But in too many countries, nor is there democratic debate about the alternatives.

Net-Zero at Davos
DAVOS – At its annual flagship meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this year, the World Economic Forum called on companies from around the world to commit to reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 at the latest.
Climate science shows us that such reductions are necessary both to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and to prevent catastrophic climate change.
Naturally, we at the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) welcome the WEF’s challenge to the global business community.
It is both timely and appropriate.
It makes clear to business leaders that, as members of the “Davos elite,” they have a responsibility to set an example by taking bold, immediate action to reduce emissions.
And this year’s meeting, the WEF notes, “is a perfect opportunity” to demonstrate leadership on this critical issue.
On my first full day in Davos, I attended a breakfast session where Royal DSM CEO Feike Sijbesma spoke about what it means to be part of that Davos elite.
He reminded everyone in the room that with this special status comes a unique responsibility to make the world a better place.
To my mind, the French expression noblesse oblige captures this idea quite well.
This year especially, acting responsibly means taking concrete steps to address the climate crisis.
If global business leaders fail to meet their obligations on this issue – if they do not fulfill the duty that comes with their privileged position – society, and particularly younger people, will no longer have any reason to accept their leadership.
Moreover, if the world’s governments do not implement the policies that climate science has already shown to be necessary, those in power will bear the blame.
The climate crisis has made environmental stewardship an essential feature of leadership itself.
Any leader who ignores the climate imperative is not a leader at all.
On my second day in Davos, I joined another breakfast session, this time hosted by BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, representing $7 trillion in assets.
This year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s annual letter to investors included a new commitment to consider climate change and sustainability as key elements in all of the company’s investment decisions.
Fink evidently understands the responsibility that comes with great power, and he has positioned BlackRock as Exhibit A of how corporate leaders are beginning to shift direction in response to the climate crisis.
There is also a growing recognition among the Davos elite that sustainable solutions are also often the most profitable.
There are countless business opportunities along the path toward a clean-energy transition.
Along with Fink, the BlackRock breakfast included many of the business and finance leaders who will be on the front lines of shepherding their sectors into a low-carbon future.
Together, these members of the Davos elite are starting to realize this point.
These leaders’ acknowledgement of the urgency of fulfilling their responsibility for a more sustainable future comes not a moment too soon.
The looming climate crisis is becoming increasingly obvious to observers around the world, not least young people, who are facing a deeply uncertain future.
As the 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg said during her plenary address on the first day of this year’s gathering, “Why is it so important to stay below 1.5°C?
Because even at 1 degree people are dying from climate change … Every fraction of a degree matters.”
For its part, the RMI will be increasing the impact of its work by focusing not only on the critical goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, but also on efforts to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, because that is what the science calls for.
By collaborating across sectors – including electricity, mobility, construction, finance, and harder-to-abate areas like shipping, aviation, concrete, and steel – we are working with business leaders to bring about a faster low-carbon transition.
And we encourage all leaders, in business and beyond, to embrace their responsibilities.
We invite them to join us in demonstrating what real leadership looks like.
Finally, the RMI is joining the WEF in its call to action to business leaders.
We hope those in attendance at Davos will sign on to a statement committing to net-zero emissions by 2050.
Businesses must help lead the clean-energy transition.
Making a public commitment is the first step toward reclaiming the mantle of global leadership.

The Lifesaving Power of Sex Education
NEW YORK – When I was a bright-eyed eighth grader in my native Sri Lanka, I couldn’t wait for my first sex education class.
In our early teens, my classmates and I were as curious as we were clueless about sex and sexuality.
Yet, instead of receiving reliable answers to pressing questions about our bodies, relationships, and sexuality, we were simply handed a book, told to read a particular chapter, and left to figure things out on our own.
Millions of young people around the world have similar experiences, often with serious adverse consequences.
Just as it would be irresponsible to give a child a sports car without teaching them how to drive, it is dangerously negligent to allow young people’s bodies to develop faster than their understanding of sex and sexuality.
Lack of reliable information increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) – including HIV – and teenage pregnancy, which can not only cost the life of the mother, the child, or both, but also perpetuate poverty across generations.
Even for those who are not sexually active, understanding the changes happening to their bodies is vital to protect their health and wellbeing.
In many places, girls begin menstruating without knowing what is happening, leaving them unprepared to protect their health and hygiene – and often experiencing deep shame over a perfectly natural process.
This lack of information – together with the absence of clean sanitary products and private spaces to use them – often leads girls and young women to miss school while menstruating.
Cultural taboos that sanction barring women and girls from public (including religious) spaces during their period, or that even force them to live outside their homes (including in extreme weather) because they are “impure,” compound their sense of shame and the associated risks to their health.
Young people cannot be blamed for making uninformed decisions if adults refuse to inform them.
Yet it is young people who suffer the consequences of those decisions, often for the rest of their lives.
I saw this happen firsthand: girls who were in that classroom with me the day we were told to “figure out” our sexuality became pregnant soon after, left school, and lost any chance to escape poverty.
Why are schools all over the world failing to offer comprehensive sex education?
Often, the answer is that adults fear that such education encourages promiscuity.
According to this logic, those who “know better” – such as parents or doctors – should be the ones making the decisions.
Contrary to the popular misconception that sex education encourages promiscuity and spurs teenage pregnancies, better education merely improves the odds that the sex teenagers have will be safe sex, resulting in lower STI and pregnancy rates, and higher female education rates.
This has far-reaching benefits, from health to gender equality and poverty reduction.
This is not a new insight.
A quarter-century ago, at the groundbreaking International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, 179 governments pledged to provide information to help youth make “responsible” decisions.
According to the ICPD’s Program of Action, education about sexuality is critical to protect adolescents from STIs and unwanted pregnancies, especially at a very young age, when risks are particularly high for mother and baby.
Since then, much progress has been made.
But, with 20,000 girls younger than 18 giving birth every day, mostly in developing countries with dismal access to sexual and reproductive health information, it is clearly nowhere near enough.
Enabling young people to make responsible choices about their bodies and sexuality requires delivering comprehensive sex education to all, in a youth-friendly way that respects their agency and autonomy.
This means creating safe spaces, where they can access contraceptives or ask questions, without fear that their family or friends will find out.
That is the message of the United Nations Population Fund’s new youth strategy, called “My Body, My Life, My World.”
This November, for the 25th anniversary of the ICPD, a high-level conference will be held in Nairobi, Kenya, to mobilize the political will and financial resources needed to implement fully the ICPD Program of Action.
World leaders should come prepared with concrete commitments that show that this time, they’re serious about ensuring that young people everywhere are empowered to make informed choices about their bodies, their lives, and their futures.

The Immorality of Coal
SYDNEY – Momentum seems to be building for a global deal at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this December.
With this sense of optimism comes a keen awareness that the use of fossil fuels must be phased out globally as rapidly as possible.
Indeed, the idea that greenhouse-gas emissions should be reduced to zero by 2050 is gaining wider acceptance.
Early movers are already shaking things up. Universities, pension funds, churches, banks, and even the heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune are pulling their money out of fossil-fuel assets or are considering the possibility of divestment – an option made increasingly attractive by the swiftly falling cost of renewable energy.
In the face of this progress, though, one sector stands apart.
The coal industry seems determined to fight for profits at the expense of the global environment.
Perversely, it is furiously attempting to capture the moral high ground by claiming that coal is essential to ending energy poverty.
Coal companies and their allies argue that limiting coal production would keep the lights off in rural communities by preventing poor countries from building big, cheap power plants. “Let's have no demonization of coal," as one ally, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, put it.
“Coal is good for humanity." Speaking at an event hosted by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that is skeptical of climate change, the United Kingdom's former environment secretary, Owen Paterson, accused climate-change activists of having “African blood" on their hands.
Setting aside the deeply offensive character of such efforts to silence its critics, the coal industry is posing a false choice: end the use of coal or end poverty.
But, though energy is indeed central to efforts to end poverty, one must be clear: at this point in history, coal is not good for anyone.
Consider this: for all of the attention the Ebola virus has received in recent months, coal is a far deadlier killer.
Toxic fly ash kills some 800,000 people per year and sickens millions more.
Beijing's ongoing battle with smog – a problem that has become known as the “airpocalypse" – provides a potent reminder of coal's impact on air quality.
But China's capital is hardly unique in that respect.
Many Indian cities have air pollution that is just as bad – and in some cases far worse.
Coal is also the single largest contributor to climate change, which threatens to put 400 million people in the poorest countries at risk of severe food and water shortages by 2050.
The coal industry is seeking to burden developing countries with the same unsustainable growth model that has brought the earth to the brink of climate disaster.
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has repeatedly warned – and as the experience of countries like the Marshall Islands increasingly demonstrates – climate change is no longer a distant threat.
The terrible consequences of burning fossil fuels are already upon us, and those suffering the most are the world's poor.
Most people understand that coal is a dirty business, one that countries like Australia should abandon for their own economic wellbeing, as well as for the sake of the global climate.
That is why we are witnessing such resistance from the industry.
Coal's day is over, but it is trying desperately to hang on.
The world needs a rapid and fair transition away from dirty energy sources.
That means cleaning up developed economies and working to prevent the massive expansion of industries that damage our collective health and future.
It also means working with developing countries to help them develop modern, clean energy sources that provide cheap, locally produced power, and do not oblige them to buy fossil fuels.
Above all, it means that we must stop telling the poor in developing countries what they should do and start listening to what they want.
And what they want – unfortunately for the coal industry – is clean, affordable energy that powers their present, without costing them their future.

Why Policymakers Should Fear Libra
MUMBAI – Facebook’s new global digital currency, Libra, which the company plans to launch as early as 2020, could transform the world.
But no one – including the founders of this ambitious economic engineering project – can fully anticipate the currency’s possible ramifications.
And monetary policymakers should be especially worried, because they may find it much harder to control unemployment and inflation in a Libra world.
In the first quarter of 2019, Facebook had 2.38 billion monthly active users.
If even a fraction of them begin to use Libra to carry out financial transactions, buy and sell products, and transfer money, the new currency would quickly gain wide acceptance.
Already, the Libra Association, a Geneva-based not-for-profit group that will operate the digital currency, counts companies such as Uber, eBay, Lyft, Mastercard, and PayPal among its founding members.
Libra could, therefore, become a dominant global currency – but one run by a corporation, not a central bank.
Although Libra is based on the same blockchain technology as other cryptocurrencies, it is expected to be much more efficient.
Facebook promises that the Libra system will be able to process 1,000 transactions per second, be user-friendly, and have a transaction cost of virtually zero.
Not surprisingly, the Libra announcement has prompted a flurry of meetings in central banks, at the Bank of International Settlements, and in other multilateral organizations.
Some commentators have welcomed the proposed new private money, while others want governments to stop Libra before it gets off the ground.
Critics of the initiative have several concerns, including the computing power needed to manage the currency, the privacy of users’ data, and the possibility that the new money will nurture illicit activities and markets.
But much more attention needs to be devoted to analyzing how Libra could dramatically change global monetary policymaking.
Most institutional structures and systems in the world economy – barter, banking, paper money, financial markets, and so on – emerged through slow, evolutionary processes.
Deliberate attempts to establish entirely new systems have usually given rise to unanticipated challenges.
The creation of the euro was one such planned act of economic engineering that had unforeseen consequences.
In my book An Economist in the Real World, I discuss how bond yields diverged across the eurozone after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, causing the European sovereign debt crisis that continues to trouble the world economy today.
Ultimately, the crisis stemmed from flaws in the eurozone’s design (a monetary union without an adequate common fiscal policy – a problem that has yet to be addressed).
At this stage, one can only speculate about the problems Libra may cause.
For example, if Libra becomes popular, people will exchange their national currencies – dollars, euros, renminbi, and rupees – for the new digital coin in order to buy and sell the many products that will be priced in it.
Many users may then choose to keep Libra instead of exchanging it back for their own currencies.
Facebook or the Libra Association will therefore continue to hold their national money and earn income on it by investing Libra users’ money.
They will also be tempted to issue extra Libra to earn seigniorage in the same way that central banks do on the national currencies they issue.
Inflation – and policymakers’ reduced ability to control it – has to figure prominently on the list of possible risks.
Usually, when inflation picks up, central banks take steps to control it.
They raise policy rates and increase reserve ratios to help mop up some of the money in circulation.
But the effectiveness of such policies could be vastly diminished if one of the biggest money-creating authorities is a private organization.
And Libra itself could create some inflationary pressures because it is an effective addition to liquidity.
In recent times, high inflation has been seen only in developing economies; thus there is a tendency to presume that advanced economies are immune.
It is therefore sobering to recall that the two most devastating cases of inflation in history were in relatively rich countries: Hungary in 1946 and Germany in 1923.
In Germany, what cost one mark at the start of the inflationary surge cost 100 sextillion marks (one with 23 zeroes after it) barely a year later.
Despite these risks, calling for an immediate halt to Libra may not be the right move.
For starters, it is unclear which existing law could be used to stop the proposed currency.
At one level, Libra is not very different from the legally valid coupons that people acquire with their dollars when entering an amusement park, and then use to pay for food and rides.
And in a globalized world, a country that rejects Libra may find itself gradually isolated by others that take to it.
Policymakers must urgently consider what kind of world private digital money could create.
We may then need new laws and global treaties to mitigate potential negative fallout and curb the power of the organizations that run these new currencies.

The Battle for Ukraine
The old axioms are true: firmness can pay; resolution can see you through.
We who are struggling to maintain our democracy in Ukraine believe this.
Now, more than ever, we must believe this, for Russian troops wearing Ukrainian uniforms have entered our country, because Ukrainian soldiers are refusing to carry out orders to crush those who are demonstrating to defend our democracy.
We will need the solidarity of our neighbors, and of freedom-loving peoples around the world, to assure that our democratic dreams are realized in peace.
The struggle to secure the victory of Viktor Yushchenko, the true winner in last Sunday’s presidential election, as Ukraine’s new president is not one that we sought.
But, that battle for our freedom having been imposed upon us, we will not be found wanting in either courage or resolve.
The days and nights ahead will be difficult, and the secret presence of Russian troops will make them all the more dangerous.
The forces of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych foolishly stuffed ballots and intimidated the country’s electoral commission to an absurd degree.
They then tried to force the Ukrainian people to swallow this sham – threatening to ban public gatherings, close our borders to new visa seekers, and silence any word of our protests on television.
More and more members of a governmental machine that thought it could impose a fraudulent election on Ukraine’s people are shying away from imposing that choice by force.
Members of the army, the security services, and government officials are all balking at doing the bidding of the Yanukovych clique.
Such a volatile ruling elite cannot be counted on to be consistent from now on.
The way ahead is a minefield.
We recognize that an unstable government can swing back to uncompromising intransigence.
It will try to erode our support by infiltrating our protests with loyalists who will carry the virus of defeatism, and it will seek to outflank us by appealing to ordinary, hard-working Ukrainians, worried about feeding and clothing their children, that a tottering economy needs stability to be saved.
It will try to divide the country between Russian and Ukrainian speakers.
But it is too late for divide and misrule strategies to work.
Ukrainians know that the choice they make now, that their decision to stand firm with Viktor Yushchenko today, will determine their freedom forever, as well as the health of their nation – its independence as well as its economic strength.
So we will stand firm in the cold and the snow to see that our democratic choices are respected.
To do otherwise is to surrender not only our freedom, but our hopes for better lives.
We defy those who seek to corrupt our democracy, but we stand with the hand of friendship extended to all of our neighbors, including Russia.
It has no reason to intervene.
A vibrant Ukrainian democracy will need the comradeship of Russia and of Europe to build the kind of society that our people desire.
Our boldness is tinged by realism.
By securing our democracy, we help secure Russia’s own.
For we are engaged not in revolution, but in peaceful democratic evolution.
Ukrainians have endured the worst that man can do to his fellow man: Stalin’s orchestrated famines of the 1930’s and the Nazi slaughterhouse of World War II.
So do not doubt our ability to endure and stand firm.
We shall persist, and our democracy shall prevail.
Stand with us.

The Bank of Japan’s Moment of Truth
TOKYO – The Japanese economy has enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of positive growth, with the average annual rate reaching 1.9%.
With aggregate demand exceeding potential output by 1%, the country’s “GDP gap” is now positive.
Unemployment is down to 2.7%, the lowest level since 1993, and the job-opening-to-application ratio is 1.56, its highest level since 1974, resulting in acute labor shortages in several sectors, including construction, retail, and package delivery.
And in January this year, the Nikkei Stock Average rose above ¥24,000 ($216), its highest level since 1991.
But, while these indicators suggest that Japan is finally out of the woods of more than two decades of stagnation, deflation, and economic insecurity, the headline inflation rate, at just 0.6%, remains far below the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.
And, notably, while the BOJ had been attributing low inflation to falling energy prices, energy is now contributing positively to inflation.
When fresh food is excluded from the price index, the rate rises to 0.9%, but falls to 0.3% when also excluding energy.
Considering the current labor shortages, why Japan has not experienced a healthy wage-inflation spiral remains a mystery.
To be sure, inflation is also missing in the United States and Europe.
But the Japanese case is particularly striking.
Japan’s real economy has been supported for years by fiscal deficits as high as 6% of GDP, and by extraordinary quantitative easing (QE), which BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda introduced in April 2013.
The debt-to-GDP ratio has since risen to 230%, and the BOJ has assumed ownership of more than 40% of outstanding government bonds (JGBs).
The BOJ has maintained its negative policy rate and 0% ten-year-bond rate by purchasing annually ¥80 trillion in JGBs and ¥6 trillion in equities.
But, more recently, it has kept the ten-year-bond rate at 0.0-0.1%, while reducing the pace of new purchases of JGBs to around ¥50 trillion, in what some regard as a stealth tapering.
With Kuroda’s term ending in early April, two camps of critics have become increasingly vocal.
The first camp, arguing that the real economy is what matters, wants the BOJ to stop providing stimulus and start worrying about its bloated balance sheet.
When the inflation rate moves closer to the target, the BOJ will have to start raising its policy and long-term rates without adjusting the size of its balance sheet – which is exactly what the US Federal Reserve is already doing.
Given the low average coupon rate of asset-side long-term bonds, the upward shift of the yield curve will result in a loss for the BOJ (“negative seigniorage”), at least temporarily.
In the worst-case scenario, the BOJ could exhaust its capital and require a fiscal injection, which could jeopardize its independence.
Accordingly, the first camp believes the inflation target should be lowered to 1%.
Inflation would then be on target, and the BOJ could wind down its QE program.
The major drawback of this approach is that it would cause the yen to appreciate sharply, striking a blow to the real economy.
The second camp believes that more stimulus is needed, and that increasing the consumption-tax (VAT) rate in April 2014 was a huge mistake, as is stealth tapering.
Instead, QE and expansionary fiscal policies should remain at full throttle until the 2% inflation target is reached.
That means more government expenditure through more JGB issues, to be purchased by the BOJ – also known as “helicopter money.”
The problem is that intentionally blowing up the budget deficit will increase the risk of a fiscal crisis down the road, without helping the real economy.
When the BOJ held its latest policy-setting meeting on January 22-23, it maintained the approach it has followed for more than a year.
Kuroda and his deputy governors are probably hoping that the real economy’s strong performance will translate into higher inflation soon.
But will it?
Generally, three keys to higher inflation are wage increases, resulting from labor scarcity; expectations of higher future inflation among the public; and a favorable external environment.
With respect to wages, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has been pressuring major corporations to raise wages by 3% or more.
That should be manageable, considering that many corporations are enjoying record profits.
And yet unions in Japan remain timid, and workers remain traumatized from 15 years of deflation.
As a result, many choose job security over pay hikes.
Demanding higher wages, they fear, would give companies an excuse to move operations abroad or adopt labor-replacing technologies.
As for the second ingredient, the BOJ has admitted that it underestimated the difficulty of influencing inflation expectations when it introduced its QE program in April 2013.
In Japan, the expected inflation rate, however it is measured, tends to track the actual inflation rate, albeit with some lag.
This helps to explain why simply announcing a 2% target has not anchored the public’s expectations, as it has in the US.
At the same time, the external environment is promising.
Almost every other advanced economy is experiencing steady, synchronized growth.
And emerging economies, especially China, have also regained strength.
At the level of the global economy at least, the stars seem to be aligned for inflation to reach the 2% target rate in Japan, the US, and the eurozone.
In Japan, the Phillips curve tends to be L-shaped.
Right now, the economy is very close to the kink in the “L,” the point known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).
Any sign of a vertical move (implying higher inflation with an unemployment rate at NAIRU), rather than a horizontal one (a lower unemployment rate without CPI inflation), will be welcomed by the BOJ, and good for the economy at large.

Thailand's Stumbling Thaksin Revolution
BANKOK: The arrival of Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party into power last year supposedly marked a new day in Thai politics.
Now, with crackdowns on foreign and domestic journalists, Prime Minister Thaksin's government seems to be retreating into Thailand's history of authoritarian rule.
Thaksin's electoral victory in January 2001 was something new here.
For the first time, a Thai political leader asked the mass of the people to vote for him because he promised to do something for them.
He understood (where his rivals did not) that major changes had occurred over the previous decade, and that the Thai people were no longer afraid to demand change.
Once in power, Thaksin named bright, committed reformers to several key ministries and negotiated a ``peace treaty'' with the umbrella protest group the ``Assembly of the Poor,'' after which it lifted its two-year siege of Government House.
Most remarkably, he implemented (or tried to implement) his entire electoral platform.
He provided farmers with debt relief, dished out village funds, and rolled out cheap health care.
He delivered on other promises to NGOs and social leaders, such as a community forestry bill.
The Democrat Party, which headed the previous government, claimed that it offered similar reforms and cannot understand why the voters rejected them.
The answer is simple.
The Democrats asked people to sit quietly and trust the bureaucrats and politicians to look after their interests.
Demands and protests - the Democrats huffed - will get you nowhere.
That old bureaucratic paternalism, Thaksin knew, was ripe for overthrow.
During the election, Thaksin played Thailand's traditional ``money politics'' even better than the old political hands.
He cajoled bosses from other parties into his own.
TRT candidates threw money around during the campaign as effectively as their opponents.
This combination of the new (popular policies) and the old (money politics) brought the TRT its landslide victory.
But, by absorbing some of the old fixers into TRT, Thaksin also absorbed a lobby antagonistic to reform.
The TRT's MPs and cabinet ministers fall into two roughly equal groups: old political hands in their mid-50s, and newcomers in their mid-30s.
Each group represents a different generation with different attitudes.
Older TRT members mostly treat politics as a commercial proposition and see reform as a threat.
Some of the strongest resistance comes from within TRT.
Hand-picked to implement reform, some of Thaksin's ministers are now flash points for clashes between the new and old politics.
Kasem Wattanachai quit as education minister after confronting resistance from the education bureaucracy.
Interior minister Purachai Piumsomboon is hounded because his clean-up campaign affects the police, protection rackets, and the entertainment mafia.
Praphat Panyachartrak, responsible for most rural reform, had to fend off an attempt to discredit him as a land-grabber.
These attacks are worsening and expose the limits of Thaksin's electoral revolution, for although the prime minister's party appealed for a popular vote, it lacks a mass membership base.
Like other Thai parties of the last two decades, TRT is built around one man, his bank account, and his family and friends.
Because of this lack of grassroots political organization, the TRT is incapable of linking its electoral support with the day-to-day work of government.
Skilled at day-to-day political games, the TRT's old political hands are growing stronger.
If Purachai or any other key reform minister falls, other reformers may begin to fall like dominoes.
Should the reformers compromise to survive, those dominoes will merely be falling in the dark.
Keeping things quiet may be one reason animating the recent campaign to dampen the enthusiasm of Thailand's usually buoyant journalists.
Even before the election, Thaksin sought control of the media.
He bought Thailand's only independent TV station and sacked 23 journalists for being too independent.
Since then, serious political commentary has disappeared from radio and TV.
Thailand's lively press is intimidated by the manipulation of the large advertising budgets of Thaksin-owned companies and government agencies.
The old guard in TRT welcome this suppression. They are no friends of free expression.
But for many of the reformers in TRT, the media issue is a personal crisis.
Some were blooded in politics during the students revolts of the 1970s who later backed a movement that, over two decades, gradually penned the Thai military back into its barracks and entrenched electoral democracy.
They reveled in the gradual opening of space to debate and challenge the social order.
They joined Thaksin's TRT because it seemed to represent another step on the path of progress.
Now the TRT looks more and more like Thailand's other ``Messiah parties'' of recent years, built around a knight on a white horse who turns out to be a troll mounted on a toad.
Thaksin will likely survive this crisis because the new constitution strengthens the premier and the rival Democrats remain in near terminal disarray.
But his ``revolution,'' no matter how much he cows and cajoles the press into speaking well of him, will have died.
The threat he now faces is that those who once ardently believed in his revolution will rebel against him.

Washington and the Art of the Possible
CHICAGO – These days, the United States media are full of ordinary Americans venting their rage at the incompetence and immaturity of their politicians.
Even though the US government’s debt limit was raised in the nick of time, the process was – and remains – fraught with risk.
Why, the public asks, can’t politicians sit down together like sensible adults and come up with a timely agreement that commands broad consensus?
If we can balance our household budgets, they ask irately, why can’t our political leaders?
The reality, though, is that US politicians reflect the views of the American electorate – views that are fundamentally inconsistent.
The absence of broad consensus is no wonder.
Indeed, the last-minute agreement to raise the debt ceiling is proof that the politicians did what they were sent to Washington to do: represent their constituencies and only compromise in the interests of the country as a whole.
The key question is whether the political gridlock exposed by the debt-ceiling debate will worsen in the run-up to the 2012 presidential and congressional elections – if not beyond.
That is possible, but we should not overlook cause for hope in what America’s politicians just accomplished.
Let’s start with why the electorate is so polarized.
There are two key divisive factors: income and age.
Income inequality has been growing in the US over the last three decades, largely because the labor market has increasingly demanded skills that the education system has been unable to supply.
The everyday consequence for the middle class is a stagnant paycheck and growing employment insecurity, as the old economy of well-paying low-skilled jobs with good benefits withers away.
Until the financial crisis, the easy availability of credit, especially against home equity, enabled the middle class to sustain higher consumption despite stagnant incomes.
With the collapse of the housing bubble, many people lost their jobs and health insurance, risked losing their homes, and suddenly had little reason for economic optimism.
The response from America’s Democratic Party, which has traditionally represented this constituency, was to promise affordable universal health care and more education spending, while also protecting government jobs and entitlement programs.
When added up, such spending is unaffordable, especially with current federal revenues at just 15% of GDP.
The solution for many Democrats is to raise revenues by taxing the rich.
But the rich are not the idle rich of the past; they are the working rich.
To balance the budget only by taxing the rich will require a significant increase in income taxes, to the point that it would lower incentives for work and entrepreneurial activity considerably.
This is not to say that taxes on the rich cannot be increased at all; but such increases cannot be the primary way of balancing the budget.
Republicans, trying to give voice to many working Americans’ ambient uneasiness with rising government expenditures, as well as to the growing anger of the working rich, find it easier to defend a principle than a particular constituency.
Hence their mantra: no additional taxes.
The neat divide based on income is muddled by the elderly.
It is understandable that older Americans who have few savings want to protect their Social Security and Medicare benefits.
However, even elderly Tea Party Republicans, who are typically against big government, defend these programs because they view them as a form of property right, paid for when they worked.
In truth, rising life expectancy and growing health-care costs mean that today’s elderly have contributed only a fraction of what they expect to receive from Social Security and Medicare.
The government made a mistake in the past by not raising taxes to finance these programs or reducing the benefits that they promised.
Unless the growth of these entitlement programs is curbed now, today’s young will pay dearly for that mistake, in the form of higher taxes now and lower benefits when they are old.
But the elderly are politically active and powerful.
Not only do many defend their entitlements strongly; some oppose growth in other types of public spending for fear that it will weaken the government’s ability to pay for the benefits that they believe they are owed.
These then are the roots of America fiscal impasse, which has produced passionate constituencies viscerally opposed to compromise.
Any political deal significantly before the debt-ceiling deadline would have exposed politicians to charges of betrayal from their constituents.
And, given that President Barack Obama would ultimately be held responsible for a default, he needed the deal more than the Republicans did.
So he had to coerce his party into accepting a deal full of spending cuts and devoid of tax increases.
Will the deal deliver what it promises?
A bipartisan committee has to propose $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction by the end of this year, and Congress must either accept that proposal, or see immediate, politically painful expenditure cuts, which would include defense spending – an area that America’s Republicans care about strongly.
If this structure works as advertised, Congress will be forced to reach a compromise, which can be sold once again by politicians to their polarized constituencies as being necessary to avoid a worse outcome.
This time, Obama’s Democrats will be on a level playing field, because both parties will be held equally responsible for a failure to reach a deal.
Ultimately, the big necessary decisions on curbing entitlement growth and reforming the tax code will probably have to wait until after the next election, giving the divided electorate an opportunity to reflect on its own inconsistency and send a clearer message.
In the meantime, US politicians might have done just about enough to convince debt markets that America’s credit is still good.
For that, Americans – and others around the world – should stop pillorying them and give them their due credit.

The Kursk and Russia’s Democracy
MOSCOW: Will the sinking of the submarine Kursk and the death of all its crew also sink the Putin revolution?
Until now President Putin’s power was unique in Russian history – it was based on his vast popularity, one legitimized by the vote.
He could browbeat Russia’s oligarchs into submission and recast the upper house of the Duma to make it bend to his will because he was universally popular and the other elements of Russia’s mostly discredited government knew it.
His handling of the Kursk crisis, however, dented that democratic mandate because Putin seemed as contemptuous of human life as all his predecessors in the Kremlin.
How well he recovers will determine whether or not Putin’s revolution will remain a democratic one, or whether he will revert to autocracy to pursue his goals.
I have no doubt that Putin will find people to blame for the failure to seek outside help for the Kursk in time.
Indeed, the Kursk crisis may provide him with an opportunity to further clean house in the military.
The first tests of his ability to recover are the looming regional elections across Russia.
Between October and December over 40% of our country’s governorships will be up for grabs in new elections.
As a restoration of Moscow’s authority over the country is a central plank in the president’s platform, he needs to restore his popularity fast.
Although Putin's reforms to the upper house of the Duma have already stripped the governors of their status as federal power brokers as well as of their parliamentary immunity, governorships retain wide powers in their regions.
Few can now strut the national stage, or thumb their nose at the Kremlin, as they did during the Yeltsin era, but their powers are real and reigning them in won’t be easy.
Putin’s dominance has already changed the way these campaigns will be run. Money is now less important than even a year ago.
What matters now is control over administrative power, and the appointment of presidential prefects throughout Russia gives the Kremlin a powerful hand in directing state administration.
Since campaigns will be cheaper, governors will find it hard to buy reelection because opponents will be able to mount a credible opposition.
Even if a governor wants to buy an election, the sources of campaign cash are drying up.
The oligarchs, who once sought close ties to regional bosses in hope of securing the help of governors in taking control of local factories, mines, and other assets, have been cowed by Putin.
Indeed, the President’s blunt "message" to them is clear: stay out of politics.
But if Russia’s richest men think the president damaged seriously, they may jump back into politics and fund his regional opponents.
Still, even if weakened, Putin benefits from a changed economy.
Only 17.9% of potential voters now deem the country’s situation as "catastrophic", a much smaller proportion than at any time since communism’s end; only 15.6% say that they live below the poverty line.
So the protest vote is falling.
Moreover, economic growth is everywhere to be seen.
In some places, the Chelyabinsk region, for example, it is up a whopping 25% on a year ago.
This "economic miracle" in some parts of the Federation means that some regions have long since paid their pension and wage arrears.
A democratic "feel good" factor is in play.
Here, Putin has delivered something unique in Russian history: people are more satisfied with their government’s economic performance, not because of propaganda, but because their lives are visibly improving.
This means that the great battle of communists versus democratic reformers, that dominated every election since 1991, is a thing of the past.
People do not care a bit about ideology.
They are more concerned about prices, job opportunities, healthcare and education.
They want a government that reflects their human values, as the response to the Kursk shows.
Gripes about restrictions on freedom of expression or economic freedom, which are popular in Moscow, have few echoes in the provinces.
So, even if Putin remains weakened, the Kremlin can look forward to getting rid of the notorious "Red Governors" of Bryansk, Volgograd and Voronezh through the normal workings of democracy; that is, if the Kremlin makes certain that votes in these regions are relatively honest.
The same holds true in regions with well-known but wayward governors such as Kursk with Governor Rutskoi (who led the coup against Yeltsin of October, 1993) and Kaliningrad’s corrupt Governor Gorbenko.
But in those regions headed by strong politicians – Astrakhan, Chelyabinsk, Krasnodar and Stavropol regions, for example – the damage Putin has suffered in the past week makes it unlikely that he will be able to oust leaders who oppose him.
In this, there is something vaguely reassuring.
Presidential power it appears is now dependent on popular support, and isn’t the consent of the governed what democracy is all about?
If this proves to be the case, perhaps the sailors of the Kursk will not have died in vain.

Education Without Borders
LONDON – As the third anniversary of the start of Syria’s civil war approaches, there is a race against time to deliver a groundbreaking education project to the conflict’s hardest-hit victims – hundreds of thousands of child refugees.
A shocking three million Syrian children have now been displaced.
More than one million of them have fled Syria and are languishing in camps in neighboring countries, particularly Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.
These children are now suffering a third winter away from their homes, schools, and friends.
Many are separated from their families, and thousands more join the ranks of displaced persons every day in what is becoming the largest humanitarian catastrophe of our time.
But a pathbreaking initiative in Lebanon, involving teachers, aid agencies, and education charities has opened a small window of hope.
Amid the chaos of camps, makeshift huts, and destitution, the fight for an important new principle of international aid has begun: even in times of conflict, children must have access to education.
A century and a half ago, the Red Cross established the norm that health care could – and should – be provided even in conflict zones.
This principle was carried forward by groups like Médicins sans Frontières, whose doctors have risked their lives for the last four decades to deliver medical care to the world’s most dangerous places.
Now Lebanon is the site of a pilot program to advance the idea that providing education for refugee children is equally feasible – and no less important.
Across 1,500 communities in this troubled, divided country, where Syrian refugee children now make up 20% of the school-age population, the aim is to establish children’s right to education as a humanitarian priority.
The typical refugee child spends more than ten years away from home.
And every month that a child is out of school makes it less likely that they will ever return.
Three years ago, most Syrian children were at school, and the country had near universal primary education.
Today, millions of children are being denied any chance to realize their talents.
The scars will last for decades.
So, in Syria and the surrounding region, there is already a lost generation in the making: children who are now eight and nine and who have never been to school, children condemned to work as child laborers, and hundreds of girls forced into early marriages.
There are gruesome tales of young people who have been forced to sell their kidneys and other organs simply to survive.
Of course, we must provide food, shelter, and vaccinations.
But, in conflicts like these, the one thing that children need, beyond the material basics, is hope.
And it is education that provides children with hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel – hope that they can plan for the future and prepare for jobs and adulthood.
The pilot project in Lebanon, designed by Kevin Watkins of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Development Institute and led by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), creates the opportunity to establish a right to education irrespective of borders.
Indeed, it is designed to cater to all 435,000 Syrian child refugees now in the country.
Thanks to a historic agreement with the Lebanese government, places for hundreds of thousands of children can be created within weeks by putting 1,500 of Lebanon’s schools on a double-shift system.
The scheme is already being piloted in a small village called Akroum in the north of the country.
Lebanese children are taught during the first shift, and Syrian children in the second.
Using the same school for both sets of pupils means that education can be delivered at a cost of only £400 ($670) per child per year.
To secure places for all refugee children, we are seeking $195 million dollars a year for UNICEF and UNHCR, with the plan to be implemented on the ground by NGOs and the Lebanese authorities.
The aim is to secure all funding during March, as the world marks the third anniversary of this tragic exodus from Syria.
We have already assembled a coalition of ten donor countries to take the lead, but we need ten more donors to fund the project fully.
We are appealing to donors not just to create thousands of school places for desperately needy children, but also to establish a precedent for the 20 million other children driven by violent conflict into displaced-persons camps and shantytowns.
There cannot be universal educational opportunity for the worlds’ children without an agreement that we will cater to children in conflict zones.
One million Afghan children are in camps along the border with Pakistan.
Thousands of children in South Sudan still await their first chance to go to school, and schools have yet to be provided for a million more children in the war-torn Central African Republic.
These children’s chances now depend on showing that we can make progress in Lebanon.
The UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, expire in December 2015, which means that time is running to meet the deadline for achieving the target of universal primary education.
That goal will remain unattainable unless and until we establish the long-overdue principle that a child’s right to education knows no boundaries.

Reading Israel from Left to Right
NEW YORK – Israel’s current government and its supporters in the West are quick to denounce criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism.
This can be inaccurate and self-serving, but it is not always wrong.
Israel’s defenders are right to point out that public opinion in Europe, and to a much lesser extent in the United States, tends to be much more critical of Israeli atrocities in Gaza than about bloodier violence committed by Muslims against Muslims in other parts of the Middle East.
This can be explained by the fact that Israel is supported by Western governments and generously subsidized by American taxpayers.
There is not much that public outrage can do about the behavior of Iranian mullahs or Syrian thugs.
But Israel is “one of us.”
To be sure, excessive zeal in denouncing Israel, and cheap comparisons between Israeli violence and Nazi mass murder, betray a dubious urge to throw off the burdens of guilt.
After decades of feeling obliged to drop the collective European head in shame for what was done to the Jews, people can finally say with an element of glee that Jews can be murderers, too.
But, though unseemly, this is not necessarily anti-Semitic.
Anti-Zionism takes a nasty turn to anti-Semitism when it conflates Jews with Israelis – for example, when the British Liberal Democratic politician David Ward criticized “the Jews” for inflicting horrors on the Palestinians.
And, while one can be skeptical about Zionism as a historical project, to deny Israel’s right to exist is hard to distinguish from anti-Semitism.
The most sinister form of anti-Zionism is to be found among leftists who see Israel and the US as the planet’s twin evils.
Those who see dark American forces behind all that is wrong with the world, from financial crashes to the violence in Ukraine, are prone to detect the malign hand of Israeli or even Jewish lobbies in every US policy.
The link between corrupting Jewish influence and the US was originally a right-wing trope.
Jews were supposedly rootless, clannish, and omnipotent, with no loyalty to any nation.
The immigrant society of the US was seen as rootless by definition.
In the view of early-twentieth-century right-wing European nationalists, Anglo-American capitalism, controlled by Jews, undermined the sacred ties of blood and soil.
This worldview also blamed the Jews for Bolshevism, which might seem like a contradiction, but is not.
Bolshevism, like capitalism, was internationalist, at least in theory.
(Joseph Stalin was actually a Soviet nationalist who also denounced Jews as rootless cosmopolitans.)
The dangers of zealous anti-Semitic attacks on Israel are obvious.
If Israel was not just a fearful nation oppressing the Palestinian people, but the source of all evil, any form of violence, however destructive of self and others, could be justified.
If the Israel Defense Forces were the modern equivalent of the Nazis, it should be smashed with maximum force.
If all Jews were responsible for the oppression of Arabs, attacks on Jews in Europe, or anywhere else, should be condoned, if not actively encouraged.
The number of people in the West who really hold such beliefs is, I believe, small.
Such people exist in universities.
They write blogs.
They march together in demonstrations with some indisputably anti-Semitic Islamist militants.
But they are far from the mainstream.
Remarkably, some of Israel’s most ardent admirers are now to be found on the right – and even the far right.
Quite a few are members of political parties with a profoundly anti-Semitic provenance, such as Austria’s Freedom Party, whose early members included former Nazis.
The Freedom Party leader, along with such luminaries of the populist right as Filip Dewinter, the Flemish nationalist leader, and the Dutch demagogue Geert Wilders, have visited the West Bank and voiced their support for Israeli settlements.
This can be explained partly by antagonism against Islam.
Right-wing populists in Europe regard Islam as the greatest threat to the West.
So, naturally, they applaud the Israeli government for using harsh measures to keep the Arabs down.
As Wilders put it, the Israelis “are fighting our fight.
If Jerusalem falls, Amsterdam and New York will be next.”
But the main reason for this new solidarity between Western right-wing populists and the state of Israel might lie deeper than shared antipathy toward Islam.
No state is static, and Israel has changed a great deal since the heroic decades after its founding in 1948.
In the early years, Israel was admired by Western leftists for being a progressive state, run by Polish and Russian socialists.
Today’s Israeli leaders, however, in their rhetoric and behavior, often sound more like the old European anti-Semites.
Israeli Jews are now firmly rooted in their own national soil.
But the ruling ideology is no longer socialism; it is a form of ethnic nationalism, with a great deal of military swagger.
No wonder, then, that Israel’s current admirers have a distinctly illiberal cast.
They reflect current mainstream opinion more than leftist anti-Zionists do.
The world is increasingly fragmenting, with fearful people embracing smaller, defensive identities: Scottish, Catalan, Flemish, Sunni, Shia, Kurdish, and so on.
The idealistic internationalism of the early postwar years is collapsing fast.
Tribal feelings – national, ethnic, and religious – are filling the vacuum.
And, most ironic of all, Israel, a nation-state built by a people despised for their cosmopolitanism, has become a prime symbol of this disturbing trend.

Who Lost Turkey?
PARIS – “Who lost Turkey?” That question, often raised in the past, has been heating up in the aftermath of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s emotional outburst during the recent World Economic Forum 2009 in Davos, when he abruptly left a panel he was sharing with Israeli President Shimon Peres.
And the Turkish question matters greatly, because it touches on some of the most unstable and unsettling of the world’s diplomatic disputes.
If Turkey has indeed been “lost,” those responsible include the European Union, the United States, Israel, and Turkey itself.
The EU’s growing reservations about Turkey’s membership have been expressed unambiguously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
In the US, former President George W. Bush gets some of the blame because of the war in Iraq.
Israel, too, has played its part in Turkey’s alienation from the West, as a result of the Lebanon war of 2006 and its recent military operations in Gaza.
All of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey, and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930’s.
Of course, Turkey’s secular, pro-Western elites may still consider the EU and the US important, if not indispensable, allies and partners, and they may consider Islamic fundamentalism, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran real or at least potential threats.
Yet they are also convinced that Europe has behaved improperly toward Turkey, through a combination of short-term populist reflexes and the absence of a long-term strategic vision.
The Turkish question is, of course, complex.
Turkey’s geography is predominantly Asian, Turkey’s emotions are increasingly Middle Eastern, i.e., Muslim on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and yet Turkey’s elites remain resolutely pro-Western and pro-European.
But for how long?
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, when dialogue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world’s key challenges, Europe would commit a historic strategic blunder if it were to close its doors to Turkey.
To do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian, Muslim, and Middle Eastern historical trajectory.
In the question of Turkish accession to the EU, the journey matters more than the destination.
The reforms that Turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time, thanks to its EU candidate status, are impressive.
Should we in Europe really put at risk that progress by expressing an all-too-audible “no”?
The EU desperately needs a strategic and diplomatic partner that can significantly reinforce its clout in the Middle East.
Europe also needs the dynamism of a youthful Turkey.
Above all, it needs the message of reconciliation sent to Islam that Turkey’s entrance into the Union would represent.
Of course, to want Turkey “in” is an act of will, if not an act of faith that is in many ways counterintuitive.
Most Europeans do not perceive Turkey as a “European Other” but as a “non-European Other.”
Even in Istanbul, the most Westernized of Turkish cities, as soon as one leaves the main arteries, one seems to be immersed in a Middle Eastern or Asian culture.
Israel is not in the European Union, but it, too, is in great danger of losing Turkey.
Far from reinforcing Israel’s security, its last two military adventures, in Lebanon and now in Gaza, have caused further self-isolation and loss of world sympathy.
Nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in Turkey, where those military escapades have strained the two countries’ strategic alliance almost to the breaking point.
It is too early to speak of Obama’s policy towards Turkey; suffice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with Islam, he is the only Western leader to move in the right direction.
But can positive American gestures towards Turkey, a key NATO member, be sufficient to offset Israel’s insensitive, if not reckless, policies?
The answer is unclear.
Turkey, too shares some of the responsibility for this mounting process of estrangement. Erdogan’s behavior in Davos was, at the very least, irresponsible.
He may have gained popularity back home, but in today’s difficult economic times, the temptations of cheap populism are more dangerous than ever.
One does not play lightly with matches next to a pile of dry wood.

Japan’s War Guilt Revisited
“It is our obligation as Japan’s most influential newspaper to tell our readers who was responsible for starting the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War.” So writes Tsuneo Watanabe, Editor-in-Chief of Japan’s (and the world’s) most widely circulated newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun , in the introduction to the book From Marco Polo Bridge to Pearl Ha rbor: Who Was Responsible .
Watanabe, who is now in his eighties and served in the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII, was bothered by the way unfinished business concerning the war continued to hinder Japan’s progress.
As a remedy, he set up a War Responsibility Re-Examination Committee at his newspaper to undertake a 14-month investigation into the causes of Japan’s Pacific War.
Watanabe tells us that the Committee concluded that, “not only high-ranking government leaders, general, and admirals should shoulder the blame.” According to the Committee, “field officers were often more influential than even the Emperor, war ministers, and chiefs-of-staffs in making decisions to go to and escalate the wars, and were responsible for many atrocities.”
It has never been easy for a nation to face up honestly to the bitter fact of having committed war crimes, genocide, unjustified foreign aggression, or having mistreated and killed its own people.
Japan is no exception.
Although there have been numerous initiatives to investigate its war guilt, especially its occupation of China, there has not yet been an official effort comparable to what the Germans undertook to take collective responsibility for their war crimes.
While Yomiuri’s unique public effort is not a government initiative, it comes as close as Japan will probably ever get to conducting an acceptable “official” inquiry and offering an adequate apology.
Its style is almost scientific – factual, staccato-like, and unemotional – and it goes a long way toward meeting China’s demand for a convincing investigation and act of contrition that might allow the bitter and still poisonous past to be overcome.
Watanabe laments the fact that after Japanese war criminals were tried by the Tokyo Tribunal of 1951, “No efforts were made in the name of Japan or the Japanese people to look into where responsibility for the war rested.” As a result, “there can be no genuinely honest and friendly dialogue with those countries that suffered considerable damage and casualties in the wars with Japan.”
China’s leaders seem to have taken note of this moment of Japanese remorse.
This implies a ray of hope for a bilateral relationship – the most important in Asia – that over the past two decades has been battered by Japan’s reluctance to face its past, which has become a lightning rod for over-heated nationalist sentiment on both sides.
But does the Yomiuri study go far enough?
While it assigns responsibility to Japan for WWII, and even unflinchingly names the political and military leaders who bear responsibility, one can still detect a whiff of reluctance in its failure to fully describe some of Japan’s war-time actions.
For example, the horrors of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937, when Japanese soldiers killed 45,000-250,000 Chinese – many of whom were civilians – are given little more than a brief mention.
But it would be a pity if China’s leaders did not endorse this acknowledgement of Japanese guilt as a manifestation of Japan’s willingness to repent.
The damaged bilateral relationship has only made China’s desire for a “peaceful rise” more uncertain.
At the same time, it has left Japan’s long sought transcendence of its war guilt and quasi-pariah status incomplete.
Watanabe and Yomiuri Shimbun have provided a rare opportunity that should be seized for the greater good of China and Japan and the world.
Of course, it is always easier to export blame than to shoulder it.
And, true, no Japanese prime minister has yet fallen to his knees in Nanjing the way Chancellor Willy Brandt did on the site of the Warsaw Ghetto, where he apologized for the crimes of Germany by saying, “No people can escape from their history.”
But that was in 1970, when memories of the war’s ravages were fresh. Now, over half-a-century has elapsed.
“If things are left as they are,” writes Watanabe, “a skewed perception of history – without knowledge of the horrors of the war – will be handed down to future generations.” It would be an immensely encouraging sign of China’s growing maturity if its leaders used this moment to look beyond the bitter past toward a new future with Japan.

Earth Calling the Financial Sector
NEW YORK – Financial markets serve two crucial purposes: to channel savings toward productive investments, and to enable individuals and businesses to manage risks through diversification and insurance.
As a result, the sector is essential to sustainable development, which represents unprecedented global-scale investment opportunities and risk-management challenges.
That is why, when world leaders meet this July in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at the Conference on Financing for Development, the financial industry should be ready to offer practical, global solutions to the challenges associated with financing economic growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability.
We have now entered the Year of Sustainable Development.
At three back-to-back global summits – the conference in Addis Ababa, September's meeting at the United Nations to adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December – 193 governments will attempt to ensure that global growth and poverty reduction continue within a safe natural environment.
It will be a close call.
The global economy, despite all of the huge bumps in the road, is delivering aggregate annual growth of 3-4%, leading to a doubling of output every generation.
Yet the global economy is not delivering sustainable growth in two basic senses.
In many parts of the world, growth has been deeply skewed in favor of the rich; and it has been environmentally destructive – indeed, life-threatening when viewed on a century-long time scale, rather than according to quarterly reports or two-year election cycles.
Climate change is the greatest of these environmental threats (though by far not the only one).
Given the current trajectory of global fossil-fuel use, the planet's temperature is likely to rise by 4-6 degrees Celsius above its pre-industrial level, an increase that would be catastrophic for food production, human health, and biodiversity; indeed, in many parts of the world, it would threaten communities' survival.
Governments have already agreed to keep warming below 2º Celsius but have yet to take decisive action toward creating a low-carbon energy system.
The financial industry has a central role to play in catalyzing the global transition to inclusive, sustainable growth.
After all, effective financial markets should convey accurate long-term information to savers and investors, thereby enabling businesses, pension funds, insurance pools, sovereign wealth funds, and others to allocate their resources to projects that provide solid long-term payoffs, and protect their savings from financial calamities.
Given climate change, that means accounting for whether, say, entire low-lying coastal areas or agricultural regions will be able to cope.
Effective financial markets should also channel far more global saving from high-income countries with relatively weak long-term growth prospects to low-income regions with relatively strong growth prospects, owing to new opportunities to leapfrog development with smart, information-based infrastructure.
Just a decade ago, hundreds of millions of rural Africans lived outside of the flow of global information.
Now, with the rapid spread of broadband, once-isolated villages benefit from online banking, transport services, and ICT-enabled agribusiness and health and education programs.
To seize the benefits of these new technologies at scale, and to avoid investments that aggravate cascading environmental crises, the finance industry will need to understand how the SDGs will reshape the investment landscape.
The time has come to embrace the concept of true long-term investing, which requires marshaling the capacity of institutionally mobilized capital to support investment opportunities that will secure a sustainable future for all.
We know that enormous public and private investment is required for the transition toward a low-carbon economy, to win the global fight against poverty and disease, and to provide high-quality education and physical infrastructure worldwide.
Today's savvy investors, and the financial industry as a whole, need to look ahead, beyond today's market prices and policies to the market prices and policies of the future.
For example, today there is no global price on carbon to shift energy investment from fossil fuels to renewable sources; but we know that, in order to keep global warming below the 2º limit, such a price is coming soon.
As stewards of long-term capital, today's investors cannot ignore the coming carbon price and the shift toward low-carbon energy sources.
That means devising practical ways to finance and encourage the required shift.
We believe that financial leaders want their industry to play its vital role in sustainable development, and we urge them to contribute actively to the unique opportunity that this year represents.
Today's financiers can choose to be remembered either for the 2008 crisis, over which they presided, or for their creative and resourceful efforts to encourage long-term sustainability.
Assuming that they choose the latter, the financial industry should work with governments to create a global investment framework that includes appropriate incentives to take on the challenges of sustainable growth.
This implies the continued globalization of finance, which will be essential to allocate money from capital-rich regions to their poor, capital-scarce counterparts, as well as to develop local capital markets that can facilitate capital formation and protect countries from the vagaries of global sentiment.
Financial leaders should also involve citizens (the savers) in the journey to a fairer and more sustainable global economy.
That means encouraging responsible investing by adopting ever higher standards of stewardship – for example, by requiring companies' portfolios to meet certain sustainability targets.
It also means contributing to a new framework for global infrastructure investment that steers resources away from environmentally destructive projects and reduces the wastage often associated with political patronage.
Since the Industrial Revolution, finance has been a powerful enabler of human progress.
The great task of this generation's financial leaders is to mobilize investment in the skills, infrastructure, and sustainable technologies that can end poverty, spread prosperity, and protect the planet.
Those who act first will be the wiser – and wealthier – for it.

The Promise of Fiscal Money
ATHENS – Western capitalism has few sacred cows left.
It is time to question one of them: the independence of central banks from elected governments.
The rationale for entrusting monetary policy fully to central banks is well understood: politicians, overly tempted during the electoral cycle to create more money, pose a threat to economic stability.
While progressives have always protested that central banks can never be truly independent, because their autonomy from elected officials increases their dependence on the financiers they are meant to keep in check, the argument in favor of removing monetary policy from democratic politics has prevailed since the 1970s.
Setting aside the political controversy, central bank independence is predicated on an economic axiom: that money and debt (or credit) are strictly separable.
Debt – for example, a government or corporate bond that is bought and sold for a price that is a function of inflation and default risk – can be traded domestically.
Money, on the other hand, cannot default and is a means, rather than an object, of exchange (the currency market notwithstanding).
But this axiom no longer holds.
With the rise of financialization, commercial banks have become increasingly reliant on one another for short-term loans, mostly backed by government bonds, to finance their daily operations.
This liquidity acquires familiar properties: used as a means of exchange and as a store of value, it becomes a form of money.
And there’s the rub: as banks issue more inter-bank money, the financial system requires more government bonds to back the increase.
The growing inter-bank money supply fuels demand for government debt, in a never-ending cycle that generates tides of liquidity over which central banks have little control.
In this brave new financial world, central banks’ independence is becoming meaningless, because the money they create represents a shrinking share of the total money supply.
With the rise of inter-bank money, backed mostly by government debt, fiscal policy has become an essential factor in determining the quantity of actual money lubricating modern capitalism.
Indeed, the more independent a central bank is, the greater the role of fiscal policy in determining the quantity of money in an economy.
For example, in the eurozone, Germany’s tight fiscal policy is creating a shortage of bunds (German government bonds), which is limiting both the European Central Bank’s capacity to implement its quantitative easing policy and commercial banks’ ability to produce more inter-bank money.
Money and government debt are now so intertwined that the analytical basis for central bank autonomy has disappeared.
Of course, any attempt to bring treasuries and central banks back under one roof would expose politicians to accusations of trying to get their grubby hands on the levers of monetary policy.
But another response to the new reality is available: Leave central banks alone, but give governments a greater say in domestic money creation – and, indeed, greater independence from the central bank – by establishing a parallel payments system based on fiscal money or, more precisely, money backed by future taxes.
How would fiscal money work?
For starters, it would “live” on the tax authority’s digital platform, using the existing tax file numbers of individuals and companies.
Anyone with a tax file number (TFN) in some country receives a free account linked to their TFN.
Individuals and firms will then be able to add credit to their TFN-linked account by transferring money from their normal bank account, in the same way that they do today to pay their taxes.
And they will do so well in advance of tax payments because the state guarantees to extinguish in, say, a year €1,080 ($1,289) of the tax owed for every €1,000 transferred today – an effective annual interest rate of 8% payable to those willing to pay their taxes a year early.
In practice, once, say, €1,000 has been transferred to one’s TFN-linked account, a personal identification number (the familiar PIN) is issued, which can be used either to transfer the €1,000 credit to someone else’s TFN-linked account or to pay taxes in the future.
These time-stamped future tax euros, or fiscal euros, can be held for a year until maturity or be used to make payments to other taxpayers.
Smartphone apps and even government-issued cards (doubling as, say, social security ID) will make the transactions easy, fast, and virtually indistinguishable from other transactions involving central bank money.
In this closed payments system, as fiscal money approaches maturity, taxpayers not in possession of that vintage will fuel rising demand for it.
To ensure the system’s viability, the Treasury would control the total supply of fiscal money, using the effective interest rate to guarantee that the nominal value of the total supply never exceeds a percentage of national income, or of aggregate taxes, agreed by the legislature.
To ensure full transparency, and thus trust, a blockchain algorithm, designed and supervised by an independent national authority, could settle transactions in fiscal money.
The advantages of fiscal money are legion.
It would provide a source of liquidity for governments, bypassing the bond markets.
It would limit the extent to which government borrowing fuels inter-bank money creation, or at least force financiers to tie up some of their inter-bank money in the closed, domestic fiscal money system, thereby minimizing shocks from sudden capital flight.
And, by competing with the banks’ payment system, it would reduce the cost of fees customers currently pay.
Indeed, owing to the blockchain technology, fiscal money constitutes a fully transparent, transaction-cost-free, public payment system monitored jointly by every citizen (and non-citizen) who participates in it.
Fiscal money is politically attractive as well.
Governments could use any slack in money supply to top up the FTN-linked accounts of families in need, or to pay for public works, making it appealing to progressives.
And conservatives should be encouraged by a system that promises significant tax relief for those who help the government create fiscal money, without impinging on the central bank’s role in setting interest rates.
The potential transnational advantages of fiscal money are also significant.
For example, fiscal money would have helped Greece resist our creditors’ encroachments in 2015, and it was at the heart of my plan for dealing with a predatory bank holiday enforced by the ECB at the end of that June.
Today, it would give Italy, France, and other eurozone members much needed fiscal space, and possibly provide a foundation for a revamped eurozone with interlocking domestic fiscal euros, rather than parallel currencies, playing a stabilizing macroeconomic role.
And then, perhaps, it could become the basis for a New Bretton Woods, functioning like an overarching clearing union of many different fiscal money systems.

Poverty’s Cancer
GENEVA – Cancer is an enormous – and growing – global public-health problem.
And, of the 7.6 million cancer deaths every year, 4.8 million occur in the developing world.
A disease formerly considered more pervasive in affluent countries now places its heaviest burden on poor and disadvantaged populations.
In some African countries, fewer than 15% of cancer patients survive for five years following diagnosis of cervical and breast cancer, diseases that are highly curable elsewhere in the world.
These are shocking statistics, with huge implications for human suffering, health-care systems (and budgets), and the international drive to reduce poverty.
So they should be treated as a call to action.
The increase in cancer’s impact on the poor reflects factors such as demographic growth, population aging, the spread of unhealthy lifestyles (including tobacco use), and lack of control of cancer-associated infections.
Though many cancers develop slowly, lifestyle changes take place with stunning speed and reach.
These trends are not easily reversed.
If no action is taken, the number of cancer deaths in the developing world is forecast to grow to 5.9 million in 2015 and 9.1 million in 2030.
While cancer deaths in wealthy countries are expected to increase less dramatically, they are nonetheless predicted to rise by a harrowing 40% over the next 20 years.
Throughout the developing world, most health-care systems are designed to cope with episodes of infectious disease.
But most lack the funds, equipment, and qualified personnel needed to provide basic care for cancer patients.
Thirty countries – half of them in Africa – do not have a single radiotherapy machine.
And these countries certainly do not have the financial resources, facilities, equipment, technology, infrastructure, staff, or training to cope with the long-term demands of cancer care.
They also have little capacity for prevention, public education, or early diagnosis and treatment, whether it be early detection in primary care, surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.
In large parts of Africa, such treatments are usually reserved for those rich enough to seek specialized care abroad.
The demands of chronic care for a disease like cancer are simply overwhelming.
Countries and families also pay a huge economic cost, as the lives of millions of people who could otherwise have made productive contributions to their families and communities for many decades are cut short.
The real tragedy, of course, is that many of these patients do not have to die.
We know that around one-third of cancers can be prevented.
This figure could be increased markedly if more emphasis were placed on identifying additional environmental and lifestyle-associated factors that increase cancer risks.
In addition, a diagnosis no longer has to be a death sentence, because one-third of cancers can be cured if detected early and treated properly.
The World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency are working closely together to improve cancer control in developing countries.
The IAEA’s work involves building countries’ capacity for radiation medicine.
But technology means nothing without well-trained and motivated staff to use it.
That is why both organizations are developing training and mentoring networks and innovative public-private partnerships.
With its broad approach to public health, it is also essential to strengthen health-care systems and primary care in order to improve early detection, timely diagnosis and treatment, as well as palliative care.
Preventive measures such as public-health initiatives to curb smoking can be remarkably effective.
Vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomaviruses, if made available at affordable prices, could contribute significantly to the prevention of liver and cervical cancers, respectively.
At the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the specialized cancer agency of WHO, further research on the causes of cancer is being conducted, which promises to provide the base of evidence required to alleviate even more of the worldwide cancer burden,.
We are seeing promising results in individual countries, but our efforts are just a drop in a vast ocean of need.
In order to respond to the growing cancer epidemic, we need nothing less than concerted global action similar to the successful mobilization against HIV/AIDS.
Cancer should be acknowledged as a vital part of the global health agenda.
World leaders should be made aware of the scale of the cancer crisis facing developing countries.
We need systematic action at the highest level to end the deadly disparity in cancer survival rates between rich and poor countries, thereby helping to save millions of lives.
The goal must be to promote effective cancer control that is integrated into national health-care systems throughout the developing world.
The United Nations General Assembly’s Summit on Non-Communicable Diseases in September provides an opportunity to focus the world’s attention on cancer in developing countries.
Let us make cancer control one of the good news stories of 2011.

Big Banks’ Tall Tales
WASHINGTON, DC – There are two competing narratives about recent financial-reform efforts and the dangers that very large banks now pose around the world.
One narrative is wrong; the other is scary.
At the center of the first narrative, preferred by financial-sector executives, is the view that all necessary reforms have already been adopted (or soon will be).
Banks have less debt relative to their equity levels than they had in 2007.
New rules limiting the scope of bank activities are in place in the United States, and soon will become law in the United Kingdom – and continental Europe could follow suit.
Proponents of this view also claim that the megabanks are managing risk better than they did before the global financial crisis erupted in 2008.
In the second narrative, the world’s largest banks remain too big to manage and have strong incentives to engage in precisely the kind of excessive risk-taking that can bring down economies.
Last year’s “London Whale” trading losses at JPMorgan Chase are a case in point.
And, according to this narrative’s advocates, almost all big banks display symptoms of chronic mismanagement.
While the debate over megabanks sometimes sounds technical, in fact it is quite simple.
Ask this question: If a humongous financial institution gets into trouble, is this a big deal for economic growth, unemployment, and the like?
Or, more bluntly, could Citigroup or a similar-size European firm get into trouble and stumble again toward failure without attracting some form of government and central bank support (whether transparent or somewhat disguised)?
The US took a step in the right direction with Title II of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation in 2010, which strengthened the resolution powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And the FDIC has developed some plausible plans specifically for dealing with domestic financial firms.
(I serve on the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee; all views stated here are my own.)
But a great myth lurks at the heart of the financial industry’s argument that all is well.
The FDIC’s resolution powers will not work for large, complex cross-border financial enterprises. The reason is simple: US law can create a resolution authority that works only within national boundaries.
Addressing potential failure at a firm like Citigroup would require a cross-border agreement between governments and all responsible agencies.
On the fringes of the International Monetary Fund’s just-completed spring meetings in Washington, DC, I had the opportunity to talk with senior officials and their advisers from various countries, including from Europe.
I asked all of them the same question: When will we have a binding framework for cross-border resolution?
The answers typically ranged from “not in our lifetimes” to “never.”
Again, the reason is simple: countries do not want to compromise their sovereignty or tie their hands in any way.
Governments want the ability to decide how best to protect their countries’ perceived national interests when a crisis strikes.
No one is willing to sign a treaty or otherwise pre-commit in a binding way (least of all a majority of the US Senate, which must ratify such a treaty).
As Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, put it recently, using the delicate language of central bankers, “The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled.
This is necessary to eliminate the so-called ‘too big to fail’ problem.”
Translation: Orderly resolution of global megabanks is an illusion.
As long as we allow cross-border banks at or close to their current scale, our political leaders will be unable to tolerate their failure.
And, because these large financial institutions are by any meaningful definition “too big to fail,” they can borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case.
Worse, they have both motive and opportunity to grow even larger.
This form of government support amounts to a large implicit subsidy for big banks.
It is a bizarre form of subsidy, to be sure, but that does not make it any less damaging to the public interest.
On the contrary, because implicit government support for “too big to fail” banks rises with the amount of risk that they assume, this support may be among the most dangerous subsidies that the world has ever seen.
After all, more debt (relative to equity) means a higher payoff when things go well.
And, when things go badly, it becomes the taxpayers’ problem (or the problem of some foreign government and their taxpayers).
What other part of the corporate world has the ability to drive the global economy into recession, as banks did in the fall of 2008?
And who else has an incentive to maximize the amount of debt that they issue?
What the two narratives about financial reform have in common is that neither has a happy ending.
Either we put a meaningful cap on the size of our largest financial firms, or we must brace ourselves for the debt-fueled economic explosion to come.

A New Year of Global Conflict
DAVOS – In today’s world, identifying and managing hotspots is not simply a matter of pulling out a map, spotting the wildfires, and empowering diplomats to douse the flames.
To understand today’s major conflicts and confrontations, we must recognize important ways in which global political conditions enable them.
Conflicts are much more likely to arise or persist when those with the means to prevent or end them cannot or will not do so.
Unfortunately, this will be borne out in 2013.
In the United States, barring a foreign-policy crisis that directly threatens national security, President Barack Obama’s administration will focus most of its time, energy, and political capital on debt reduction and other domestic priorities.
In Europe, officials will continue their struggle to restore confidence in the eurozone.
And, in China, though the demands of economic growth and job creation will force the country’s new leaders to develop new ties to other regions, they are far too preoccupied with the complexities of economic reform to assume unnecessary costs and risks outside Asia.
That is why the world’s fires will burn longer and hotter this year.
This does not mean that the world’s powers will not inflict damage of their own. Today, these governments are more likely to use drones and special forces to strike at their perceived enemies.
The world has grown used to US drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, but recent news reports suggest that China and Japan are also investing in unmanned aircraft – in part to enhance their leverage in disputes over islands in the East China Sea.
By lowering the costs and risks of attack, these technological innovations make military action more likely.
Perhaps the lowest-cost way to undermine rivals and attack enemies is to launch attacks in cyberspace.
That is why so many deep-pocketed governments – and some that are not so rich – are investing heavily in the technology and skills needed to enhance this capability.
This form of warfare is especially worrisome for two reasons.
First, unlike the structure of Cold War-era “mutually assured destruction,” cyber weapons offer those who use them an opportunity to strike anonymously.
Second, constant changes in technology ensure that no government can know how much damage its cyber-weapons can do or how well its deterrence will work until they use them.
As a result, governments now probe one another’s defenses every day, increasing the risk of accidental hostilities.
If John Kerry and Chuck Hagel are confirmed as US secretaries of state and defense, respectively, the Obama administration will feature two prominent skeptics of military intervention.
But high levels of US investment in drones, cyber-tools, and other unconventional weaponry will most likely be maintained.
These technological advances create the backdrop for the competition and rivalries roiling the two most important geopolitical hotspots.
In the Middle East, US and European officials will continue to resist deeper involvement in regional turmoil this year, leaving local powers – Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia – to vie for influence.
Confrontations between moderates and militants, and between Sunni and Shia factions, are playing out in several North African and Middle Eastern countries.
US officials have reason to believe that, over time, they will be able to worry less about the region and its problems.
According to current projections, technological innovations in unconventional energy will allow the US to meet more than 80% of its oil demand from sources in North and South America by 2020.
China, on the other hand, is set to become more dependent on Middle Eastern output.
Meanwhile, East Asia will remain a potential trouble spot in 2013.
Many of China’s neighbors fear that its ongoing economic and military expansion poses a growing threat to their interests and independence, and are reaching out to the US to diversify their security partnerships and hedge their bets on China’s benign intentions.
The US, eager to boost its economy’s longer-term prospects by engaging new trade partners in the world’s fastest-growing region, is shifting resources to Asia – though US (and European) policymakers would be wise to move forward with a transatlantic free-trade agreement as well.
There is a growing risk that the new Chinese leadership will interpret a heavier US presence in the region as an attempt to contain China’s rise and stunt its growth.
We have already seen a series of worrisome confrontations in the region, pitting China against Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea, and against Japan in the East China Sea.
While these disputes are unlikely to provoke military hostilities this year, the use of drones and cyber weapons remains a real threat.
The greatest risk for 2013 is large-scale economic conflict in Asia, which would not only harm the countries directly involved, but would also undermine global recovery.
The first shots in this battle have already been fired.
Last summer, disputes over a string of contested islands in the East China Sea led to a furious exchange of charges between China and Japan, the world’s second- and third-largest economies, respectively.
The two sides were never in danger of going to war, but Chinese officials allowed nationalist protests to develop into boycotts of Japanese products and acts of vandalism against Japanese companies.
Japan’s automobile exports to China fell 44.5%, and China’s imports from Japan fell nearly 10% – all in just one month.
That was a tough hit for a struggling Japanese economy.
It is also a clear warning to the rest of us that a fight need not involve troops, tanks, and rockets to exact a heavy price.

The Great Escapism
NEW YORK – Barack Obama, however mixed his accomplishments to date as US president, has sought to rebrand America and reclaim its former signature asset: its ability to embody universally admired values. As popular culture is usually the way those values are transmitted, it is worth considering what it is about American cinema, music, and popular literature that makes them so compelling to many other parts of the world.
After all, much of what America once monopolized in Hollywood movies and other pop-culture exports is now being reproduced locally.
Bollywood competes with California in terms of glamorous stars and big production numbers; Japan and South Korea mint their own pop singers and fashion trends.
But consider Entourage, the American TV show that centers on a rising male film star and his posse of dudes. Or a recent article in The New Yorker about two scruffy young chefs who have set out across the country to start the great adventure of running their own crazy restaurant, called Animal.
Or Swingers, the 1996 worldwide hit movie about a twenty-something guy in Hollywood and his band of male friends who drag him to Las Vegas to mend his broken heart.
One of America’s last competitive cultural exports, it seems, is the post-adolescent male escape fantasy.
Ever since Huck Finn took his friends down the Mississippi River on a raft, American men have created and consumed fantasies of setting out with their males friends for parts unknown, or of traveling in an all-male group to have adventures closer to home.
In the 1950’s, Jack Kerouac took his buddy careening across the country in On the Road.
A decade later, Ken Kesey took his buddies, the Merry Pranksters, across the country in the other direction in their painted bus (granted, with female hangers-on).
From Easy Rider in the 1960’s to the Harold and Kumar movies today, the “buddy film” – typically involving travel-based adventure – has become an established genre.
Savvy American politicians even make use of it for their own purposes.
Both John McCain and George W. Bush cleverly tapped into this fantasy – with its easy bonhomie and absence of wives and kids – to capture the hearts of the male journalists aboard their campaign buses, who could imagine themselves once again as tough, unfettered, and venturesome Kerouac figures.
President Obama even gave the actor who played Kumar a job in the White House (which he has now left to return to Hollywood).
As you survey the rest of global culture, the male-escape scenario is hard to spot emerging from any other place.
Save for the recent hit film 3 Idiots, Bollywood doesn’t send groups of Indian guys off on merry, irresponsible adventures.
Male protagonists in French films don’t take off together in convertibles for the Pyrenees; they stay home and urbanely have affairs.
Nor does Japanese pop culture manufacture escape fantasies aimed at Japanese men.
Yet men all over the world tune in to American-made fantasies of male bonding and male escape – escape from the bonds of work and domesticity, and, if only for a youthful period of the male lifespan, from long-term commitment to women themselves.
This fantasy, derived, no doubt, from American history – from westward expansion and Manifest Destiny, from the Gold Rush and a settlement policy that valorized staking a claim to the wilderness and subduing it – is powerfully appealing to men in general, and to many women as well.
Indeed, American women have recently begun to film and export their own versions of this fantasy – starting with the groundbreaking 1991 film Thelma and Louise and continuing in a growing trend of girl-group travel and escape packages.
Other countries’ lack of male escape fantasies in their popular culture may be no less historically rooted: less transient, more traditional societies will not warmly welcome homegrown films and pop songs about local young men taking off and fleeing their responsibilities.
But, judging by the appetite shown worldwide for this narrative, it seems clear that identification with such adventures is almost universal.
It seems to speak to a deep longing in men – and in the women who also enjoy these films and TV shows – for a time in one’s life when one could dash toward freedom, adventure, and self-reinvention, unencumbered by social ties and family obligations.
At its best, this genre is part of America’s gift to the rest of the world.
At its worst, it is part of America’s curse.
That whiff of careening, heedless adolescent fecklessness is part of what makes the archetypal American male presence alarming when he is equipped with a global cudgel.
To the rest of the world, those same qualities are part of his charm only so long as he stays safely up on the screen.

Getting Investment in Europe Right
PARIS – The European Commission’s new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has put public investment back on the agenda with his idea of a three-year €300 billion ($378 billion) capital spending plan.
The European Union’s leaders are expected to discuss his proposal in December.
Everyone seems to agree that more investment would help to strengthen a worryingly feeble European economy.
But, behind the superficial consensus, many questions remain unanswered.
For starters, this is not the first time that Europe has considered such an initiative.
In 1993, the Commission, under Jacques Delors, proposed a capital spending plan in its White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment.
The plan was broadly endorsed, but no action was taken.
Likewise, in 2000, as part of its Lisbon Strategy, the EU sought to increase national spending on research and development to 3% of GDP.
It failed to reach this target.
More recently, in June 2012, EU leaders adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs that was supposed to mobilize €120 billion.
The check is still in the mail.
It is indeed easy to pretend to act without taking effective action.
One way is to ask the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU’s development bank, to lend more.
Such calls face two limitations: the EIB itself is careful not to jeopardize its financial rating by taking on too much risk, and its loans easily substitute for private financing.
More lending therefore can be pointless if it results in the EIB crowding out private financing of the best available projects.
A bridge financed by the EIB may be more affordable than one financed by capital markets, but it remains the same bridge and has the same economic impact.
The size of the EIB’s balance sheet is not a good measure of its effectiveness.
Instead, three investment levers should be used.
The first lever is budgetary: Governments that enjoy fiscal space should spend on economically sound projects.
Public investment is a complement to private investment; if designed and targeted well, it can trigger more private investment, rather than crowding it out.
For example, adequate transport and broadband infrastructure favors the burgeoning of business initiatives.
At a time when markets are willing to lend to solvent governments at historically low rates, there should be little room for hesitation.
Obviously, cheap financing does not justify public investment in projects with dubious social returns, or what development practitioners call “white elephants”: headline-grabbing projects of disputable value but supported by special interests.
Investments should be assessed on the basis of their overall economic impact, with proper procedures put in place to prevent public money from being wasted.
The second lever for investment is regulatory in nature. Many large-scale investments that only pay off over the long term – for example, in energy, digital infrastructure, and transport – are concentrated in state-regulated sectors, giving governments the power to influence business decisions.
Predictability regarding the future course of regulation would unlock projects held back by uncertainty.
A credible outlook for the price of carbon, for example, would prompt new private-sector investment in cleaner technologies.
Similarly, an agreed European framework for projects that connect countries would remove obstacles to cross-border investment.
These conditions are a long way from being met, which means that profitable investments are not being made.
Changing that would not cost a single euro; it requires only political resolve.
The third lever is financial. Investment demand has slackened not because interest rates are too high, but because there is not enough risk appetite within the banking system.
Financing in continental Europe is traditionally bank-based, unlike in the US, where capital markets reign supreme.
But banks are being told by regulators to reduce their leverage and to post higher capital when they embark on risky lending, and their creditors are being told that they should not expect to be bailed out if banks get into trouble.
This is intentional.
Governments and citizens in Europe have paid – and are still paying – an astronomically high price for the reckless lending and investment of the 2000s.
Understandably, they do not want to repeat the experience.
The consequence, however, is that high-risk, high-return projects are more difficult to finance than they should be.
If Europe wants to revive its economy and escape stagnation, it needs entrepreneurs to take more risk to innovate.
But its financial system is undergoing a transition from a bank-based to a market-based system that involves risk aversion.
This is where the public side – both national governments and the EU – should step in and share some of the risk with private players.
They should temporarily behave more like investors who scrutinize projects, contribute funding, and earn returns.
Using the EIB and national development banks to this end would help overcome the current impasse.
Would these three types of initiatives add up to €300 billion?
No one knows at this stage.
But this route would be the surest way to reach the goal.

Arab Fathers and Sons
The deaths of Yasir Arafat and of Sheikh Zayd, the long-standing ruler of the United Arab Emirates, continues the generational change that began in 1999-2000, when the leaders of Jordan, Morocco, Bahrain, and Syria died in quick succession.
Across the Middle East people are younger, and their political leaders older, than the world average.
The gradual replacement of one generation of elites by another may be one of the key factors in determining whether or not effective reform takes place in the Arab world.
At present, four political generations co-exist on the region’s socio-political map.
The outgoing leadership generation – that of Arafat, King Hussein or Hafiz al-Assad, King Fahd and President Mubarak – was born before 1935 and has determined events in the Middle East since the 1970’s.
These leaders came of age and began their careers during the era of decolonization.
They were weaned on Gamal Abdel-Nasser’s pan-Arab nationalism, and the crucial political event for them was the Arab defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Members of this generation sought a strong Arab leadership that would create a balance of power with Israel.
They also believed in – or at least toyed with – forms of socialism and étatism, and did not consider democracy or civil rights to be priorities.
The next generation was born between 1935 and 1955, and in many respects represents a generation “in between.”
Most benefited from the economic growth and expanded educational opportunities associated with the oil boom of the 1970’s.
At the same time, political participation remained blocked by the previous generation, which never intended to give up power voluntarily.
Unsurprisingly, many in this generation grew dissatisfied, and not a few began to look for Islamic alternatives to the prevailing political systems.
Rather than determining events in the coming two or three decades, this generation is likely to be sidelined by the next cohort, born between 1955 and 1975.
This is the generation of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, Jordan’s King Abdullah and Morocco’s King Muhammad VI. Some call this the “generation of sons” – sons of leaders who led their states for decades.
This age cohort was not much influenced by the Arab-Israeli wars or the East-West conflict. Instead, their political education included the Gulf War of 1991 and the Arab-Israeli peace process of the 1990’s, with its crises and breakdown.
Jailed West Bank Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti is as representative of this group as the leaders of Syria and Jordan.
Members of this generation are better acquainted with notions of globalization and economic reform than with socialism and revolution.
Except for the Palestinians, they have never known their countries other than as independent and comparatively stable states.
In the Palestinian territories, the jil al-intifada , the generation of the (first and second) Palestinian uprising, will likely become the founding generation.
But it is the fourth group that underscores the relevance of generational issues in the Arab world.
Even when combined, the first three generations make up barely one-third of the entire Arab population.
Almost 60% of all Arabs are younger than 20, with roughly 70% below the age of 30.
This raises a key question: what happens to these Arab “baby boomers” if the generation now coming to power clings to it as tenaciously as the generation of Mubarak, Assad, and Hussein?
The political generation of Bashar al-Assad, King Abdullah, and Gamal Mubarak – son of Egypt’s ailing president – forms a less coherent picture than that of the outgoing leadership.
In that elder generation, many had pursued military careers, and many of their aides and collaborators were engineers and civil servants.
The socio-professional profile of the new elite is broader.
Economists, bankers, and entrepreneurs as well as of technology or communication experts are common.
There are also more traditional politicians: personalities who see themselves as representatives of particular social or economic interests, not as apolitical technocrats.
This new leadership elite is in many ways more cosmopolitan than its predecessors; their average level of education is higher; a few have foreign degrees.
Women also play a somewhat greater role.
Developments in Morocco, Bahrain, and Jordan certainly seem to suggest that this changing of the guard can help soften rigid political structures and allow for broader participation.
But generational change need not be accompanied by economic reform and steps towards political liberalization – witness North Korea under Kim Il Sung’s son, Kim Jong Il.
Indeed, experience gives little reason to presume that a modern way of speaking, willingness to liberalize the economy, and an urge for technological development automatically translates into a democratic opening.
It is more realistic to expect that the new Arab elites will make use of their states’ authoritarian institutions, both to overcome resistance to their economic agendas and to consolidate their newly acquired power.
This is anything but a risk-free path.
Without a significant increase in opportunities for political participation, including genuinely competitive elections, the chasm between a predominantly young population and a ruling elite with a narrow generational base will widen.
Such continuing political inertia leaves an increasingly young Arab population prey to the appeal of extremist ideologies, while driving the best and brightest to seek their fortune elsewhere.

Downside Risks to Global Growth
NEW HAVEN – The predictable downward revision cycle for the global economic outlook has officially begun.
That’s the message from the semi-annual World Economic Outlook just released by the International Monetary Fund, which reinforces earlier revisions from several prominent private forecasting teams.
The revision, largely in response to the war in Ukraine, is a big one – a sharp reduction in world economic growth to 3.6% for 2022, fully 1.3 percentage points below the IMF’s global growth forecast of 4.9% made just six months earlier.
To its credit, the IMF warned that this was coming, with an interim downward revision of 0.5 percentage point previously released in January.
Even so, in looking back over the past 15 years, this is the third-largest cut in the IMF’s regular six-month revision cycle.
In April 2009, as the global financial crisis (GFC) was unfolding, the IMF cut its global growth estimate for the year by 4.3 percentage points (taking its pre-crisis projection of 3% positive growth down to an outright contraction of -1.3%).
And, of course, as the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in early 2020, the IMF slashed its growth estimate for the year by 6.4 percentage points (from a pre-pandemic projection of +3.4% to an outright contraction of -3%).
In both of those earlier cases, the outsize forecast reductions foretold sharp global recessions – in fact, the two worst recessions in modern history.
Yet neither the IMF nor most other forecasters believe that the current shortfall in global growth will push the world into outright recession.
The latest World Economic Outlook calls for a perfect soft landing in the $96 trillion global economy.
Following the recent downward revision, global growth is now expected to settle comfortably into a 3.6% growth trajectory over 2022-23, which is fractionally above the 3.4% average since 1980.
Landings don’t get much smoother than that.
But that could well be wishful thinking, for several reasons.
For starters, forecasters were overly optimistic in extrapolating the sugar high of 2021 into the future.
The 6.1% surge of global growth in 2021 was the sharpest rebound on record, according to IMF statistics dating back to 1980.
But this followed the steepest plunge on record, a -3.1% collapse in 2020.
Just as COVID lockdowns brought the bulk of the global economy to a virtual standstill in early 2020, reopening, in conjunction with aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus, produced the mother of all snapbacks.
Forecasters are an autoregressive species, with an uncanny knack of extrapolating the latest trend into the future. The same is true of investors.
For that reason, alone, it is important to look through the extraordinary volatility of 2020-21 to get a clean read on which trend to extrapolate. Over those two years, global GDP growth averaged just 1.5%, well below the official global recession threshold, widely thought to be around 2.5%.
Needless to say, if world economic growth slows more toward that underlying trend than the soft-landing glide path, another global recession is hardly farfetched.
A second reason to doubt buoyant forecasts is that the China cushion has been deflated.
China’s economy is currently growing well below the nearly 8% pace recorded from 2010 to 2019.
The latest IMF outlook puts average Chinese growth in 2022-23 at 4.75%, only a little more than half the post-GFC trend when strong Chinese growth was literally the only thing that prevented the world from relapsing into recession over the 2012-16 period.
As was the case back then, global resilience without a more vigorous Chinese economy is highly unlikely.
That’s the risk today.
With China currently facing a trifecta of shocks – a new wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, the ongoing pressures of deleveraging (especially in its unstable property sector), and war-related collateral damage resulting from its ill-advised partnership with Russia – the world economy can no longer rely on China as a source of resilience.
That, of course, cuts both ways.
If China deepens its commitment to Russia, it will share in the isolation of its “unlimited partner.”
For a Chinese economy that remains deeply reliant on the rest of the world, that could prove to be President Xi Jinping’s greatest challenge.
Third, the downshift in the global growth cycle is being accompanied by a major upswing in the global inflation and interest-rate cycles.
The soft-landing crowd is dismissive of the consequences.
As inflation surges to 40-year highs, there is loose talk of “peak inflation” – the fanciful idea that it is so bad now that it can only get better from here.
This superficial arithmetic argument misses the point.
With the US Consumer Price Index surging by 8.5% in March, there is of course an excellent chance that this key barometer of inflation will be considerably lower by year end.
But how much lower?
Low enough to rescue the US Federal Reserve from its most irresponsible monetary-policy gambit since the mid-1970s and early 1980s?
Don’t count on it.
While the Fed is now talking tough, talk is cheap.
So far, it has delivered only 25 basis points, or just 10%, of the some 250 basis points of cumulative tightening that financial markets are expecting over the next six months.
Even if the Fed moves as expected and boosts the federal funds rate to 2.5% by this November, the nominal policy rate is likely to be well below the inflation rate.
That means the real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate will remain in negative territory throughout the year, marking a 38-month period of negative real policy rates – far more stimulus than in earlier periods of über-accommodation under Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen.
Real interest rates matter in maintaining price stability and driving economic growth.
When assessing risks to the global business cycle, the bottom line is that the upswing in real rates has much further to go.
All of this underscores the downside risks that are building in the global economy.
As a recovering Wall Street forecaster, I empathize with the mindset of most forecasting teams, including the IMF’s highly talented professionals, who believe that they have factored in most conceivable risks.
In this case, financial markets concur, convinced that an inflation-prone world, with still jaw-droppingly accommodative central banks, is somehow gliding gloriously toward a soft landing for the ages.
But is this already-rosy scenario really supposed to play out without China?
Dream on.

To Impeach, or Not to Impeach
WASHINGTON, DC – As the US Congress returns from a ten-day break, the question of whether the House of Representatives (controlled by the Democrats) should formally commence the process of impeaching President Donald Trump for misdeeds committed during his tenure – and perhaps before – has split the party.
Theoretically, impeachment by the House would be followed by a trial in the Senate.
But the Senate, controlled by the Republicans, is considered highly unlikely to convict their party’s standard-bearer, unless some stunning new revelation about his actions turns up – which cannot be ruled out.
For all the press attention devoted to the growing number of House Democrats who favor initiating an impeachment process now, the total (now over 50) represents only about one-fifth of the party’s House membership.
And Republican representatives are so loyal to Trump – or so afraid of facing a primary challenge in 2020 – that only one, Justin Amash of Michigan, a strict libertarian, supports impeachment, though other Republicans privately would be glad to see Trump gone.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi claims to oppose impeachment, at least for now, but leaves the question partly open by saying things such as, “We’re not there yet.”
To impeach Trump, she says, would be bad politics for her party, because it would firm up Republican support for him and further divide the country.
Launching an impeachment process now, she fears, would undermine her main goals: to avoid jeopardizing the Democrats’ hard-won control of the House and to maximize the party’s chances in the presidential election next year.
In fact, Pelosi, and other party leaders, have been saying they would prefer that the issue be litigated in the 2020 presidential election.
They believe, with good reason, that the Democratic Party did so well in the House in the 2018 midterm elections because its candidates emphasized issues of immediate interest to voters – such as health-care coverage and costs.
And yet now the House Majority whip, James Clyburn, has said that he believes Trump will be impeached “at some point.”
Like Pelosi, Clyburn believes that a strong case must be made before any action is taken.
Hearings planned by several House committees are supposed to establish that case.
(Trump hasn’t helped himself by trying to block these committees’ access to documents and testimony by even former aides.
So far, courts have ruled in House Democrats’ favor.)
While Pelosi is widely considered one of the smartest strategists in Washington, there are problems with her stated position.
No one can foresee now the political fallout from an impeachment of Trump, and the Constitution, which established the impeachment process as a check on the president’s behavior between elections, says nothing about using it only when politically convenient.
Moreover, given the results in 2018, Democratic Party leaders might well discourage making the disposition of the president the key issue in the next election.
Most important, a decision not to initiate an impeachment process against Trump could set a terrible precedent.
If Trump isn’t impeached for his numerous criminal acts and abuses of power, would impeachment remain a viable check on the presidency?
Pelosi has appeared unconcerned with that question.
To discourage her Democratic House colleagues from advocating impeachment, Pelosi warns that Trump wants to be impeached, because he thinks it would play to his political advantage.
But it’s not at all clear that this is so.
No president welcomes the scar of having been impeached.
Trump refers to “the I-word,” which he described last week as “a dirty, filthy, disgusting word.”
Moreover, impeachment isn’t about politics, but about constitutional principles.
Trump is reported to have become very upset when now-former special counsel Robert Mueller broke his long silence last Wednesday to announce his resignation and say, “If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” (Mueller, highly and properly reluctant to go beyond what his report says, and disinclined to subject himself to a partisan circus, is now resisting bipartisan demands that he appear – at least in public – before a Congressional committee.)
But others see a high value in simply having Mueller express in front of television cameras what his 448-page report says.
Trump has been portraying the report’s findings as completely exonerating him (“no collusion, no obstruction”), even though the report explicitly stated that this was not the case.
Worse for Trump, the widely admired Mueller in effect recommended that Congress undertake an impeachment process.
Mueller explained that a controversial Justice Department policy, intended to help President Richard Nixon, bars the indictment of a sitting president.
This isn’t in the Constitution, nor is it a law.
(Nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate burglary cover-up, whereas Trump is one in New York case involving his participation in pre-election payoffs to silence two women with whom he had sexual liaisons shortly after the birth of his son Barron.)
Since shortly after the report was released in mid-April, Mueller and US Attorney General William Barr, formerly colleagues and friends, have engaged in a polite but fierce argument over the findings of the investigation.
Barr, once a Republican establishment lawyer who has been unusually outspoken for an attorney general in defending the president, has insisted on defining the report’s main conclusions, which he has consistently misinterpreted, to Mueller’s displeasure.
Trump ignores Mueller’s unambiguous conclusion – consistent with that of the entire US intelligence community – that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf.
Obviously, to accept this would undermine the legitimacy of his Electoral College victory.
It has been reported that top security officials were told not even to broach the subject of Russia’s involvement in front of Trump.
This makes it highly unlikely that Trump will support any real attempt to ward off similar electoral interference – possibly more intense and by more countries – in 2020.
He may even welcome foreign meddling.
FBI director Christopher Wray – one of the few officials to counter Trump publicly (it would be awkward for Trump to fire a second FBI director) – has said that Russia was active in the 2018 midterms and is likely to step up its efforts in the 2020 contest.
Assuming that Trump is still in office then, the next presidential election could well be dirtier and uglier than ever before.

Why Populists Don’t Concede
PRINCETON – In the run-up to Brazil’s presidential election next month, President Jair Bolsonaro is crafting his own version of former US President Donald Trump’s “Big Lie”: the claim that a loss at the ballot box is fraudulent.
Incumbents who adopt this tactic might simply refuse to concede, while still leaving quietly.
Or, more dangerously, they can foment outrage and even incite violence by their supporters.
It is no surprise that Bolsonaro, dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics,” would emulate Trump in this respect.
Trump has demonstrated how an electoral loser can remain a powerful – even domineering – force in a country’s politics.
But accepting the results of elections is one of the most basic elements of democracy.
If election denial is becoming a new global trend, we must ask why so many citizens would accept leaders who fraudulently cry “fraud.”
Bolsonaro is facing Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (better known as Lula), a left-wing former president who remains very popular, as demonstrated by his large and consistent lead in opinion polls.
While the gap could still narrow, the far-right Bolsonaro is expected to lose.
But he has spent years priming his supporters not to accept that outcome.
Most ominously, Bolsonaro has sown doubt about Brazil’s electronic voting system, which has been used since 2000 and is widely considered reliable and efficient.
After the January 6, 2021, insurrection in Washington, DC, he warned, “If we don’t have the ballot printed in 2022, a way to audit the votes, we’re going to have bigger problems than the US.” His politician son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has approvingly observed that if only the US Capitol insurrectionists had been better organized and armed, they would have succeeded.
In fact, populist losers are more likely than not to cry fraud, because the entire basis of their appeal lies in the claim that they, and only they, represent “the real people” (or “the silent majority”).
It follows that all other contenders for power are corrupt, and that citizens who do not support the populist leader do not truly belong to the people at all and hence are not casting legitimate votes.
Populism is not just about criticizing elites (which is often justified).
Rather, it is a fundamentally anti-pluralist stance: populists purport to be the uniquely authoritative voice of a completely homogeneous people that they themselves have conjured up.
According to this logic, if populists are the only authentic representatives of the people, an election loss must mean that someone (“liberal elites”) did something (“rigged the vote”) to thwart the will of the supposed majority.
For example, after his party unexpectedly lost the 2002 general election, Hungary’s current prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that “the homeland cannot be in opposition.”
And after his failed bid for the Mexican presidency in 2006, Mexico’s current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, announced that “the victory of the right is morally impossible.”
After rallying “the real people” (that is, his own supporters) in the streets of Mexico City, he then declared himself the “legitimate president of Mexico.”
It is important to recognize how populist rhetoric erodes a country’s democratic political culture even when elections do not lead to January 6-style insurrections.
Populist politicians are indoctrinating their supporters never to trust the system, and always to assume that elites are manipulating outcomes behind the scenes.
This is not to suggest that electoral laws and processes are above reproach.
In the United States, especially, one can criticize everything from campaign-finance regulations to the practical difficulties citizens face when trying to vote (many of which are the result of laws intended to make voting more difficult).
But there is a difference between criticizing undemocratic features of the system and declaring the entire enterprise undemocratic simply because you lost.
The former could well strengthen democracy, whereas the latter is intended only to undermine it.
Election denial becomes more likely when an electorate is polarized, because this creates opportunities for political entrepreneurs like Trump and Bolsonaro, neither of whom has ever been tethered to a political party.
Bolsonaro has kept changing parties, and, for two years of his presidency, had no party at all; and while Trump now dominates the Republican Party, he has never shown any loyalty to it (he used to be a Democrat).
Both men have built up cult-like followings through social media, thereby dispensing with the need for a proper party apparatus, which used to be essential for any serious political mobilization.
Absent properly functioning parties, neither man faces anyone from the same political camp who can restrain him; and neither has an actual governing philosophy or policy program.
Both essentially stand for endless, personality-led culture war; if they had a party program they actually cared about, they might be willing to step aside for intraparty rivals more likely to win future elections and hence able to implement the program.
Such figures can be expected to go for broke and deny what they know to be an actual loss.
Far more consequential is how others act.
Trump has succeeded in making endorsement of the Big Lie a litmus test for being a real Republican.
Accordingly, a slew of Republican congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial candidates refuse to say whether they will concede an election loss this November.
In Brazil, Bolsonarismo remains a minority position; but its protagonist has been maneuvering to get the military on his side, and he enjoys significant support among the police.
What populists present as “the silent majority” is often a loud minority, as in the case of both Trumpists and Bolsonaristas.
And while minorities have every right to make themselves heard, it is incumbent on the actual majority not to remain silent when a minority becomes anti-democratic and violent.

How the IMF Failed Greece
NEW DELHI – Democracy is about real choices.
But, throughout their country’s crisis, the Greek people have been deprived of them.
For this, the Europe Union and especially the International Monetary Fund bear considerable responsibility.
Greece was offered two stark choices: Leave the eurozone without financing, or remain and receive support at the price of further austerity.
But Greece should have been offered a third option: Leave the euro, but with generous financing.
This option should have been put on the table, recognizing that Greece has broader political reasons for staying within the eurozone.
Although exiting the monetary union would have yielded considerable benefits, “Grexit” would have entailed sizeable costs as well.
The benefits would have included a massive devaluation, which would have restored some dynamism to what was once a fast-growing economy.
But the costs were terrifying.
The government would have had to default, the banks would have been ruined, and both would have struggled for years to regain the trust of financial markets.
As a result, interest rates would have remained high for a long time to come, impeding efforts to restore growth.
Is it any wonder that the Greek government shrank from this horror and chose the “safe” option of austerity?
But this option may not be safe at all.
It is in fact, to quote T.S. Eliot, that “awful daring of a moment’s surrender...”
Greece will now need to grind away at austerity, hoping that in some distant future “internal devaluation” – that is, wage and price deflation – will help to spark a recovery.
Only the IMF could have offered the third option of an orderly exit.
Greece should have been told that it could reap the benefits of devaluation, while the international community would act to minimize the attendant costs.
The precise terms of Grexit – agreed by the troika (the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank) and Greek authorities – surely would have included a negotiated reduction in Greece’s debts, as well as a strategy for recapitalizing the banking system in order minimize uncertainty, pain, and disruption.
Still, the costs would have been sizeable, so the IMF would have needed to offer generous financing, covering the country’s import requirements for, say, two years while providing the liquidity to manage the transition to a new currency.
Of course, this would have increased the IMF’s already-large exposure to Greece; but this would have been a worthwhile trade-off, because it would have served a strategy that would have had a much better chance of success.
But is there any strategy that could have succeeded in restoring the Greek economy?
After all, under any scenario, Greece will need to run a primary surplus and undertake structural reforms to transform its economy.
And many insist that this will not happen, because Greece simply refuses to change.
And yet such assessments overlook the record of the past few years, during which successive governments have taken some fairly radical measures to strengthen Greece’s fiscal position and scale back the public payroll.
Moreover, the skeptics overlook the fact that incentives to carry out structural reforms are partly endogenous.
After all, without devaluation and the prospect of debt relief, reform merely spells more short-term pain, not less.
The reason why an assisted Grexit was never offered seems clear: Greece’s European creditors were vehemently opposed to the idea.
But it is not clear that the IMF should have placed great weight on these concerns.
Back in 2010, creditor countries were concerned about contagion to the rest of the eurozone.
If Grexit had succeeded, the entire monetary union would have come under threat, because investors would have wondered whether some of the eurozone’s other highly indebted countries would have followed Greece’s lead.
But this risk is actually another argument in favor of providing Greece with the option of leaving.
There is something deeply unappealing about yoking countries together when being unyoked is more advantageous.
More recently, creditor countries have been concerned about the financial costs to member governments that have lent to Greece.
But Latin America in the 1980s showed that creditor countries stand a better chance of being repaid (in expected-value terms) when the debtor countries are actually able to grow.
In short, the IMF should not have made Europe’s concerns, about contagion or debt repayment, decisive in its decision-making.
Instead, it should have publicly pushed for the third option, which would have been a watershed, for it would have signaled that the IMF will not be driven by its powerful members to acquiesce in bad policies.
Indeed, it would have afforded the Fund an opportunity to atone for its complicity in the creditor-driven, austerity-addled misery to which Greeks have been subject for the last five years.
Above all, it would have enabled the IMF to move beyond being the instrument of status quo powers – the United States and Europe.
From an Asian perspective, by defying its European shareholders, the IMF would have gone a long way toward heralding the emergence of a new institution: a truly International Monetary Fund, in place of today’s Euro-Atlantic Monetary Fund.
All is not lost.
If the current strategy fails, the third option – assisted Grexit – remains available.
The IMF should plan for it.
The Greek people deserve some real choices in the near future.

The UK’s Electoral System Failed
NEW YORK – On the most important issue in the United Kingdom’s modern history – whether to leave the European Union or remain – the UK’s electoral system produced an absurd result.
A majority of the UK public wants to remain in the EU, and actually voted accordingly in the parliamentary election on December 12.
Yet the election produced a large majority for the Conservative Party, which backs a quick Brexit.
The reason is as simple as it is troubling: the failure of the first-past-the-post electoral systems to translate public sentiment into reasonably representative outcomes.
In a first-past-the-post electoral system, each legislative seat goes to the candidate who wins the largest share of the vote, regardless of whether it is a majority.
Thus, when majority opinion is divided among several parties, the minority view prevails with a minority of votes.
As a simple illustration, suppose that there are three parties: Remain-1, Remain-2, and Leave.
Suppose that in every district, 66% of the public wants to remain and 34% wants to leave, with the remain voters divided evenly between the two remain parties.
Remain-1 and Remain-2 each receive 33% of the vote in every district, while the Leave Party wins the district seat with 34%.
If this result is replicated across all districts, the Leave Party wins 100% of the seats with 34% of the national vote.
In a nationwide proportional-representation system, by contrast, the Remain parties would win 66% of the seats and would form the government.
Of course, the actual situation in the UK is more nuanced.
Brexit was not the only campaign issue, and 11 parties, not just three, received at least 0.4% of the national vote.
Of those 11 parties, eight – Labour, the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats, Sinn Féin, Plaid Cymru, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Green Party, and Alliance (APNI) – campaigned either for a second Brexit referendum (a “people’s vote”) or for remaining in the EU.
Three of the 11 parties campaigned for Brexit without a second referendum: the Conservatives, the Democratic Unionist Party, and the Brexit Party.
In total, the 11 parties received 98.6% of the vote, with dozens of smaller parties accounting for the remaining 1.4%.
The eight parties campaigning to remain or hold a second referendum received 52.2% of the vote, while the three parties campaigning for Brexit with no second referendum received 46.4% of the vote.
Yet, the three pro-Brexit parties took 373 seats, compared to just 277 seats for the parties seeking to remain or hold a second referendum.
There are two reasons for this outcome.
First, the Brexit vote was nearly all concentrated in one party, the Conservatives, which received 94% of the combined Brexit vote.
Labour, by contrast, won only 61% of the vote among the eight parties opposed to Brexit or calling for a second referendum.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson united the Brexiteers.
Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, splintered the Remainers.
The second reason is that, under first-past-the-post, the overwhelming majorities (70% or higher) secured by Remainers in some districts – for example, London and Scotland – amounted essentially to wasted votes; the party still won just one seat.
In a proportional-representation system, those votes would count toward the party shares at the national level.
Last week’s vote shares were in line with recent public opinion surveys on Brexit.
In a particularly telling poll, carried out just before the election, Remainers outnumbered Leavers, 53% to 47%.
A majority of voters want to remain, yet the electoral system produced an overwhelming parliamentary majority for leave.
The UK is one of only a handful of high-income democracies – including the United States and Canada (as bequeathed by the UK) – with a first-past-the-post system.
If the UK had a national proportional vote system, as almost all of continental Europe does, it would be heading for a second Brexit referendum and staying in the EU.
The election results would probably have produced a multi-party coalition government against a quick Brexit.
Another glaring problem, less easily solved, is that young people overwhelmingly want to remain in the EU, while older people want to leave.
Older voters are imposing a future on young people who do not want it, but who will most likely have to deal with the consequences for the rest of their lives.
First-past-the-post voting has been praised for promoting political stability by producing two-party or nearly two-party systems.
Britain’s two main parties received 76% of the vote and will have 87% of the seats in the next Parliament.
Yet the stability is illusory.
It comes at the price of a government in which a minority can ride roughshod over the interests and preferences of more than half of the population.
When that happens, society becomes politically polarized.
In continental Europe, most governments are multi-party coalitions.
They can be difficult to form, cumbersome to maintain, and slow to act.
Yet the very process of multi-party coalition building prevents a minority from walking away with the political prize against the wishes of a large part of the population.
The situation is even more dangerous in the US, where presidential elections install a powerful executive who dominates a two-party legislature.
This is a triply cursed system.
First, the two parties do a poor job of representing public opinion, not least because of the plutocratic funding of US congressional campaigns.
Second, excessive power is vested in the hands of a single individual.
And third, because of the peculiarities of the Electoral College, the president can win with fewer votes than the opponent – as has occurred in two of the last five presidential elections.
In 2016, Donald Trump won 57% of the electoral votes, despite receiving 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.
As I have written previously, and as the UK’s recent election confirms, the two main Anglo-Saxon democracies are failing.
But they are failing not only because of a polarized electorate, but also because of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which produces governments that do not represent public sentiment well.

Built to Bust
BERKELEY – In the mid-2000’s, the United States had a construction boom.
From 2003-2006, annual construction spending rose to a level well above its long-run trend.
Thus, by the start of 2007, the US was, in essence, overbuilt: about $300 billion in excess of the long-run trend in construction spending.
When these buildings were constructed, they were expected to more than pay for themselves.
But their profitability depended on two shaky foundations: a permanent fall in long-term risky real interest rates, and permanent optimism about real estate as an asset class.
Both foundations collapsed.
By 2007, therefore, it was reasonable to expect that construction spending in the US would be depressed for some time to come.
Since cumulative construction spending was $300 billion above trend, it would have to run $300 billion below trend over a number of years in order to return to balance.
So, in 2007, everyone expected a construction-led slowdown.
And, starting that year, construction spending did indeed fall below trend.
But we were expecting a minor decline: a fall in construction spending below trend of $150 billion a year for two years or $100 billion a year for three years or $75 billion a year for four years.
Instead, spending fell $300 billion below trend in 2007 alone, and has remained depressed for four years.
Moreover, there is no prospect of anything like a rapid return to normal levels.
Therefore, when this construction cycle has run its course, the US will first have spent an excess $300 billion, and then fallen short of trend by a cumulative $2 trillion of spending not undertaken.
The net effect will be a construction shortfall in the US of at least $1.7 trillion.
That is a lot of unbuilt houses, apartment buildings, offices, and stores – and it is a truly radical disconnect between the size of the recent construction boom and the size of the current construction bust.
Indeed, this radical disproportion makes nonsense of all arguments that the current distressed state of the overall US economy is in some sense necessary, deserved, or an inevitable consequence of over-exuberant building in the desert between Los Angeles, California and Albuquerque, New Mexico in the mid-2000’s.
Otherwise, the construction-led economic slowdown would not be today’s $1 trillion in annual lost production.
The slowdown would be one-tenth the size of the one the US is now enduring, and it would be largely confined to the construction sector.
And, in that alternative universe, having worked off the entire burden of overbuilding, we would by now have returned to trend levels of production, employment, and demand.
There is one silver lining as we contemplate our macroeconomic wreckage: when incomes, production, and employment in the US return to their trend levels, Americans will demand an extra $1.7 trillion worth of buildings to live in.
And, because those buildings will not be there, construction demand will come roaring back.
If America does recover to the previous long-run trend, the next decade will likely witness a construction boom that puts the mid-2000’s boom in the shade.
But that is not now. And it is not for some years to come.
There is another lesson here.
The economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart argue that recovery after a financial crisis is almost always slow.
But there is at least one important sense in which America’s current construction bust suggests that they are wrong.
One factor behind slow post-financial-crisis recovery is that nobody knows how the division of labor will be rearranged.
But right now we know a lot about that.
We know that when Americans become confident again – when they believe that they could find new jobs if they lost their current ones, and when they can no longer tolerate doubling-up with their in-laws – they will demand more dwellings than the country has today.
If incomes and demand were normal, we would want a lot more new construction then we do now.
But, even though we can see the magnitude of the construction shortfall and understand how large it will be when recovery is complete, that does not help right now.
Right now, incomes are slack, households have become crowded, and there is a surplus of housing on the market – all because nominal demand is still far below trend.
In 20 years, historians will interview the then-aged monetary, banking, and fiscal policymakers of the 2000’s.
They will ask them why they did not take more aggressive steps to return nominal incomes and demand to trend levels when they were sitting in the hot seats.
I already wonder what their excuses will be.

Jeremy Lin and the Political Economy of Superstars
CAMBRIDGE – The biggest news around Cambridge in recent weeks has been Jeremy Lin, the Harvard economics graduate who has shocked the National Basketball Association by rising overnight from “nowhere” to become a genuine star, leading a losing New York Knicks team to an unlikely string of victories.
Lin’s success is delicious, partly because it contradicts so many cultural prejudices about Asian-American athletes.
Flabbergasted experts who overlooked Lin have been saying things like “he just didn’t look the part.” Lin’s obvious integrity and graciousness has won him fans outside the sport as well.
The whole world has taken note, with Lin being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated for two consecutive issues.
The NBA, which has been trying to build brand recognition and interest in China, is thrilled.
I confess to being a huge Lin fan.
Indeed, my teenage son has been idolizing Lin’s skills and work ethic ever since Lin starred on the Harvard team.
But, as an economist observing the public’s seething anger over the “one percenters,” or individuals with exceptionally high incomes, I also see a different, overlooked facet of the story.
What amazes me is the public’s blasé acceptance of the salaries of sports stars, compared to its low regard for superstars in business and finance.
Half of all NBA players’ annual salaries exceed $2 million, more than five times the threshold for the top 1% of household incomes in the United States.
Because long-time superstars like Kobe Bryant earn upwards of $25 million a year, the average annual NBA salary is more than $5 million.
Indeed, Lin’s salary, at $800,000, is the NBA’s “minimum wage” for a second-season player.
Presumably, Lin will soon be earning much more, and fans will applaud.
Yet many of these same fans would almost surely argue that CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, whose median compensation is around $10 million, are ridiculously overpaid.
If a star basketball player reacts a split-second faster than his competitors, no one has a problem with his earning more for every game than five factory workers do in a year.
But if, say, a financial trader or a corporate executive is paid a fortune for being a shade faster than competitors, the public suspects that he or she is undeserving or, worse, a thief.
Economists have long studied the economics of superstars in fields where a company can lever enormously the decisions of a small number of individuals, making them valuable in a way that someone who can, say, chop down trees like the legendary Paul Bunyan, is not.
But the political economy of what levels of income differences countries will tolerate remains uncharted territory.
Of course, there is a certain logic to the public’s disdain for superstar compensation outside of professional sports and entertainment.
This is especially the case in some areas of finance that are essentially zero-sum games, in which one person’s gain is another’s loss.
There are other areas, such as technology, in which someone like Apple’s late founder, Steve Jobs, arguably delivers real innovation and quality, rather than just employing lawyers and lobbyists to maintain a monopoly position.
As a basketball fan, I would not describe the sport as a zero-sum game, even though one team wins and one team loses.
The best players have huge creative flair.
But so do some “street ball” players who excel in slam-dunk theatrics; perhaps because they are not tall enough to compete, they make almost nothing.
Do fans tolerate outsize sports incomes because players are role models?
Many certainly are, but not all high-paid sports celebrities are exemplary citizens.
Michael Vick, a star quarterback in the US National Football League, served time in prison for running a vicious dog-fighting operation, and arrests of players on charges ranging from illegal possession of drugs and weapons to domestic battery have been a regular occurrence.
And, back on the field or court, serious infractions occur all the time.
Think of Zinedine Zidane’s infamous head butt in the 2006 football World Cup.
In the NBA itself, a star player, Ron Artest, was suspended for the remainder of the 2004 season after going into the stands and brawling with heckling fans during a game.
(Artest has now changed his name to Metta World Peace, perhaps in response.)
Moreover, sports teams surely lobby governments as aggressively as any big business.
Professional sport is a legislated monopoly in most countries, with top teams extracting free stadiums and other privileges from host cities.
Indeed, Lin’s story, it should be remembered, grew out of a huge labor dispute between the NBA’s billionaire owners and its millionaire players over division of the league’s nearly $4 billion in annual revenues – more than many countries’ national income.
As the late University of Chicago economist Sherwin Rosen postulated, globalization and changing communication technologies have increasingly made the economics of superstars important in a variety of fields.
That is certainly true in sports and entertainment, but it is also the case in business and finance.
I wish Lin a long and successful career as a superstar, though he will have already had a huge cultural impact even if his success proves meteoric.
One can hope that, as Asian-Americans continue to break barriers in other arenas – they remain under-represented among corporate CEOs, for example – these rising superstars will be greeted with similar acclaim.
If the public is not happy about high superstar incomes, the obvious remedy is to improve the tax system, including for powerful sports-team owners, many of whom benefit from huge tax breaks in their day jobs.
Who knows?
With a more level playing field, superstars outside sports and entertainment might find themselves a bit better appreciated.

Democracy on the Nile?
The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections may be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab World.
Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years.
Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years and say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot.
This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90% of the vote, albeit amid indifferent turnout.
Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot.
Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process.
Egypt could not truly set out on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution – to downsize the Pharaonic powers of its president and set limits on his term in office.
Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president.
So the announcement that he wants competitive presidential elections is an important first step.
The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage, but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered.
The democratic genie is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region that is now embarking on the road of democracy.
Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way.
The real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections in Iraq, Palestine, and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria’s occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of its former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, show no signs of abating.
Egyptian opposition groups, too, have staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last few weeks.
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader Ayman Nour at the end of January.
The government’s heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown “Kifaya” (Enough) movement, which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime.
Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be holding up.
An alliance of local, regional, and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as-usual on the banks of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.
Only a month ago, Mubarak dismissed demands for constitutional reform as “futile.”
But, whatever combination of events brought about his change of heart, election initiative should be welcomed.
It is a necessary – but insufficient – first step for overhauling Egypt’s stagnant political system.
Egyptians are already wary of token reforms à la Tunisia, where longstanding President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections, but then staged a sham contest with a few handpicked “opponents.”
In previous Tunisian presidential referenda, Bin Ali routinely received 99% of the vote; he now got 96%.
Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.
As a measure of sincerity, he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency, which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place.
Mubarak should also endorse a limit of no more than two successive five-year terms for any president.
Equally necessary are confidence-building measures, including open and equal access to the media, which are now state-controlled.
I have announced that I intend to contest this upcoming presidential election as a way of opening debate on these essential reforms.
But I would gladly go back to my life as a private citizen once guaranteed a free and open election this fall.
If seriously implemented, these steps will transform Mubarak’s legacy.
Along with events in Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine, it may well usher in an Arab spring of freedom, one long overdue.

Asia’s Energy Future
SINGAPORE – Asia’s rise is unstoppable.
What is stoppable is the steep rise in Asia’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Indeed, the decisions to be made by Asia on energy production and use will determine the fate of our planet’s environment.
It is natural for the world to be alarmed by Asia’s growing appetite for energy.
If China and India replicate American per capita consumption of fossil fuels, the resulting greenhouse-gas emissions will only accelerate global warming.
But Asians will not accept Western moralizing on energy use.
The West industrialized rapidly without worrying about climate change, contributing mightily to the stock of greenhouse gases that has led the world ever closer to the tipping point at which global warming can no longer be halted.
If the West now wants to hold Asian countries responsible for restraining new sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, it must first hold itself accountable for its old stock and current emissions.
This is why there is unanimous agreement in Asia, including China and India, that any just solution for climate change demands greater sacrifice from rich Western countries.
The good news is that robust public policy, coupled with rapid advances in technology, could help humanity as a whole reduce its energy consumption.
Consistent policy and superior technology explain why Japan uses one-tenth the energy that China uses to generate the same amount of economic output.
Both China and India can learn a lot from Japan, and both governments, fortunately, are firmly committed to increasing their energy efficiency and use of green technology.
Zhenhua Xie, Chinese President Hu Jintao’s special representative on climate change, has stated categorically that China has no other choice than to pursue sustainable development.
In 2007, China founded its National Leading Group on Climate Change, headed by President Hu, and adopted its National Climate Change Program, the first by any developing country.
China aims to lower its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20% relative to 2005 levels by 2010.
As for India, at the G-8 Summit in July 2009, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, “Nothing could be farther from the truth than the notion that the developing countries were complacent or were not interested in addressing the consequences of climate change.” Indeed, in 2008 India unveiled an ambitious National Action Plan on Climate Change, which includes eight national missions, including solar and enhanced energy efficiency missions.
Asia is also at the forefront of innovative energy technology and policy efforts.
The nonprofit company Grameen Shakti currently leads the world in the installation of solar panels for the rural poor.
From 1996 to 2009, Grameen Shakti installed 750,000 solar home systems in Bangladesh to provide emissions-free electricity to more than two million people.
China doubled the efficiency of rural energy consumption between 1983 and 1998 by distributing safer and cleaner stoves to 185 million households.
In Singapore, regulators are developing an innovative Electricity Vending System to give 1.2 million consumers real-time price signals so that they can learn to conserve electricity during peak periods.
India, China, and a handful of other Asian countries are also witnessing remarkable growth in local alternative energy companies and the use of renewable energy.
India ranks fifth in the world in total production of wind power and third in terms of wind power added in 2008.
Suzlon Energy, an Indian company started in 1995 with just 20 people, has become one of the world’s leading wind power companies, with offices in 21 countries.
Moreover, China is the world leader in total renewable energy capacity, small hydroelectric capacity, and the use of solar hot water heaters; second for wind power added in 2008 (ahead of Germany and Spain); and third in total ethanol production.
Suntech, a Chinese company founded in 2001, is the third largest manufacturer of solar cells in the world.
Japan and South Korea were third in the amount of grid-connected solar photovoltaic panels added in 2008; the Philippines was second for total geothermal power and third for total biomass power; Indonesia was third for total geothermal power.
Yet neither policy nor technological innovations in Asia will solve the world’s climate change problem.
Only a major global bargain between the West and the rest will suffice.
In the eyes of most Asian policymakers, the proposed contribution by the West, especially America, towards solving the problem is woefully inadequate.
The American public is simply not being asked to make any serious sacrifices.
The G-8’s declaration that its members will reduce carbon emissions by 80% in 2050 contains no upfront commitments.
And the clock is ticking.
Today, Earth’s atmosphere already contains 380 parts per million of CO2.
The “tipping point” could come when we reach 450 ppm.
Developing countries, particularly those in Asia, will suffer the worst consequences of global warming: storm damage, rising sea levels, and massive refugee flows.
The Maldives will likely disappear entirely.
In these circumstances, Asians cannot afford to sit back and moralize.
They must formulate and present realistic solutions, and negotiate forcefully and realistically before and during the Copenhagen conference in December 2009 in order to produce a global agreement that is based on an equitable sharing of the global commons.
The biggest challenge Asians face is to use their intellectual and political leadership to save the world and themselves.

Pervez Musharraf’s Long Goodbye
ISLAMABAD – Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency: possible impeachment by the new democratically-elected government.
The potential charges are serious: conspiring to destabilize the government that was elected last February, unlawfully removing the country’s top judges in November 2007, and failing to provide adequate security to Benazir Bhutto before her assassination last December.
Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity, especially following missile attacks by the United States in Pakistan’s tribal areas.
Despite earlier differences on how to deal with Musharraf, Pakistan’s leading political parties are now united against him.
Feuding between the Pakistan People’s Party, led by Benazir’s widower, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Pakistan Muslim League (N), led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, had given Musharraf a chance to regain some standing after his allies were defeated in the February elections.
American reluctance to abandon Musharraf – together with prolonged electricity shortages, which made the new government appear incompetent – also raised his hopes.
Musharraf may be counting on the army, his primary constituency, to bail him out of this crisis.
Though such support remains a possibility, it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf.
Though a protégé of Musharraf, the army’s chief of staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, is a professional soldier for whom the army’s institutional interests are more important than the political interests of his former army boss.
Kayani has repeatedly declared that the army will not interfere in political affairs, and that the parliament and constitution are supreme.
Even if the army is tempted to step in on Musharraf’s behalf, it has been chastened by political developments during the past year.
The entire legal community arose to demand restoration of the country’s judges and reinforcement of the rule of law.
The public’s demand for free elections and the resulting creation of a democratic government have forced the military to accept the public will.
The army has also paid a heavy price for Musharraf’s approach to the war on terror.
Suicide bombers have struck repeatedly at military installations and personnel around the army’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.
An increase in deadly attacks on army convoys in the Pakistan-Afghanistan tribal areas has also pushed the army away from Musharraf.
Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid, and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaeda in the region, its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best.
Consequently, the prestige of the Taliban and other militant groups operating in the area has grown.
In this context, the army, seeking to avoid sole responsibility for reverses, wants a popular government to take charge of policy.
No such government can emerge if the elected parties are unseated.
Nevertheless, there are signs of disagreement on important matters between the government and the army.
The military recently blocked a government move to place Pakistan’s infamous intelligence service, the ISI, under the control of the interior minister rather than the prime minister.
Musharraf backed the military’s opposition to this reform, gaining some gratitude from military commanders.
During Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani’s recent visit to the US, President Bush repeatedly said that his administration supports Pakistan’s democracy, a policy since reiterated by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
This indicates that the US will not back Musharraf in any confrontation between him and Pakistan’s democratic forces.
Most Pakistanis hope so.
Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy.
Rather than trying to face down impeachment and prolonging the crisis, he should recognize that Pakistan cannot afford more instability, and that giving up honorably will bring him some respect.
For the sake of argument, even if Musharraf faces impeachment and by some stroke of luck is saved from being thrown out of office, his future will be bleak.
In March 2009, the current ruling coalition will gain more seats in the Senate, and the government would almost certainly try to impeach him again.
Moreover, any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election, the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February.
It is time for Musharraf’s friends in the West to press him to serve his country one last time, by avoiding confrontation with his country’s democratic forces and calling it quits.

Taking the Fat Out of Global Warming
LONDON – Mitigating climate change presents unrivaled opportunities for improving human health and well being.
Indeed, policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions promise to bring about substantial reductions in heart disease, respiratory illness, cancer, obesity, diabetes, depression, and road deaths and injuries.
These health benefits arise because climate policy necessarily affects two of the most important determinants of human health: nutrition and movement.
Although medical professionals increasingly recognize the health benefits of policies to address climate change, they are not widely appreciated by policymakers themselves.
The existence of these health benefits implies a dramatic reduction in the net cost of taking strong action to mitigate climate change – which means that failure to understand their importance could have serious environmental consequences.
Recent research has documented the multiple health benefits of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
Meeting emissions targets in the transport sector would require, alongside reductions in car use, modest increases in walking and cycling.
Based on the epidemiological evidence linking physical activity and health, the resulting increase in physical activity would dramatically reduce rates of chronic disease, with around 10-20% less heart disease and stroke, 12-18% less breast cancer, and 8% less dementia.
Sustainable transport would also improve our mental health, with an estimated 6% less depression.
There would be additional mental-health benefits from more green spaces, less noise pollution, and greater physical fitness.
Reducing livestock production in order to limit cattle-related methane emissions and deforestation – significant factors contributing to climate change – would also improve human health.
Fewer livestock would mean fewer animal products in our diet, which would reduce our consumption of harmful saturated fats, leading to a 30% decline in heart disease.
Reducing meat consumption should reduce rates of colorectal cancer as well – the second most common type in men, after lung cancer.
By improving diet and raising levels of physical activity, policies to mitigate climate change would result in a dramatic cut in rates of diseases that mean premature death and disability for hundreds of millions of people worldwide.
They would also reduce population fatness.
More than a billion adults are overweight and 300 million are obese, including more than one-third of the US population.
And British government scientists predict that the United Kingdom will be “a predominantly obese society” by 2050.
Indeed, if current trends continue, by 2050, nine in ten adults in many developed countries will be overweight or obese.
In middle-income countries, too, average body mass index (BMI) is rising steadily.
This will have a serious impact on health and well being, increasing the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
But developing countries are also at risk.
Mexico, for example, is second only to the US in terms of the prevalence of obesity.
The increase in diabetes as a result of population fattening is causing an epidemic of chronic kidney disease in a country where only one in four can expect to receive treatment.
The experience of Cuba in the 1990’s confirms the health effects of reducing fossil-fuel consumption.
During the Cuban energy crisis that followed the cut-off of subsidized Soviet supplies, the proportion of adults who were physically active more than doubled.
The population’s average BMI fell by 1.5 units, with a halving in the prevalence of obesity, from 14% to 7%.
Deaths from diabetes fell by 51%, from heart disease by 35%, and from stroke by 20%.
Moreover, there would be less hunger in a de-carbonized world.
In April 2008, Evo Morales, the president of poor and increasingly hungry Bolivia, pleaded for “la vida primero, los autos segundos” (life first, cars second), exhorting the wealthy world to stop burning food every time they drive – a reference to Western governments’ policies on bio-fuels.
But car use and food prices were linked long before bio-fuel policies. Car use drives up food prices, because oil is a key agricultural input.
Reducing oil use in the transport sector is essential to preventing starvation in poor countries.
Until agriculture unshackles itself from dependence on oil, gas tanks in rich countries and stomachs in poor countries will be competing to be filled.
Eating fewer animal products would reduce food prices as well, because cattle are fed on grain.
Other policies aimed at mitigating climate change also have positive effects on health.
Insulating homes in high-income countries in order to save energy would prevent cold-related deaths.
Likewise, use of fuel-efficient cooking stoves in poor countries would reduce the number of children –amp#160;currently around one million per year – who die from respiratory infections caused or worsened by the burning of solid fuels.
A de-carbonization program that cuts across all the major areas of energy use, combined with reduced consumption of animal products, would create substantial benefits for human health and welfare.
As negotiators and policymakers debate the costs of mitigating climate change, they cannot afford to overlook these benefits’ immense value.

Africa’s Urban Farmers
NAIROBI – When I met Eunice Wangari at a Nairobi coffee shop recently, I was surprised to hear her on her mobile phone, insistently asking her mother about the progress of a corn field in her home village, hours away from the big city.
A nurse, Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming.
Even though Wangari lives in Kenya’s capital, she is able to reap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of relatives.
Her initial stake – drawn from her nursing wages of about $350 a month – has long since been recovered.
Wangari is one of thousands of urban workers in Kenya – and one of hundreds of thousands, even millions, across Africa – who are increasing their incomes through absentee agriculture.
With prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades, many urbanites feel well rewarded by farming.
Absentee agriculture also bolsters national pride – and pride in traditional diets – by specializing in vegetables specific to the region. “For too long our country has been flooded with imported food and Westernized foods,” Wangari says.
Across Africa, political leaders, long dismissive of rural concerns, have awakened to the importance of agriculture and the role that educated people, even those living in major cities, can play in farming.
In Nigeria, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has a huge diversified farm and has pushed for policies to help absentee farmers prosper.
In Uganda, Vice President Gilbert Bukenya routinely travels the country, promoting higher-value farming, such as dairy production.
Perhaps the most visible political support for absentee agriculture is in Liberia, a small West African country where civil war destroyed agriculture, rendering the population dependent on food imports, even today.
President Johnson-Sirleaf, recognizing that educated people could contribute much to an agriculture revival, launched her “Back to the Soil” campaign in June 2008 in large part to encourage urban dwellers to farm.
To be sure, absentee farming by elites and educated urban workers can’t solve all of Africa’s urgent food needs.
Moreover, absentee farmers face unexpected problems.
Because they don’t visit their fields often, they rely heavily on relatives and friends. When I decided to farm wheat for the first time this spring on leased land in my childhood village, my mother agreed to supervise plowing, planting, and harvesting.
Without her help, I might not have farmed at all.
Even with mother’s help, I have worries.
Although I grew up around wheat fields, my knowledge of farming is thin.
Fertilizer and spraying were both more expensive than I thought.
While my wheat stalks are sprouting on schedule, I now fear that at harvest time – in November – prices will fall and I won’t recoup my costs.
One key tool is the mobile phone.
My hopes for success are buoyed by my ability to call my mother inexpensively and discuss the farm.
We even decided over the phone what kind of pesticide to use and which tractor company to hire.
Because they know both the tastes of fellow city dwellers and rural conditions, many urban farmers are succeeding.
In fact, some city dwellers don’t even bother with acquiring land or gaining distant help.
Certain crops can be grown in their own homes.
James Memusi, an accountant, grows mushrooms in a spare bedroom, selling them to nearby hotels and supermarkets.
Nevertheless, most people living in Africa’s cities have access to land in the countryside, which is why Liberia’s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion.
In a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer, the authorities declared, “The soil is a bank; invest in it.”
In Liberia, the main push is to reduce imports of staples such as rice and tomatoes.
In more prosperous countries, African elites are motivated by a complex interplay of national pride, dietary concerns, and the pursuit of profit.
In Zambia, for example, Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants.
Now, ordinary Lusakans want to cook similar meals in their own homes, driving demand for farmers who produce such delicacies as dried pumpkin, “black jack” leaves, and fresh Okra.
Similarly, in Nairobi, Miringo Kinyanjui, another woman entrepreneur, is supplying unrefined – and more nutritious – maize and wheat flour.
In another move to distinguish her ingredients from Western versions, Kinyanjui also sells through grocery stores flour flavored with Amarathan, a green vegetable that grows around Kenya.
The revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations.
Last year, Unilever’s Kenyan branch ran a “taste our culture” campaign in support of its line of traditional East African herbs and spices.
Such campaigns go hand-in-hand with expanded farming, because sellers of these foods prefer nearby growers – even if these growers increasingly live in the city.

American Retreats
Los Angeles – As Barack Obama’s incoming administration debates the pace and consequences of withdrawal from Iraq, it would do well to examine the strategic impact of other American exits in the final decades of the twentieth century.
Although American commitments to Lebanon, Somalia, Vietnam, and Cambodia differed mightily, history reveals that despite immediate costs to America’s reputation, disengagement ultimately redounded to America’s advantage.
In all of these cases, regional stability of sorts emerged after an American military withdrawal, albeit at the cost of a significant loss of life.
America’s former adversaries either became preoccupied with consolidating or sharing power, suffered domestic defeat, or confronted neighboring states.
Ultimately, America’s vital interests prevailed.
The evidence today suggests that this pattern can be repeated when the United States departs Mesopotamia and leaves Iraqis to define their own fate.
Of the four withdrawals, arguably the 1982-1984 American intervention in Lebanon marks the closest parallel to Iraq today.
A country torn by sectarian violence beginning in 1975, Lebanon pitted an even more complex array of contestants against each other than Iraq does today.
Into this fray stepped the US and its Western allies.
Their objective was to create a military buffer between the PLO and Israeli forces that were then fighting in Beirut in order to promote the departure of both.
The massacres in Palestinian refugee camps prompted a new commitment to “restore a strong and central government” to Lebanon, to quote President Ronald Reagan.
But the result of intervention was that US forces became just one more target, culminating in the 1983 bombing of a US Marine barracks that killed 241 American soldiers.
A similar suicide bombing two days later claimed the lives of 58 French soldiers.
In February 1984, facing a quagmire, Reagan acceded to Vice President George H.W. Bush’s recommendation to get out of Lebanon.
But the withdrawal of Western forces did not stop the fighting.
The civil war continued for another six years, followed by a bumpy political aftermath: Syrian intervention and expulsion (two decades later), as the Lebanese defined their own fate with the US exercising only background influence.
In 1992, the sirens of Somalia’s political collapse lured the US into another civil war to save a country from itself.
The US humanitarian mission to that benighted country sought to salvage a failed United Nations enterprise to secure and feed Somalia’s ravaged population.
The US committed 28,000 troops, which for a time imposed a modicum of security.
But ill-equipped and poorly led UN replacement forces for the American presence put the remaining US troops in the bull’s eye as they attempted to bring to justice the Somali warlord responsible for the death of Pakistani peacekeepers.
The ensuing bloodbath of US soldiers generated images that the American public could not stomach, prompting the exit of American and then UN forces.
As unrest mounted with these military retreats, offshore US forces monitored and intercepted jihadists who sought to enter Somalia, while Kenya and Ethiopia blocked the unrest from metastasizing across the region.
In 2006, the capture of Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, by the Islamic Courts raised the specter of a jihadist state.
But Somalia soon demonstrated that quagmires can be a two-way street.
Following Ethiopia’s intervention, the Islamists found themselves out of power.
Today, Somalia remains a dysfunctional state, as rival clans, jihadists, and an interim government with Ethiopian support compete for power.
The US, now out of the quagmire, exercises limited influence from afar.
While Lebanon and Somalia remain damaged and failed states, respectively, regional and domestic factors have cauterized the consequences of America’s retreat from Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
The result is the stable region that the world sees today.
But the US saw things very differently in the 1960’s, when the ghosts of Munich hovered over Vietnam’s jungles.
As President George W. Bush argued about the war in Iraq, US President Lyndon Johnson predicted that defeat in Vietnam “would be renewed in one country and then another.”
What Johnson failed to foresee were the domestic and regional constraints that would prevent the dominos from falling in the way he predicted.
Although the US bombed northeastern Cambodia intensely throughout the Vietnam War years, it had no stomach for a ground commitment there.
Still within congressional restraints, the Nixon administration attempted to bolster Cambodia’s military government.
But, despite modest material support, the US could not sustain a government that could not sustain itself.
Rather than the dominos falling following America’s retreat from Saigon in 1975, a Vietnam-Cambodian War ensued.
This in turn stimulated China’s unsuccessful intervention in North Vietnam.
The withdrawal by all of these invading armies to the recognized international boundaries demonstrated that nationalist forces were dominant in the region, not communist solidarity.
None of these American exits was without consequence.
But, while the US suffered costs to its reputation around the world, the supposed advantages from this for America’s opponents proved illusory.
America’s departure from Mesopotamia will likewise put the burden of problem solving onto Iraqis and other regional players, leaving the US offshore to assist when and where it deems appropriate.
History suggests that, in fits and starts, Iraq, like Vietnam and Lebanon, will find itself able to sort out its own affairs.

The Arab Spring’s Unlikely Winner
PARIS – The war in Iraq – which led in 2003 to the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime – had one clear winner: Iran.
The United States-led military intervention resulted in the weakening of the Middle East’s Sunni regimes, America’s traditional allies, and the strengthening of America’s principal foe in the region, the Islamic Republic.
Ten years later, we may be witnessing yet another ironic outcome in the region: At least for the time being, Israel seems to be the only clear winner of the “Arab Spring” revolutions.
Most Israelis would strongly object to this interpretation.
Their regional environment has become much more unstable and unpredictable.
Only a few days ago, Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system intercepted a rocket fired from Sinai that was aimed at the port of Eilat.
In contrast to the past, no Israeli border is now secure, especially the long frontier with Egypt.
No implicit alliance can be taken for granted.
All scenarios are open.
Can Israel remain an oasis of stability, security, modernity, and economic growth in such a volatile environment?
The answer, of course, is no.
Israel may be tempted to regard itself as some kind of latter-day Noah’s ark, but it is not.
Tel Aviv has become a cross between San Francisco, Singapore, and São Paulo, but it is still less than 300 kilometers from Damascus.
For the pessimists (or realists, depending on your perspective), Israel must remain on maximum alert to minimize the risks that it faces.
Above all, many Israelis (if not most) believe that this is no time to be imaginative and daring.
The resumption of the peace process with the Palestinian Authority can be only a fig leaf.
Israel simply cannot ignore the Americans in the way that the Egyptian army has as it massacres its Islamist opponents.
But a very different reading of the current situation is possible.
What started as a revolution in the eighteenth-century meaning of the term is becoming a reproduction of the religious wars that ravaged Europe from 1524 to 1648, pitting Catholics and Protestants against each other in the same way that Sunnis and Shia are pitted against each other today.
(In Egypt, however, we are seeing simply the return of a military police state.)
One may disagree with this Euro-centric interpretation, but what is clear is that the Muslim Middle East will be too preoccupied with internecine struggle to worry about the Palestinians or the existence of Israel.
War with Jews or Christians has necessarily taken a back seat (except where, as in Egypt and Syria, Christian minorities are perceived to be allied with the regime).
In some cases, there is explicit cooperation with Israel.
Because it is fighting for its own survival in a highly challenging environment, the Jordanian regime needs Israel’s security collaboration.
Indeed, Israeli and Jordanian forces are now working together to secure their respective borders against infiltration by jihadists from Iraq or Syria, while Egypt and Israel now share the same objective in Sinai.
So the paradox of the Arab revolutions is that they have contributed to Israel’s integration as a strategic partner (for some countries) in the region.
At this point, more Arab lives have been lost in Syria’s civil war alone than in all of the Arab-Israeli wars combined.
Of course, one should not draw the wrong conclusions from this.
Israel may have become, more than ever, a key strategic partner for some Arab regimes, or a de facto ally against Iran (as it is for Saudi Arabia).
But this does not imply that Israel’s neighbors have resigned themselves, in emotional terms, to its continued existence in their midst.
Nor does it mean that Israel can do whatever it wants, whenever and wherever it wants.
On the contrary, the Israeli government should not use the region’s turmoil as justification for doing nothing to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians.
Current conditions, though admittedly confusing, can be seen as opening a window of opportunity – a moment to consider making serious sacrifices for the sake of long-term survival.
Israel should be addressing the Arab world in the following terms: “You may not like me, and you may never like me, but I am not – and never should have been – your first concern.
Now it is clear that you have other priorities to worry about.”
The Arab quagmire may not be creating conditions for peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.
But it has turned the “strategic truce” favored by many Arab leaders into the only conceivable alternative.
Arabs cannot be at war with themselves and with Israel at the same time.
The chaotic events unfolding in the Middle East will – and should – change the approach and perceptions of the protagonists.
Short-term considerations will not suffice.
Israeli leaders must adjust their long-term strategic thinking to the new Middle East that ultimately emerges from the current disarray.
That means not exploiting today’s opportunity to build more settlements on Palestinian land, or to expand existing ones, as Binyamin Netanyahu’s government appears determined to do.
Israel may well be the current winner in the Arab Spring; but, if it is wise, it will leave the spoils of victory on the ground.

Understanding Sanders
NEW YORK – When US Senator Bernie Sanders describes himself as a “democratic socialist,” he arguably is using those words in a different way than many other people.
Once that becomes clear, more American voters should have reason to support him than currently do.
The original meaning of socialism implied public ownership of the means of production, or, more colloquially, the nationalization of firms and corporations.
Being a socialist by this definition would indeed be a mistake. For starters, the state is not an efficient manager.
Moreover, in the long run, this model of socialism has been shown to lead to a society quite opposite to the one that state ownership was meant to achieve.
The experience of the Soviet Union demonstrated why it is a mistake to centralize ownership in the hands of the state, with all the booty in one place.
Sooner or later, control of it is bound to be captured by a few individuals – the nomenklatura during communism’s heyday, followed by oligarchs during its decay.
In other words, the last stage of this kind of socialism is, ironically, crony capitalism.
Listen carefully to Sanders, however, and it quickly becomes evident that he aspires to a very different “socialism” – namely, a variant of the Nordic model, refashioned for the twenty-first century.
The Nordic countries are vastly more equitable than the United States, and, contrary to popular opinion, their economies also allow for greater upward mobility.
A poor person in Denmark, for example, has a much greater chance of moving up the income ladder than their counterpart in today’s America.
Sanders has stressed this, and he has a long track record of activism on behalf of the poor and the marginalized.
He seems genuinely inclusive, and has repeatedly stated his opposition to discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation, even though this is not always a popular stance.
It is to his credit that he has not muffled this message in an attempt to gain popularity.
Sanders makes it clear that this is who he is, and one must take him or leave him with this in mind.
In the process, he has brought a rare moral voice to the political arena.
Such an approach is needed, because the level of inequality in the world today is unacceptable.
In the long run, it damages democracy, because the poor cannot have a voice when they are so completely marginalized.
Sanders’s repeated attacks on inequality address this threat head-on.
In fact, he is a social democrat, and thus closer to his fellow senator, Elizabeth Warren, one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, than their rhetorical differences might suggest.
The challenge facing the next US president will be formidable. Donald Trump’s tenure has damaged not only America, but also, given the country’s global importance, the wider world.
We now live in a polarized world where the plight of the worst off is more hopeless than it has been in a long time.
In their hopelessness, these people often have ended up supporting the very leaders who care least about them.
Creating a society that is vibrant, growth-oriented, democratic, and equitable will not be easy, because, as Anand Giridharadas recently argued in The New York Times, the super-rich have a vested interest in the status quo.
Reality is more granular than the words we have to describe it, which invites deliberate muddling of terms, such as labeling someone who favors reining in extreme inequality as a supporter of Soviet communism.
Furthermore, globalization and robotics – or globotics, as Richard Baldwin and Rikard Forslid pithily put it – are changing the landscape of work and the distribution of wealth.
We are in new territory and will need novel policies to navigate it.
For example, standard policies such as antitrust laws are losing their efficacy as conventional wage-paying work shrinks, and earnings increasingly accrue to those who own capital and hold the patents to new machines and products.
So, it is important to admit that we do not know quite what the right policies are.
There will have to be many experiments with new policies, and whoever is America’s president will need to be prepared to modify these policies and change course when necessary.
Given the circumstances, it is important that the president has the intention, as well as the intelligence and flexibility, to experiment and adjust.
Several Democratic candidates have these critical qualities (the few Republicans that also do have been marginalized by Trump’s ascendancy), but Sanders stands out in this regard.
I believe that Sanders’s goals for America cannot all be met.
If nothing else, fiscal constraints will make it impossible.
But that need not be a serious problem if Sanders were to win in November and then learn as he goes along.
And meeting even a subset of his objectives will represent a move in the right direction.
Recently, some Democratic voters have turned away from Sanders, following reports that Russia is supporting him in the Democratic primary.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is said, wants Trump to win and believes that he will if pitted against Sanders.
But a little game theory suggests that Putin may himself have engineered the leak, because he knows that Sanders is the only candidate who can defeat Trump.
By letting it be known that he is backing Sanders, Putin hopes to ensure that many Democrats will not support the Vermont senator.
And that would be good news for Trump.

What Iran Wants in 2014
TEHRAN – When I campaigned to become President of Iran, I promised to balance realism and the pursuit of the Islamic Republic’s ideals – and won Iranian voters’ support by a large margin.
By virtue of the popular mandate that I received, I am committed to moderation and common sense, which is now guiding all of my government’s policies.
That commitment led directly to the interim international agreement reached in November in Geneva on Iran’s nuclear program.
It will continue to guide our decision-making in 2014.
Indeed, in terms of foreign policy, my government is discarding extreme approaches.
We seek effective and constructive diplomatic relations and a focus on mutual confidence-building with our neighbors and other regional and international actors, thereby enabling us to orient our foreign policy toward economic development at home.
To this end, we will work to eliminate tensions in our foreign relations and strengthen our ties with traditional and new partners alike.
This obviously requires domestic consensus-building and transparent goal-setting – processes that are now underway.
While we will avoid confrontation and antagonism, we will also actively pursue our larger interests.
But, given an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world, challenges can be addressed only through interaction and active cooperation among states.
No country – including big powers – can effectively address on its own the challenges that it faces.
Indeed, developing and emerging economies’ rapid “catch-up growth” suggests that their aggregate economic weight is about to surpass that of the advanced world.
Today’s developing and emerging countries are likely to account for nearly 60% of world GDP by 2030, up from around 40% in 2000, enabling them to play a much greater role on the world stage.
In such a period of transition, Iran can enhance its global role.
The election this year, in which close to 75% of eligible voters turned out, showed how our religious democracy is maturing.
Iran’s ancient culture and civilization, long state continuity, geopolitical position, social stability amid regional turmoil, and well-educated youth enable us to look to the future with confidence, and aspire to assume the major global role that our people deserve – a role that no actor in global politics can ignore.
We are also considering how to rebuild and improve our bilateral and multilateral relations with European and North American countries on the basis of mutual respect.
This requires easing tensions and implementing a comprehensive approach that includes economic ties.
We can begin by avoiding any new strain in relations between Iran and the United States and, at the same time, endeavoring to eliminate inherited tensions that continue to mar relations between our countries.
While we may not be able to forget the mistrust and suspicion that have haunted Iranians’ thinking about US governments for the last 60 years, now we must focus on the present and look to the future.
That means rising above petty politics and leading, rather than following, pressure groups in our respective countries.
In our view, cooperating on issues of mutual interest and concern would contribute to easing tensions in our region as well.
This means countering those in the US and our region who seek to distract international attention from issues in which they are directly involved and prevent Iran from enhancing its regional status.
By diminishing the prospects for a permanent negotiated agreement on our nuclear program, such behavior increases the likelihood that the Iran-US standoff will continue.
Our region is grappling more than ever with sectarianism, group enmities, and potential new breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism.
At the same time, the recent use of chemical weapons in Syria could haunt the region’s peoples for many years.
We believe that, under such circumstances, a voice of moderation in the region could affect the course of events in a constructive and positive way.
There is no doubt that the turmoil in nearby countries affects the interests of many regional and global actors, which need to act in concert to ensure long-term stability.
Iran, as a major regional power, is fully prepared to move in this direction, sparing no effort to facilitate solutions.
So those who portray Iran as a threat and thus seek to undermine its regional and global credibility should cease – in the interest of peace and tranquility in the region and beyond.
I am profoundly disturbed over the humanitarian tragedy in Syria and the enormous suffering that the Syrian people have endured for almost three years.
Representing a people who have experienced the horror of chemical weapons, my government strongly condemned their use in the Syrian conflict.
I am also concerned that parts of Syrian territory have become breeding grounds for extremist ideologies and rallying points for terrorists, which is reminiscent of the situation on our eastern border in the 1990’s.
This is an issue of concern to many other countries as well, and finding a durable political solution in Syria requires cooperation and joint efforts.
So we are pleased that in 2013 diplomacy prevailed over threats of military intervention in Syria.
We must build on this headway and understand that Syria is in dire need of coordinated regional and international efforts.
We are ready to contribute to peace and stability in Syria in the course of serious negotiations among regional and extra-regional parties.
Here, too, we need to prevent the talks from becoming a zero-sum game.
That is no less true of Iran’s peaceful nuclear-energy program, which has been subject to enormous hype in recent decades.
Since the early 1990’s, one prediction after another regarding how close Iran was to acquiring a nuclear bomb has proved baseless.
Throughout this period, alarmists tried to paint Iran as a threat to the Middle East and the world.
We all know who the chief agitator is, and what purposes are to be served by hyping this issue.
We know also that this claim fluctuates in proportion to the amount of international pressure to stop settlement construction and end the occupation of Palestinian lands.
These false alarms continue, despite US national intelligence estimates according to which Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon.
In fact, we are committed not to work toward developing and producing a nuclear bomb.
As enunciated in the fatwa issued by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, we strongly believe that the development, production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons are contrary to Islamic norms.
We never even contemplated the option of acquiring nuclear weapons, because we believe that such weapons could undermine our national-security interests; as a result, they have no place in Iran’s security doctrine.
Even the perception that Iran may develop nuclear weapons is detrimental to our security and overall national interest.
During my presidential campaign, I committed myself to doing everything in my power to fast-track a resolution to the standoff over our nuclear-energy program.
To fulfill this commitment and benefit from the window of opportunity that the recent election opened, my government is prepared to leave no stone unturned in seeking a mutually acceptable permanent solution.
Following up on November’s interim agreement, we are ready to continue to work with the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany) and others with a view to ensuring our nuclear program’s full transparency.
The peaceful nuclear capability that we have achieved will be used within an internationally recognized framework of safeguards, and it will be accessible to multilateral monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, as has been the case in the past several years.
In this way, the international community can ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program.
We will never forgo our right to benefit from nuclear energy; but we are ready to work toward removing any ambiguity and answer any reasonable question about our program.
The continuation of pressure, arm-twisting, intimidation, and measures aimed at cutting off Iranians’ access to a whole range of necessities – from technology to medicines and foodstuffs – can only poison the atmosphere and undermine the conditions needed to make progress.
As we showed in 2013, Iran is fully prepared to engage seriously with the international community and to negotiate with our interlocutors in good faith.
We hope that our counterparts, too, are ready to take advantage of this window of opportunity.

The Scientific Men's Club
I serve on the senior appointments and promotions committee of a medical school.
Over the years, I've come to recognize something that is as disturbing as it is undeniable: as a group, male basic scientists sail through the committee effortlessly.
Many work in fields so specialized that they have only ten colleagues in the entire world, half of whom are their mentors or one-time fellow graduate students.
These are their "peers," and they readily provide laudatory letters of recommendation establishing that the applicant has attained "national and international recognition."
In contrast, applications by clinical faculty and women provoke far more discussion.
I don't resent the ease with which basic science faculty are promoted; after all, I am sure that I also enjoyed the perks that come with this designation.
Nonetheless, the system seems blatantly unfair.
We rely on external referees for promoting basic scientists, who publish their work in national or international journals.
By contrast, it is difficult to quantify how good clinical scientists are.
Indeed, we struggle--more or less successfully, I think--even to define what a "scholarly" practicing physician is, because a clinician's reputation rests on local interactions that are often difficult to document.
The issue of women faculty members, especially in basic sciences, is far more complex.
I suspect that here the problem reflects fundamental differences between the way women and men approach science as a microcosm of life.
Most of my fellow male faculty members are not muscle-bound, testosterone-driven types, but in their scientific careers, they display two types of typically male behavior.
The first is a compulsion to be the first to establish completely trivial facts about science.
As I grow older, I'm no longer sure why this is so important, but the male members of our species seem to think that it is.
Most young male faculty members have an obsessive need to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week to make sure that a (sometimes-illusory) competitor is beaten to the punch.
Ten or 15 years from now, will anybody care?
Most women in basic sciences seem to be uninterested from the outset in playing such games.
The second male behavior is a patricidal imperative that is perhaps the most shameful and atavistic of the primal impulses that still lurk in some archaic part of our brains.
The idea that one must somehow supplant one's mentor, cast the previous generation out into the wilderness, and make oneself the leader of the pack seems to obsess men.
Women scientists seem to behave far more collegially.
There is a certain senior (male) faculty member who is one of the kindest and most accomplished investigators at my institution.
He is surrounded by and works with a group of young women he has mentored.
Most are bright, creative, and productive in their own right, but they do not seek desperately to dissociate themselves from him, establish their own little fiefdoms elsewhere, and beat him at his own game.
At the risk of sounding simplistic, I can't help feeling that working together as a group is an innately feminine tendency.
More importantly, I can't help believing that this way of operating is ultimately far more scientifically productive than the traditional male drive to establish one's own "identity" and "independence."
Unfortunately, one of the unwritten laws of academia--unquestioned by the committee on which I serve--is that a candidate who does not seek and grasp the holy grail of "independence" is not qualified to be promoted.
Almost every time a woman candidate comes up before the committee, her "independence" is questioned in a way that is irrelevant, if not insulting.
Sadder still, the most stringent adherents to and enforcers of this male paradigm are the rare women that have "made it" in the male world to serve on the committee.
"I made it," they seem to say, "so why can't she?"
In most cases, the women are as smart as the men, if not smarter.
But most have chosen to work either in a group with their mentors or with their husbands, who often work in the same fields.
Although they generate as many of the ideas as their male colleagues do, it is the latter who go to meetings and present the group's research results.
This seems to me to reflect women's all-too-common impulse to accommodate the unbridled male ego rather than any deficiency in their creativity or "independence."
There was surely a time when eschewing children and family was the only way that a woman could prove her commitment to science.
In many places, that has begun to change.
I hope that the time will come when there are enough women in science that a greater diversity of female role models is represented in bodies that decide about careers.
This would encourage greater sympathy for and empathy with the different needs and impulses of women and men--and a deeper appreciation that the male paradigm is not the only valid one within which to live life and excel in science.

India's Pseudo-Democracy
Recently, India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said that despite the outward appearance of health, Indian democracy appears to have become hollow, with elections reduced to a farce and the "party system eroded due to unethical practices."
According to Vajpayee, "The outer shell of democracy is, no doubt, intact, but appears to be moth-eaten from inside."
Indeed, in the preface to a recent collection of his speeches, Vajpayee wondered whether democracy had truly taken root in India.
"How can democratic institutions work properly," he asked, "when politics is becoming increasingly criminalized?"
This is a strange turn, for parliamentary democracy has long been a source of pride for most Indians.
The country may not match up to its Asian neighbors in prosperity, but Indians have always been able to boast of the vitality of their parliamentary system.
Nowadays, such boasts are heard far less frequently.
Not only are India's economic failures more obvious, in comparison to Asia's revived economic juggernauts; so, too, are the failures of its political system.
Unprincipled politics, cults of violence, communal rage, and macabre killings of religious minorities have all combined to shake people's faith in the political system's viability.
Small wonder, then, that people are starting to ask whether India needs an alternative system of government.
Part of the problem lies in India's deracinated party politics.
For decades, the Congress Party of Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, basically ruled the country unchallenged.
But with the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and her son, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Congress disintegrated and has not recovered.
Rather than ushering in an era of recognizable multi-party politics, Indian democracy still lacks a party system worthy of the name.
One reason for this is that there are barely any national parties.
Instead, India is saddled with highly volatile leader-based groups.
When the leadership is charismatic and strong, the party is a servile instrument.
Lacking coherent principles or an overriding ideology, these groups fragment when their leadership changes or splits, as Congress did.
Where parties are weak, there can be no party discipline.
India's parliament is riddled with defections by MPs, who move freely from one party grouping to another.
So endemic is the buying and selling of legislators that parliament looks a lot like a cattle market.
The prizes conferred on opportunistic defectors not only undermine the party system, but weaken the foundations of parliament by making organized opposition impossible.
Public apathy bordering on fatalism is the inevitable result.
This is dangerous because apathy does not take the form of withdrawal from public life, but increasingly finds expression in sectarian and religious conflict.
Of course, politicians incite many of these conflicts, using caste, sect, and religion--not political ideas--to build voter loyalty.
But apathy about democracy is what makes so many ordinary Indians prey to poisonous appeals.
This susceptibility is the clearest sign that India's experiment with the Westminster model of parliamentary democracy has failed to justify the hopes that prevailed fifty years ago when the Constitution was proclaimed.
Back then, parliament was seen as a means to bridge the divides of caste, religion, and region.
Parliament's increasing irrelevance in sorting out these problems--indeed, its role in exacerbating them--is fueling a growing preference among Indians for a presidential system of government that removes executive functions from the oversight of an institution that has been addled and rendered impotent by undisciplined factions.
Of course, politicians are not the only people at fault here.
Sadly, Indian society never really embraced the consensual values that India's Constitution proclaims: a participatory, decentralized democracy; an egalitarian society with minimal social and economic disparities; a secularized polity; the supremacy of the rule of law; a federal structure ensuring partial autonomy to provinces; cultural and religious pluralism; harmony between rural and urban areas; and an efficient, honest state administration at both the national and local level.
Instead, race and caste remain as potent as ever.
Wealth is as grossly distributed as ever.
Corruption rules many state governments and national ministries.
Urban and rural areas subvert each other.
But parliaments demand a minimal national consensus if they are to function, for they are creatures of compromise in decision-making.
Executive governments, on the other hand, are creatures of decision: a popularly elected president is ultimately responsible to his voters, not to his party colleagues.
The very election by national suffrage of an executive provides the type of minimal consensus that India's faction-riven parliaments have, sadly, never been able to cultivate.
Of course, a president will undoubtedly need to compromise with his legislature, but the general consent that is gained by popular election implies at least some broader agreement behind the platform that he or she campaigned on.
Of course, no magic bullet will do away with the forces that divide India.
But at least some of the maladies of the current parliamentary system, such as defection, party factionalism, inherent political instability, and crippling coalition politics can be minimized, if not eliminated, by adopting an executive-dominant model of presidential democracy.
In adopting such a system, Indians would have nothing to lose but the corruption and chaos of today's discredited parliament.

Europe’s Blame Game
The European Union’s leaders have just met to draw the lessons from the failed referenda on the Constitutional Treaty.
But they need not search too far for culprits; indeed, they need only look in the mirror and confront the consequences of the dishonest game that the leaders of EU member states have played for too long.
Over the years, those leaders hoped to reap the benefits of reform while avoiding the blame, so they routinely let EU officials based in Brussels take the political heat for unpopular but necessary measures.
They then bitterly complained to their people about “Brussels bureaucrats” and their undemocratic ways.
But these leaders forgot that their people might actually believe them.
So, when the leaders of France and the Netherlands – pro-constitution to a fault – asked their people what they thought about the Union, they received a clear echo of their own message: the people did not like the reforms, and they did not like the “Brussels bureaucrats,” constitution or no constitution.
Nowhere has this game of passing the blame been more visible than in the way EU governments have handled the deregulation of the product market.
The rewards to be gained by deregulating product markets are very large.
Breaking up monopolies often yields dramatically lower prices and thus higher living standards for consumers, because the same wage buys a lot more.
Consider deregulation of telecommunications and airlines, which has ushered in competition from low-cost carriers of data and people.
Deregulation also leads to economies of scale, lowering prices even further, as we all know when shopping at the hypermarket rather than the corner grocery store.
But deregulation inevitably brings disruptions.
Consumers gain, but some workers lose.
Existing firms often have a hard time adapting. New, leaner firms take over.
In the process, old firms go bankrupt, workers are laid off.
Rents disappear, and think of the effects of airline deregulation on pilots’ salaries.
Even if as many or more jobs are created as are destroyed, this does not eliminate the pain of those who find themselves unemployed.
By any estimate, with a decent safety net for workers who lose their jobs, the benefits of deregulation far exceed the costs and the pain they cause.
But this does not make governments’ political task much easier, because the benefits are diffuse: consumers paying less for airline tickets may not attribute it to deregulation.
By contrast, the costs are localized: airline workers who risk losing their jobs are intensely aware of the connection between deregulation and layoffs.
Of course, governments could try to explain why they pursue deregulation.
But it is much easier for them to adopt a low profile, get the “Brussels bureaucrats” to do it, and then blame those Brussels officials, indeed the EU, for any and all of the pain.
Or could it really be true that “Brussels” has overstepped its powers, forcing more deregulation than national governments wanted?
This exonerating hypothesis does not hold water.
The case of airline deregulation is again revealing.
Twice in the last ten years, national governments have explicitly given the EU the authority to tighten constraints on their subsidies to failing airline companies.
Governments did not have to cede these powers.
But they did, and this did not prevent them for blaming “Brussels” strongly and loudly for these very constraints when their own national airlines got in trouble.
Having triggered and then witnessed the “anti-Brussels” vote, what should European governments do?
One piece of good news is that deregulation of product markets has been largely achieved, so there is less need to play the Brussels blame game.
The main item on the agenda now is to design better social insurance, in order to minimize the pain from reallocation, be it from deregulation, technological progress, or globalization.
Of course, some product-market deregulation remains necessary, especially in the service sector.
The Bolkestein directive on services played badly, but there is no question that European consumers pay too much for many services.
To take just one example, eliminating the monopoly that notaries public hold in countries like France and Italy would substantially decrease the costs of buying and selling homes, decrease the cost of housing, and make it less costly for workers to move to where the jobs are.
European governments face three choices.
They can try to stop product market reforms altogether and, by the same token, try to stop trade liberalization and globalization.
So far, no government appears to have fallen to that temptation.
They also can continue to play the blame game, letting the Union pursue reforms, while complaining about Brussels bureaucrats.
But the anxiety now being felt across the EU shows the dangers of that strategy.
Moreover, labor-market policies do not fall under the EU mandate, so national governments will be on their own, without the Brussels bureaucrats to blame.
Finally, they can help “Brussels” define and design product-market reforms, and then sell those reforms, and the EU’s role in enacting them, to their voters.
If Europe’s leaders are wise enough to choose this course, the fiasco of the French and Dutch referendums will prove to have been useful after all.

Globalization Marches On
LONDON – In a recent symposium in the Financial Times on globalization’s prospects in 2011, the columnist Gideon Rachman observed that, “When Barack Obama visited India recently, the US President warned his hosts that the debate about globalization has reopened in the West,” and that “a backlash…is forming…and growing in advanced economies.”
But Rachman’s alarmism is misplaced.
The fear of globalization in the West is nothing new.
Articulate intellectuals and groups such as labor unions and environmental organizations in the advanced economies have voiced anti-globalization fears and sentiments for at least a quarter-century.
The fear of globalization, however, began historically in the East, not the West.
After World War II, the West dismantled barriers to trade and investment flows, and worked to eliminate exchange controls and move to currency convertibility.
What was sometimes called the liberal international economic order was the order of the day, and it was embraced by public opinion as well.
By contrast, the East generally embraced the fearful view that, as the Chilean sociologist Oswaldo Sunkel put it, integration into the international economy would lead to disintegration of the national economy.
Many intellectuals shared this dark anti-globalization vision, and policymakers in much of the East were not far behind.
Indeed, the West accepted the view that globalization would result (as with trade) in mutual gain, embracing what I called in 1997 the notion of “benign neglect.”
In the case of foreign investment and aid flows, the West went further, viewing them as being motivated by altruism, or “benign intent,” whereas the East regarded globalization in a world of poor and rich nations as implying “malign impact.”
In some analyses, malign impact turned into a more sinister “malign intent.” Thus, foreign aid was regarded as a plot to trap poor nations in a neo-colonial embrace.
What happened next was what I have called an “ironic reversal.”
As the benefits of globalization became manifest, and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident, policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake.
But then fear of globalization moved to the West.
The East had feared that it could not gain from trade with the West, which had superior infrastructure and human capital; now, the West had come to fear that it would lose from trade with the East, which had abundant, cheap labor.
The longstanding stagnation in wages for unskilled labor was attributed to low-cost, labor-intensive imports, ignoring the corollary that Western workers’ consumption of labor-intensive Asian goods offset the effect on real wages.
To take another example, the East worried about a “brain drain” of professionals to the West, where opportunities seemed to be more plentiful.
Today, the West is witnessing anti-globalization opposition from members of professional groups, who fear the loss of their jobs to foreign counterparts.
Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in “The Ballad of East and West”: “Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.” Given the ironic reversal of globalization fears, Kipling is still right: convergence has continued to elude East and West.
The current crisis did not create the debate about globalization now heard in the West; it only made it slightly more salient.
Yet the crisis may be tilting Western policy outcomes in favor of globalization.
For example, on trade, there has been a remarkable commitment to efforts – largely successful – to avoid significant backsliding into protectionism.
Moreover, the G-20 leaders have continued to express the need to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade-liberalization negotiations.
There are also initiatives such as the appointment by the governments of Britain, Germany, Indonesia, and Turkey of a High-Level Expert Trade Group, with Peter Sutherland, former Director General of GATT and the WTO, and myself as co-chairs.
The four governments will report at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos on how to conclude Doha this year.
In other words, Kipling could yet be proved wrong.
A reversal in the West is possible, perhaps even likely.
So the current crisis may thus, accidentally, establish a pro-globalization consensus that spans East and West.

Eurozone Chutzpah and the IMF
LONDON – Eurozone policymakers and politicians are in no doubt: they have done their part to support the currency union’s struggling members by increasing the size of its rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Now it is time for the rest of the world – that is, the International Monetary Fund – to step up and put additional funds on the table, and European finance ministers are making that case at the IMF/World Bank meetings in Washington
European officials, in other words, take for granted that the IMF should support the eurozone, as if the rest of the world had some kind of duty to do so.
In reality, even if eurozone governments could agree on a much larger increase in the ESM’s size, there are compelling reasons why the IMF should refrain from offering any further support. & & &
Europe’s leaders cannot decide if the eurozone is a federation akin to the United States or a group of independent states.
They frequently compare the eurozone favorably to other developed economies.
Eurozone members as a whole, they argue, have a lower budget deficit than the US and the United Kingdom, and a similar level of public debt.
Unlike the US and the UK, the eurozone in aggregate is running a current-account surplus (it is, as policymakers like to say, living “within its means”).
And they express considerable pride in the euro’s growing role as an international reserve currency, as well as resolve to do whatever it takes to defend the currency union’s integrity.
And yet the same policymakers believe that the rest of the world should bail out the eurozone.
When it suits them, the euro is no longer the currency of a highly successful and integrated economy, but a currency shared by a collection of sovereign creditor and debtor countries, and the IMF thus has a responsibility to support the debtor members.
That is an odd position to take, to say the least.
Imagine that the US federal government decided that it no longer wanted to support Mississippi and demanded support for that poor southern state from the IMF.
The rest of the world – led by the eurozone governments – would rightly turn their backs.
Similarly, the IMF is not expected to help India – whose per capita GDP is less than a tenth of eurozone levels – to finance the poverty-stricken states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
The eurozone wants it both ways.
Its debtors and creditors are all members of the same, wealthy currency union, whose current-account surplus with the rest of the world means that it is a net exporter of capital (that is, domestic savings exceed domestic investment).
Moreover, the eurozone’s strategy for dealing with the crisis implicitly relies on a rising surplus: member states with current-account deficits are under pressure to close them, but creditor countries face no pressure to reduce their surpluses.
So, a region that is essentially pursuing a mercantilist strategy now wants the rest of the world to finance it.
Many European leaders believe that the rest of the world owes the eurozone a bailout because the currency union is just an innocent bystander.
Despite being well run and fundamentally more stable than other economies, the markets (or “speculators”) are making it impossible for the eurozone’s struggling members to achieve the necessary adjustments.
So the eurozone deserves protection from international forces intent on destroying it.
This rationale highlights the core of the problem: the eurozone is institutionally incomplete, and eurozone policymakers continue to blame investors for pointing this out.
In every currency union, there are creditor and debtor regions.
Just as it is the responsibility of creditor regions in the world’s other currency unions to support the debtor regions (which they do through a variety of means), it is up to the eurozone’s creditor regions to underpin its debtor regions’ solvency.
This requires debt mutualization, fiscal transfers between member states, and, of course, federal institutions to give all of this legitimacy.
A second reason given by eurozone policymakers to justify their demand for more IMF support is basically a form of blackmail: the global consequences of a further eurozone crisis would be so grave that the IMF has no choice but to do whatever it can to prevent it.
Much poorer countries, and those routinely criticized by eurozone policymakers for their indebtedness (such as the US and the UK), should provide support to a wealthy creditor in order to prevent it from inflicting incalculable damage on the global economy.
This is akin to making the rest of the world an offer that it can’t refuse.
The rest of the world has no moral responsibility to support the eurozone, and it should resist European leaders’ efforts to extort that support, which would be tantamount to covert support for its creditor countries.
That would be an unjustified use of IMF resources, and would further confirm the suspicion among the world's emerging economies that the IMF is in thrall to Western interests.
The IMF should stick to supporting countries with temporary external-financing problems; a wealthy creditor region that refuses to address its institutional contradictions is not a deserving case.
If eurozone governments are unwilling to build the federal institutions needed to stabilize the eurozone, they should either assemble a big enough rescue fund themselves, or accept that the single currency is unworkable in its current form.

Cloning's Slippery Slope
Sometime in the next two years a human being will likely be cloned.
This may or may not bring shudders of horror, but will certainly not occur outside the law or in some shadowy offshore location.
The medical, scientific, legal and political establishment will fully support the effort.
This clone, however, will never leave the British laboratory in which it was created.
Last January, a form of human cloning called “therapeutic cloning” – or more properly “cell nuclear replacement” – was legalized in Britain.
As with in vitro fertilization, the British appear to have been the first to devise a regulatory scheme for morally contentious technology.
The world is watching what will happen next.
It is rather like a Woody Allen script, but run backwards.
In Allen's 1973 film Sleeper, attempts are made to clone Hitler from his preserved nose.
Today, instead of cloning people from spare parts – or spare cells, as is the case with reproductive cloning – scientists hope to grow those parts by cloning people.
The first part of this procedure is similar to that used to create Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal.
The nucleus from a human cell is inserted into an egg that had its nucleus removed.
An embryo forms, but it will not be implanted in a uterus.
Instead, embryonic stem cells will be derived from its inner cell mass.
These cells have the potential to become every cell-type in the body, a potential which may lead to cures for many chronic diseases.
Stem cells cannot become a baby.
While Britain has legalized therapeutic cloning, they are poised to ban reproductive cloning.
They oppose projects such as that of Drs. Severino Antinori of Rome and Panayiotis Zavos of Kentucky in America, who plan to enable infertile men to become fathers by inserting their DNA into an egg from their partner.
Reproductive cloning raises several moral issues – principally those of safety.
Scientists believe that human clones would have defects.
Because the egg that receives the new nucleus has to reprogram it quickly – teaching it to give the instructions necessary to construct an entire human being - genes that should be “turned on” might well be “turned off,” and vice versa.
This probably explains why at least some animal clones have problems with their hearts, lungs, and immune systems.
Weight is a problem too.
Dolly the sheep – although still going strong five years after her birth, and the mother of six (all conceived the old-fashioned way) – has always been plump.
During a trip to the Roslin Institute where Dolly was cloned, I found her, shorn of her fleece and revealing an ample midsection, mournfully staring from behind a sign that said, "hay only."
The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson is not the only British celebrity on a diet.
Being overweight is obvious. Other defects may be subtler and, perhaps, insignificant for farm animals.
But where humans are concerned, safety must come first.
Because the defects found in clones are not genetic mutations, pre-implantation diagnosis at the embryo stage will not reveal their existence.
Problems caused by these defects could emerge at any point in the person's life.
We would see a greater range of defects than we do in animals like mice because it is easier to analyze human behavior and physiology.
Therapeutic cloning would probably be safer than reproductive cloning because any reprogramming defects would not affect every cell in the body – just the cells used in therapy.
Thus far, only the UK has legalized therapeutic cloning.
A law passed late last year in Japan permits it but forbids transferring the embryo to the uterus. In March, Denmark’s Council of Ethics endorsed therapeutic cloning.
Will any country that legalizes therapeutic cloning inevitably slide down the so-called slippery slope and end up tolerating reproductive cloning?
The idea behind a slippery slope is that if you do x, which is acceptable, you will end up doing y, which is not.
Indeed, two types of slippery slopes – logical and sociological – exist.
On the logical slippery slope, you slide to the bottom and embrace the morally unacceptable because there is no way to distinguish it from an acceptable practice.
You can slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to the other – even if the two are conceptually different – just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to the other.
Therapeutic cloning is conceptually distinct from reproductive cloning.
Although the first step is the same, the intent behind the practices is not.
The former would be done in order to save lives by treating diseases now incurable – say, Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple sclerosis.
The latter – creating a person by cloning – would be done for reasons extending from egomania, to confusion between replication and resurrection, to the understandable desire to have a biologically related child.
Will therapeutic cloning make it more likely that people come to accept reproductive cloning?
I don't think so.
Therapeutic cloning is intended to heal the sick.
The cells created through cloning would be an extension of the patient: a means to treat him with cells generated by his own body.
It’s almost like donating a pint of blood for yourself in case you need it for subsequent surgery.
Even though I do not believe in a slippery slope from therapeutic to reproductive cloning, a society’s laws should give voice to its values.
In countries which allow for the former, it is probably a good idea to ban the latter.

Nigeria’s Sick Man Democracy
How sick is Nigerian president Umaru Yar’Adua?
In May, he admitted during a live television broadcast that he suffers from a kidney ailment, but sought to quell rumors that he was terminally ill by insisting that fears for his health are greatly exaggerated and politically motivated.
There are plenty of world leaders in less-than-perfect health.
But the stakes are especially high in Nigeria, where Yar’Adua embodies the country’s delicate political balance.
With the fall of Nigeria’s dictatorship and the introduction of democracy in 1999, governors in the mainly Muslim northern provinces believed they had struck a deal with their southern counterparts on a regional rotation of the country’s presidency.
In 2007, arguing that it was their turn to choose a chief executive, they bitterly opposed a bid by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo, a southerner and a Christian, to rewrite Nigeria’s constitution in hopes of winning a third term.
Southern governors countered that the north had controlled the country through more than three decades of authoritarian rule and that a southerner should hold the presidency for years to come.
Tensions mounted.
Once it became clear that his gambit would fail, Obasanjo found a compromise: he named a man he trusted, Yar’Adua, a little-known northern governor and devout Muslim, as his preferred successor. In April 2007, Yar’Adua won a disputed landslide presidential victory.
Western and African observers charged that widespread vote-rigging had tainted the official result, and Nigeria’s Supreme Court has yet to rule on challenges to the election’s legality.
But Yar’Adua shrugged off charges of electoral fraud, and in the first days of his presidency, he drew praise, both at home and abroad, for promises to tackle corruption and pursue an agreement with militia groups in the oil-rich, violence-plagued Niger Delta region.
In reaching out to armed groups like the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), one of his primary assets has been his vice president, Goodluck Jonathan, a native of the area.
Pacifying the Delta is vitally important, because Nigeria, the world’s eighth-largest oil producer, earns 86% of its export revenue from oil.
Attacks on pipelines have recently intensified ahead of a planned summit meeting between the government and various militia leaders, as small groups of militants stage attacks on oil infrastructure in the Delta to establish their relevance and win a potentially lucrative seat at the negotiating table.
The summit is likely to generate an agreement and positive media coverage, but northern Muslim members of parliament could complicate efforts to implement the deal.
The Nigerian government could use some good news.
Electricity shortages have intensified on Yar’Adua’s watch, producing blackouts in many areas of the country and darkening the foreign investment climate.
Rising food and energy prices pushed inflation up to 9.7% in May, from 8.2% in April.
Corruption investigations launched by Yar’Adua’s government have uncovered broader and deeper problems than many knew existed.
A battle between the president and legislature over control of federal spending has not been fully resolved.
For foreign investors, the greatest near-term concern may be a broad range of attacks from parliament and some of Yar’Adua’s economic advisors on Charles Soludo, the central bank governor, who is widely credited for Nigeria’s improved economic performance in the past several years.
Under Obasanjo, Soludo initiated much needed banking reforms and argued strenuously that Nigeria should pay its foreign debt.
But Soludo’s recent decision to create a sovereign wealth fund has ignited a firestorm.
Lawmakers complain they weren’t consulted.
Northern Muslims wonder why Soludo, a southern Christian, believes the government should horde excess cash that could be spent to relieve poverty among their constituents.
A favorite of the West, Soludo may not survive the year.
With so many challenges ahead, Nigeria can ill afford an ailing president.
Yar’Adua insists that he’s fine and that his trips to Germany for medical treatment, during the election campaign last year and again this April, have been unfairly politicized.
But there are plenty of unanswered questions about his kidney condition and rumors that he may even have Churg-Strauss Syndrome, a life-threatening autoimmune disease.
The true state of his health may matter less than public fears that he’s hiding something.
Yar’Adua’s health worries are creating risks to Nigeria’s stability that run far beyond questions about the Niger Delta or any single political issue.
If Yar’Adua were to die in office, his vice president would succeed him – returning the presidency to a southern Christian.
Nigeria’s northern Muslims are highly unlikely to accept that result without protest.
There is no reason to believe that Goodluck Jonathan will preemptively resign, and removing him from office if he assumes the presidency might well stoke unprecedented violence in the Delta.
Given the political friction and violence generated by last year’s election campaign, new balloting would prove a less-than-appealing prospect.
Only Umaru Yar’Adua’s doctors know for sure how sick he is.
But as answers begin to emerge, we will learn much more about the health of Nigeria’s fragile democracy.

Pardons Are a Loaded Gun
NEW YORK – Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was convicted of contempt of court for defying a federal judge’s order to stop racially profiling and arbitrarily detaining Latinos in the name of catching illegal immigrants, is no stranger to controversy.
But it is US President Donald Trump’s recent pardon of Arpaio that currently is spurring heated debate, as it raises fundamental questions about the presidential pardon power that has been a part of US policymaking from the country’s birth.
In a monarchy, a king may have the power to forgive citizens’ crimes virtually without limit.
In the US Constitution – Article II, Section 2 – America’s founders gave a similar power to the president, but with two key limitations.
One is rooted in separation of powers: it could not be used in cases of impeachment, an issue that is handled by Congress.
The other is rooted in federalism: it could be used only for crimes “against the United States,” or federal crimes, not crimes prosecuted by one of the 50 US states.
The granting of the pardon power reflected concerns among the US Constitution’s framers that the criminal code would be applied in a draconian manner, producing a surfeit of punishment.
As Alexander Hamilton put it in Federalist 74, “The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.”
The power to pardon, Hamilton continued, ought to be exercised by one person, because a single person “would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for the mitigation of the rigor of the law.”
What the founders do not address is what happens when that one person has something other than justice on his mind.
During Arpaio’s 24 years as the sheriff of a jurisdiction that includes the rapidly growing city of Phoenix, he built his reputation on his department’s aggressive efforts to track down undocumented immigrants – and on the brutal conditions he established in the facilities where they were held.
Arpaio was directly responsible for detaining thousands of people without any reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration law.
It was enough that they looked Latino.
That behavior made Arpaio the subject of lawsuits that, from 1993 to 2015, cost $142 million to settle.
Trump and Arpaio are longtime allies.
During Barack Obama’s presidency, both were prominent figures in the racist “birther” movement that insisted Obama was born outside the US, and therefore was not entitled to be president.
During Trump’s presidential campaign, Arpaio was a poster child of the divisive immigration debate and a vocal supporter of the candidate’s extreme promises, including the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico.
Against this background, Trump’s pardon of Arpaio looks like sheer political opportunism.
It certainly was not a moral act of clemency.
After all, Arpaio’s conduct hardly qualifies as “unfortunate guilt.”
He reveled in his law-breaking, has shown no remorse for it, has never signaled an understanding of the grace of mercy.
And, given that he was not to be sentenced until October, one cannot argue that he faced draconian punishment (a key concern for America’s founders).
The US Constitution’s framers envisioned another key purpose for the pardon power: to help end conflicts and reconcile with political foes.
In Hamilton’s words, “there are often critical moments when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth.”
In 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued full pardons for Confederates – with the exception of their leaders and subject to conditions “he may deem expedient for the public welfare” – in order to help reunite the country after the Civil War.
Even Gerald Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon, who had resigned from the presidency over the Watergate scandal, was couched in terms of national healing.
Recalling the ways in which the pardon power has been used in the past highlights the perversity of the Arpaio affair and its singular reactionary purpose: to denigrate and, where possible, reverse Obama’s achievements and, indeed, his values.
In Trump’s hands, a constitutional power intended to mitigate the “necessary severity” of criminal justice was deployed to sanction cruelty by a sworn officer of the law.
Unsurprisingly, given its purely ideological basis, Arpaio’s pardon was not reviewed in advance by the US Department of Justice, as has become customary over the years.
Indeed, the DOJ rushed to distance itself from the decision, highlighting how easily Trump can use (or not use) the pardon power to settle his many scores: it is virtually the only power within the criminal justice system that the president can exercise unilaterally.
To be sure, Trump’s pardon of Arpaio has not created a legal basis for impunity; the pardon power’s constitutional limitations prevent that.
But a serious problem will arise if Trump attempts to use it to protect his family – not a farfetched scenario, given pending FBI investigations into his inner circle’s dealings with Russia.
Such a move would be met with a potential legal challenge, based on the impeachment clause or other constitutional limits.
The pardon power is like a loaded gun.
In the hands of a leader who possesses wisdom and good character, it can strengthen the rule of law.
But, in the hands of an unstable, vengeful narcissist, it can cause profound damage.

Defusing the Russia-Ukraine Crisis
NEW YORK – In recent months, Russia has positioned a large and capable military force along its border with Ukraine.
What we do not know is why (capabilities are always easier to gauge than intentions), or even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided on a course of action.
Thus far, he has created options, not outcomes.
What comes to mind is July 1990, when another autocrat, Saddam Hussein, positioned sizable military forces along Iraq’s southern border with Kuwait.
Then, as now, intentions were murky but the imbalance of forces was obvious.
Arab leaders told then-US President George H.W. Bush not to overreact, convinced it was a ploy to compel Kuwait to take steps to increase the price of oil, which would help Iraq recover and rearm after its long war with Iran.
By early August, though, what to many had looked like political theater had become all too real.
Invasion led to conquest, and it took a massive international coalition led by the United States to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restore the country’s sovereignty.
Could a similar dynamic be playing out today on the Russia-Ukraine border?
US President Joe Biden’s administration has reacted to Russia’s troop buildup with a mix of honey and vinegar.
The objective is to persuade Russia not to invade by making clear that the costs would outweigh any benefits and that some Russian concerns could be addressed, at least in part, if it backed off.
Call it deterrence mixed with diplomacy.
Some have criticized the US response as too weak.
But geography and military balance make direct defense of Ukraine all but impossible.
Biden was right to take direct US military intervention off the table: not acting on such a threat would only reinforce mounting doubts as to America’s reliability.
But Biden is also right to push back against Russia.
The US and the United Kingdom, along with Russia itself, provided assurances to Ukraine in 1994 that, in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal it had inherited from the Soviet Union, its sovereignty and borders would be respected.
This did not constitute a NATO-like security commitment, but it did imply that Ukraine would not be abandoned.
And yet some who oppose direct resistance of Russian aggression against Ukraine support it in the case of possible Chinese aggression against Taiwan.
In both instances, geography works against US military options, and in neither is the US bound by an ironclad security commitment.
But in the case of Ukraine, NATO allies are not prepared to defend against a Russian attack and are not expecting the US to do so.
By contrast, US allies and partners are prepared to resist Chinese aggression and expect that the US would help frustrate any Chinese bid for regional hegemony.
This does not mean Russia should have a free hand versus Ukraine.
Whatever order does exist in the world is premised on the principle that no country is permitted to invade another and change borders by force.
This more than justifies providing Ukraine with arms to defend itself, as well as threatening to impose severe economic sanctions that would exact a significant cost on Russia’s already fragile, energy-dependent economy.
Biden is also right to offer a diplomatic path for Putin if he decides it would be wiser to walk back from the brink.
Several worthy ideas have been suggested: stepped-up US diplomatic participation in the Minsk diplomatic process initiated in the wake of Russia’s intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014, a mutual pull-back of Russian and Ukrainian forces from their shared border, and a willingness to discuss with Russia the architecture of European security.
The Biden administration is also right to limit what it offers to Putin.
It is one thing not to bring Ukraine into NATO now; it would be quite another to rule it out permanently.
The same holds for any assurances that might be extended to Russia about other NATO policies.
Diplomacy should never be confused with capitulation.
At the end of the day, what comes next is Putin’s decision to make.
He sees Ukraine as an organic part of greater Russia, and may well seek its incorporation to cement his legacy and reverse – at least partly – the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he described in 2005 as “a major geopolitical disaster of the century.”
One hopes that a policy of raising the costs of invading and offering some face-saving gestures will convince Putin to defuse the crisis he has created.
If, however, deterrence fails and Putin does invade, promised sanctions will have to be introduced.
That includes scrapping the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and imposing real costs on Russian financial institutions and Putin’s inner circle.
It would be a moment, too, to strengthen NATO and provide Ukraine with additional arms, advice, and intelligence.
This brings me back to Iraq, but now in 2003 and the following years.
The US invaded out of a concern that Saddam was hiding weapons of mass destruction and because it saw an opportunity to spread democracy, not just to Iraq but throughout the Arab world.
But while the war began with a massive “shock and awe” air campaign and the rapid fall of Baghdad, consolidating military advances proved to be both difficult and costly as urban-based groups provided stiff opposition to US-led troops.
The American people turned against the war and a foreign policy judged to be overly ambitious and enormously expensive.
A similar fate could await Russia should its troops march on Kyiv and try to control most or all of Ukraine.
Here, too, consolidating control in the face of widespread, heavily-armed resistance could prove extremely difficult.
Large numbers of Russian soldiers would return home in body bags as they did from Afghanistan following the 1979 Soviet intervention.
A decade later, Soviet troops were gone from that country, as were the Soviet leaders associated with the invasion.
The Soviet Union itself disintegrated.
Putin would be wise to reckon with the lessons of this past before deciding on the future.

The Open Secret of Development Economics
BEIJING – This year’s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences recognizes Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer for their work using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in developmental studies.
This year’s selection has elicited a broad array of reactions from around the world, not least because RCTs are a source of controversy among academic economists.
To many in China, the Nobel Committee seems once again to have missed the Chinese development experience, which, after all, had nothing to do with RCTs.
To be sure, some of this criticism amounts to sour grapes.
The Nobel Prize has been awarded to only three Chinese nationals – for literature, medicine, and peace – since its inception.
Nonetheless, China’s economic history offers important lessons that today’s RCT-driven approach to development research has missed.
Researchers in the field seem to have forgotten the wisdom imparted by the classical development economists of the 1950s: economic development is about taking the difficult but necessary steps to achieve sustained growth.
For example, increasing domestic savings is very difficult, but imperative.
Classical development economists such as Pei-Kang Chang, Roy F. Harrod, Evsey Domar, and Robert Solow saw that savings are essential for jump-starting economic growth in a poor country.
Their central insight was mostly intuitive: even subsistence farmers know that improving one’s life in the future requires saving some money in the present, in order to purchase another piece of land or better equipment with which to improve one’s current plot.
But in the 1970s, savings from oil-rich countries and Japan flooded global financial markets, and gave rise to a new idea. Thenceforth, it was assumed that developing countries could simply rely on international borrowing to accumulate domestic capital.
Despite the severe losses suffered by the heaviest borrowers, particularly in Latin America, this idea has lingered on.
Yet for its part, China launched an effort to accumulate capital through domestic saving starting in the early 1950s.
Despite being one of the world’s poorest countries, China’s national saving rate never fell below 20% of GDP before 1978.
And after that, its national saving rate increased in most of the years leading up to 2008, reaching a peak of 52% of GDP in that year.
For a country to make full use of domestic savings, it must develop its own manufacturing capacity.
As Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding leader, famously observed: “No country has become a major economy without becoming an industrial power.” But building manufacturing capacity is hard: it often requires a country to start with “dirty jobs,” while encouraging tireless entrepreneurship.
China has done both.
It began with labor-intensive exports, and gradually developed the most complete production network in the world; and it now ranks among the countries with the largest number of entrepreneurs globally.
Yet, since the 1990s, very few development economists have studied how countries can industrialize and produce their own entrepreneurs.
Likewise, today’s development economics has largely missed how society-wide coordination can capture scale economies of production over time.
While classical economists such as Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, Albert O. Hirschman, and Alexander Gerschenkron had systematic and convincing theories to explain the mechanism, the prevailing neoclassical Arrow-Debreu model cannot account for increasing returns.
Practically speaking, economic coordination tends to require government action.
When the four East Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) attracted worldwide attention in the late 1980s, their rapid growth invited a lively debate about the proper role of government in economic development, giving rise to the notion of a “developmental state.”
But the 1997 Asian financial crisis raised serious doubts about the Asian model, and development economics has since reverted to the neoclassical paradigm.
In China’s case, government has played an obvious role, but it should not be credited with all of the country’s success.
Government intervention has proved most effective when it has mirrored that of other East Asian economies: helping with the accumulation of production capacity and providing coordination when needed.
It is unfortunate that China’s economic success is so often viewed as a harbinger of an entirely new development approach: “state capitalism.”
In any case, there is much that RCTs and contemporary development economics have missed.
Experiments might help policymakers improve existing welfare programs or lay the foundation for new ones, but they cannot tell a poor country how to achieve sustained growth.
As the old Chinese saying goes, “Giving people fishing nets is better than giving them fish.”
There is no secret to China’s economic success.
It has simply followed the advice of classical economists, taking the difficult steps that are necessary for progress over the long term.
One doesn’t need an experiment to identify those steps; they are the same for all developing economies, and they have been known for decades.

The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Throughout the so-called “war on terror,” the notion of a “clash of civilization” between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
Instead, the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict “within” a particular civilization, namely Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious, and easily summarized: democratization.
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the “Greater Middle-East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of the United States, as the most powerful and moral nation, to bring about that necessary change.
The status quo was untenable.
Implementing democracy, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Today, Iraq may be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity.
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a “clash of civilizations,” we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.
There is a clash within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries, risks causing regional destabilization.
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West, but between the secularized world and a growing religious one.
At an even deeper and atavistic level, there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak, as some are doing, of a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In reality, we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion, which runs between the West (with the US being a complicated exception) and much of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), but particularly the Islamic world.
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual’s identity within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples’ daily lives.
In some ways, “they” are our own buried past and, with a combination of ignorance, prejudice, and, above all, fear, “we” are afraid that “they” could define our future.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
They have tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, from communism to capitalism.
Since everything has failed, why not give God a chance?
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts, but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege – and, paradoxically, the virtue – of ignorance.
We all see how others feel and react, but without the minimal historical and cultural tools necessary to decipher those reactions.
Globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions – and of ignorance.
This clash of emotions is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.
From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.
It has become an obsession.
It is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.
In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny.
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), Israel’s strength and resilience is a direct consequence of their own weakness, divisions, and corruption.
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda, but they do not oppose it with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
Here, perhaps, is the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim, particularly Arab, culture of humiliation.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it.
But that will be difficult, for transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the “other” that neither side may yet be ready to undertake.

Winning the War on Tuberculosis
JOHANNESBURG – The world is finally waking up to the threat posed by one of the most overlooked diseases of our time.
Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted the first-ever high-level meeting on tuberculosis (TB) to explore options for international eradication efforts.
But, as welcome as this new global focus is, the fact remains that the road to beating TB begins in Africa.
Simply put, TB remains one of the deadliest epidemics in Africa today, and one-quarter of all TB deaths worldwide occur there.
In 2016, some 417,000 people on the continent succumbed to the disease.
Recent outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB in South Africa, Mozambique, and Ghana could push the annual death toll even higher.
These pockets of the bacterium, now completely immune to antimicrobial treatment, mean that the challenge of global eradication has become even more daunting.
Part of the reason for TB’s persistence is the vulnerability of the populations it infects.
For starters, TB is among the leading killers of HIV-positive people, claiming some 40% of those who die from HIV.
This poses dangers for non-HIV patients as well, especially those with suppressed immune systems, young children, and infants.
Eradication is also difficult because TB is a highly contagious airborne bacterium; people living and working in close quarters – such as miners, prisoners, migrants, and refugees – suffer the highest rates of infection.
Finally, because TB prevalence is closely linked to poverty and social marginalization, reaching those most at risk is not always easy.
Infectious diseases have no borders, and as African countries deepen their trade ties and intra-Africa migration grows, the threat of regional pandemics will only increase.
This makes it all the more critical that Africa begin developing a multi-sector, integrated approach to containing, controlling, and eventually eradicating public-health challenges like TB.
To this end, one approach that African governments could emulate is the TB management strategy in place for the continent’s mining sector, an inter-agency plan devised in 2014 by the Southern African Development Community.
Although this so-called “harmonized” approach applies to a commercial industry, its focus on coordinating with the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) – African Union states grouped for economic integration – could serve as a model for more effective collective action on TB containment.
But before a specific framework can be agreed upon, three issues require urgent attention. First, African health-care planners and disease specialists must set country, regional, and local containment targets.
For example, setting goals for reductions in new TB infections would enable health officials to measure more accurately the impact of their strategies.
Moreover, to end TB completely, Africa will need new and sustained financial commitments from the public and private sectors.
And, finally, disease-control strategies must be designed to support the economic and health-care priorities of the RECs.
At the moment, most state and regional health-care systems lack funding and human resources.
African policymakers must therefore develop systems for prevention, diagnosis, and care that help governments share the disease burden and ensure that treatment protocols are consistent across regions.
To be sure, there are some positive trends in the fight against TB.
Global infection rates are falling by about 2% annually, and even African countries hit by TB still managed a 4% decline in infections from 2013 to 2017.
And, with organizations like the World Health Organization and the African Union beginning to produce roadmaps for TB eradication, it is clear that momentum is steadily building.
Still, sustaining this progress in Africa will require significant regional coordination, not to mention a lot more money.
Most vaccines and medications are currently too expensive for the majority of Africans.
But even those lucky enough to obtain treatment – usually a six- to eight-month course of powerful antibiotics – still face a 20% chance of relapse.
The goal of eradicating TB is within reach; the recent gathering at the UNGA marked a critical turning point in the world’s war on the disease.
But even as commitments are made and declarations signed, we must remember that in Africa, the battle is far from over.

Islam's Reformist Tradition
The "clash of civilizations" supposedly underway between the West and the Muslim world, which many see as manifested in Iraq, as well as in Saudi Arabia's growing violence, in fact masks other conflicts - disputes that will probably prove to be far more significant in the long term.
One of these struggles is taking place among Muslims themselves over the shape of reform within their own societies.
The Muslim reformist tradition - the search for an authentic path that links Islam's traditions to the modern world - has deep roots, stretching back to the middle of the 19th century.
Back then, Muslim thinkers contrasted the decline of their own societies with Europe's dynamism, a particularly painful distinction in light of European successes in colonizing large parts of the Muslim world.
Then, too, Muslim intellectuals focused on the "decadence" of Muslim societies, their debilitating political and social corruption.
Many early Muslim reformists were clerics or senior bureaucrats, who had seen first hand how diminished their societies had become.
More importantly, they were members of a tiny minority that had been educated in the written heritage of Islam.
Far beyond Koranic recitation, these men aspired to participate in the centuries-long discussions among Muslim scholars about the proper ordering of Muslim life.
This training enabled them to compare the debased state of affairs of their time with the norms and aspirations of earlier generations of clerics and thinkers.
Their judgment was clear: Muslims had sunk far below what their religion required them to be, and lagged far behind the accomplishments of their ancestors.
For the reformers, normality meant the progressive development of Muslim societies, and they tied this to the interaction of Islamic teaching with relevant, worldly ideas of the time.
So these first reformers sought to engage with the ideas that they saw emerging from Europe: rationality, tolerance and ethically determined behavior.
These early reformers, among them Muhammad Abduh and Jamaleddin al-Afghani, did not ignite the mass mobilization they hoped for, and were not able to redress social ills through better implementation of religious prescriptions.
But their influence was powerful and lasting, and extended in directions that they could not have anticipated.
The paradox here is that the open-minded reformism they espoused helped stir conservative trends among Islamic thinkers, who seized on the reformists' revival of Islamic norms to urge a return to the "purity" of the first Islamic societies.
This conservative trend did not follow-up on the reformists' engagement with the modern ideas of the European Enlightenment, arguing instead that these represented a further estrangement from authentic Islamic values.
Thus, the most lasting effect of the first reformist wave was the establishment of a " salafi " (traditionalist) trend and eventually the emergence of an even more radical fundamentalism.
Both conservative traditionalists and radical fundamentalists were drawn to political activism and came to regard the modern state as a means to liberate Muslims from foreign domination and to re-Islamicize society through a revival of Islam's original norms.
Today, we can see the force of this ideology, but it would be a mistake to assume that the spirit of the original Muslim reformists has vanished.
Out of the spotlight, countless Muslim scholars and academics have continued to probe the connections between Islamic thought and modern values.
Drawing on critical scholarship in history and theology, they have detailed the ways in which Muslims have changed - and continue to change - their traditions, in different times and places.
Thus, a sharp, focused challenge to the assertions of religious orthodoxy has emerged in the work of such important thinkers as Abdolkarim Soroush (Iran), Abdelmajid Charfi (Tunisia), Fazlur Rahman (Pakistan), and Mahmud Muhammad Taha (Sudan).
While their work encounters great resistance from traditionalist and fundamentalist circles (whose views are widely covered in mainstream Muslim and Western media), these contemporary reformers - and the questions they have raised - have had a big impact on a rising generation of Muslim intellectuals around the world.
Of course, listeners must strain to hear the voices of reformists amidst the din of those calling for resistance to the enemy and a return to the pure sources of Islam.
However, the seeds of a new wave of "reform" have taken root, and await an early thaw to sprout.
The reformists of the first wave attempted to "reopen the doors of Ijtihad (religious interpretation)" in order to adapt the inherited systems of Islamic thinking to new conditions.
Today's reformists are subjecting these traditional frameworks to scrutiny and attempting to separate the core ethical principles of Islam from the various historical adaptations that conservatives have enshrined as sacred.
Adapting Islam to modern conditions was the purpose of the first generation of reformers.
By engaging fully with the main currents of modern thinking, their contemporary successors seek to better understand how universal principles can be expressed through Muslim tradition.

Free Trade Ad Nauseam
NEW YORK – So much has been written, by so many, against the muddled ideas that have now overwhelmed good sense on trade policy in the United States government that one wonders whether there is anything left to say.
Yet it is worth recalling what Pierre-Joseph Proudhon reportedly told the Russian intellectual Alexander Herzen: “And do you imagine that once a thing has been said, it is enough?....It has to be dinned into people, it has to be repeated over and over again.”
What we need now is a primer on the major misconceptions in the hope that, unlike Gresham’s Law, which says that bad money drives out good money, good economics will drive out bad economics.
Four, in particular need to be corrected.
The first misconception is that exports create jobs, while imports do not – a fallacy that the great trade economist Harry Johnson traced to mercantilism, and which the US has resurrected.
In fact, in a world where parts and components come from everywhere, interference with imports imperils competitiveness.
The success of parcel-delivery companies, for example, depends on imports, which must be brought from the borders inland, as well as on exports.
Second, the credo “Trade, not aid” has given way to the mistaken belief that trade matters less than foreign assistance.
The labor constituency, ever fearful of import competition, has undermined trade policy.
It has also shifted aid policy in directions that assign priority to areas where the returns to US efforts are relatively minuscule.
Thus, the US State Department has ceased being an advocate of multilateral trade liberalization, despite decades of massive gains from the removal of trade barriers.
Instead, its aid arm, the US Agency for International Development, has now retreated into low-yield programs conceived as randomized experiments.
That technique impresses Bill Gates, and the new USAID administrator, Rajiv Shah, has experience with it.
But, even if all such programs succeeded, their benefits would not add up to a fraction of the documented gains that have accrued from trade and other macro-level policies in which the US has lost interest.
Third, many believe that manufactures deserve preferential support.
This is practically the mantra of US President Barack Obama’s administration, and it has cost him the support not only of much of the economics profession, but also of Christina Romer, who chaired his Council of Economic Advisers.
In a recent newspaper commentary, she refuted virtually all of the arguments advanced by manufacturing lobbyists for special treatment.
Add to the critiques that of Nobel laureate Robert Solow, a staunch supporter of Obama’s Democratic Party.
He agrees that there are activities that yield higher social returns than private returns.
The problem, he notes, is that neither he nor anyone else can possibly know which ones they are, whereas the lobbyists claim that they know this precisely.
Proponents of a “manufacturing first” policy argue that “clusters” of businesses are more productive than individual businesses are.
But big clustering effects are hard to find.
The economists Glenn Ellison and Edward Glaeser have found that clustering is only marginally greater than if businesses are allocated randomly.
Besides, it is hard not to accept that, in the economist Frances Cairncross’s famous words, we are increasingly seeing the “death of distance.”
Finally, the financial sector has come to be viewed as the bane of morality.
In a world of financial fraud and insider trading, it is easy enough to believe this, and to accept that the financial sector must be taxed.
But morality cuts across sectors.
There are plenty of honest people in all walks of life, and crooks as well.
The quasi-Marxist view that our morality stems from our economic position overlooks the moralizing role of family, religion, culture, and art.
Given these misconceptions, protectionism has re-emerged as a formidable foe.
In 1999, when the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization erupted into bomb threats and mayhem, I asked then-Director-General Mike Moore whether we ought not to be prepared to die for the great cause of free trade.
I should have said: we ought at least to be prepared to live for it.
Between old and new muddle, and the certain prospect that the demolition of each bad idea merely allows others to take root and grow in its place, the task of the free trader is never finished.

Renewing Europe’s Security Dialogue
ATHENS – The year 2009 has been one of great change, taking place amidst even greater uncertainty.
Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the resilience of the post-Cold War security system in Europe is being tested.
Longstanding conflicts remain unresolved and complex new challenges are emerging.
Energy security, organized crime, terrorism, absolutism and fundamentalism, climate change, and cybercrime are acute concerns for every country.
The economic crisis has left many people far less prosperous, and perhaps less inclined to be ambitious in our efforts to address Europe’s security challenges.
But we must also keep in mind that crisis brings with it opportunities for change.
This year has also seen a number of positive developments, including a “reset” in relations between two key players in the European security dialogue: Russia and the United States.
The European Union has recently taken important steps towards greater cohesion and unity with the appointment of a President and High Representative for Foreign Affairs.
We should celebrate these achievements even as we recognize that serious problems remain to be resolved.
There are different perspectives on how Europe’s security architecture should be designed, but we all agree on the urgent need to tackle this critical challenge through constructive dialogue.
It is in this spirit of cooperation and bridge-building that 56 foreign ministers – representing the US, Canada, and European countries, including the Russian Federation and the rest of the former Soviet Union – will meet in Athens on December 1-2 on my invitation to discuss the future of European security.
The talks mark the continuation of the “Corfu Process,” anchored in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which began with an informal ministerial meeting on Corfu in June.
An attempt to address Europe’s unfinished business, the Corfu Process is an opportunity for us to come together to assess the gaps in our common security, to craft more effective responses to existing challenges, and – most importantly – to generate new political will for joint action.
This includes action to preserve arms-control regimes, including the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe; to accelerate the resolution of protracted conflicts; to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to assess and address traditional and new threats.
We cannot afford to leave the region’s protracted conflicts such as the ones in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria on the back burner, as last year’s war in Georgia made abundantly clear.
People living in these areas need peace and stability, not a fragile status quo that could suddenly shatter and turn violent.
Security challenges in neighboring regions also require a joint response.
Afghanistan is a case in point.
And threats like terrorism, trafficking of arms, drugs, and people, and climate change are borderless and complex.
Only a joint response can be effective.
The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of an era of mistrust and division, and opened the way for cooperation aimed at a peaceful and stable Europe.
Europe has come a long way from those years of division, but we have not yet fully reaped the benefits promised by the wave of change of 1989.
The OSCE meeting in Athens comes at a critical time, when Europeans must move into the twenty-first century more united than ever before.
We must take this opportunity to restore the full capacity of the OSCE and make a fresh commitment to an indivisible European security system.

The Trouble with Europe
NEW YORK – According to the latest opinion polls, the big winners in the European Parliament election later this month will be right-wing populist parties that share a common loathing of the European Union, most notably the National Front in France, the Freedom Party in the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom’s Independence Party.
Though the Euroskeptic right may not win a majority of seats, its collective strength is a blow to the cause of European unity.
Why is a project that began with such high hopes in the wake of World War II running into so much resistance?
The success of right-wing populism in Europe stems not only from unease with the EU, but also from a surge of resentment against liberal/left elites, who are blamed for many sources of anxiety: immigration, squeezed economies, Islamic extremism, and, of course, the alleged domination of the “Eurocracy” in Brussels.
As is true of Tea Party voters in the United States, some Europeans claim that their countries have been taken away from them.
People feel politically helpless in a world that seems to be increasingly ruled by big corporations and faceless international bureaucracies.
The appeal of populism is its claim that things would surely get better if only we could be masters of our own homes again.
What has broken down in many countries is not just confidence in European institutions, but the underlying liberal/left consensus that emerged from the catastrophe of two world wars.
After 1945, Christian and Social Democrats shared an ideal of a peaceful, united Europe, with continental solidarity – a commitment to economic equality, the welfare state, and multiculturalism – gradually replacing nationalism.
This ideological edifice began to be seriously dented in the 1990’s, after the collapse of the Soviet empire discredited not only socialism, but any form of collective idealism.
Neo-liberalism began to fill the vacuum.
At the same time, more and more immigrants, often from Muslim-majority countries, settled in European cities, resulting in social tensions, to which mainstream parties were unable to respond adequately.
Warnings about racism, or “xenophobia,” were no longer convincing in an atmosphere of economic decline and sporadic terrorism.
That is why populist demagogues – with their promises to defend Western civilization against Islam, fight “Brussels,” and “take back” their countries from the leftist elites – have done so well.
But this reaction will hardly help European countries thrive.
To compete with rising powers on other continents, a common European foreign and defense policy will become increasingly important.
And a shared currency, however flawed its conception, demands common financial institutions, which will be impossible to establish and sustain unless Europeans regain their sense of solidarity.
The question is how?
What, for example, can convince relatively wealthy northern Europeans, especially in Germany, that their tax money should be used to help southern Europeans in times of crisis?
Unfortunately, pan-national movements do not have a good track record of nurturing a common sense of belonging.
They are either too muddled (pan-Arabism), too dangerous (pan-Germanism), or both (pan-Asianism).
Most of the founders of pan-European institutions, such as Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Jean Monnet, were Catholics.
Pan-Europeanism comes more naturally to Catholics than to Protestants, because they have traditionally found a sense of belonging in the Roman Church, which often coincided with the idea of Europe.
Those who created the European Economic Community in 1957 were, in some ways, the heirs of the Holy Roman Empire.
But this cannot be the model for Europe, whose citizens include members of almost all faiths, as well as many who claim no religious adherence at all.
The kind of ethnic solidarity that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to whip up in the former Soviet empire is certainly not the answer for Europe, either.
Ethnic nationalism became a toxic political strategy in the twentieth century, leading to genocide and ethnic cleansing – a legacy that suggests how dangerous Putin’s enterprise is.
In any case, Europeans never were ethnically united, and never will be.
Some European leaders, such as former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, dream of a European cultural community.
Verhofstadt speaks of his love of French wine, German opera, and English and Italian literature.
All have their attractions, no doubt, but will hardly suffice to unite Europeans in a political or economic sense.
The only thing left, then, would be a kind of social contract.
European citizens should not be enticed to give up a degree of national sovereignty on religious, cultural, or ethnic grounds.
Nor should they be asked to devote some of their taxes to helping other countries out of love and reverence for European flags or anthems.
They should be persuaded that it is in their self-interest to do these things.
People would have to be told by their national leaders that some problems can be addressed only by pan-national institutions.
Will they be convinced?
This question goes back to the old debates of the Enlightenment: John Locke’s social contract, based on enlightened self-interest, versus David Hume’s view that tradition and cultural prejudice are the essential glue of society.
My sympathies are with the former.
But history has shown that the latter may have the stronger pull.
Then again, history has also shown that traditions are often invented to serve the interests of ruling classes.
This has been the problem of European unification: it was always a venture driven by members of a political and bureaucratic elite.
Ordinary people were only rarely consulted.
And now the populists are reaping the benefit.

Staying on Track to End Malaria
BASEL – Ending an epidemic is a marathon undertaking, and in the case of malaria, we are nearing the finish line.
But we will need to keep up the momentum.
Over the past few decades, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector have broken new ground in the science of treating malaria, and have channeled extraordinary resources toward the cause.
The investments have paid off: the global malaria mortality rate fell by 60% between 2000 and 2015.
Still, mounting challenges such as drug and insecticide resistance threaten to reverse the progress we have made.
For two consecutive years now, malaria deaths have risen, while funding has flatlined.
This year’s World Malaria Day (April 25) should thus spur a redoubling of our efforts.
Eradicating malaria will require new medical and health-policy solutions as well as stronger political will.
My company, Novartis, has been active in Africa for the past two decades, providing antimalarials and working with governments to support health-care systems.
During that time, we have learned that we need more first-hand information from malaria experts operating on the front lines of the fight.
To that end, we commissioned the study Malaria Futures for Africa, co-chaired by Richard Kamwi, ambassador of the intergovernmental organization Eliminate 8, and Bob Snow of the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust program and the University of Oxford.
The study compiles advice from ministers of health, heads of national malaria control programs, academics, and community leaders across 14 African countries, all of whom offer critical insights about important challenges and opportunities in the fight against the disease.
One of the study’s clearest takeaways is that we need to arm ourselves against the rising threat of drug and insecticide resistance by investing in research and development for next-generation antimalarial treatments.
Malaria-bearing mosquitoes have developed a resistance to commonly used insecticides in 61 countries around the world.
And in Southeast Asia, some strains of the malaria parasite itself have begun to develop a resistance to artemisinin, the basic component in standard treatments.
Without a concerted response from the global health community, drug-resistant strains of malaria could spread to Africa and cause more than 100,000 new deaths per year.
To avert this outcome, we must invest more in innovative public-private partnerships like GAVI, the Medicines for Malaria Venture, and the Wellcome Trust, all of which are working to develop new prevention and treatment tools.
Another key insight from the study is that we need to make better use of the tools we already have.
A child dies from malaria every two minutes, on average, yet only one in five infected children receives the appropriate treatment.
Nearly a decade ago, Novartis helped develop the gold standard in pediatric antimalarial medicine, and we have donated more than 350 million doses since 2009.
But the persistence of deaths from malaria shows that treatment is not reaching every child in need.
Clearly, we need to expand access to medicine, not just through ad hoc measures, but by building the capacity of health-care systems.
That is why the next chapter of global health development must focus on improving the delivery of care.
Since 2000, the global health community has saved millions of lives by responding to specific epidemics like HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.
But these efforts must now be fully integrated into national health systems to ensure that all patients are consistently receiving high-quality care.
Progress will require eliminating shortages of doctors and nurses, adopting electronic recordkeeping, and strengthening the availability and quality of primary care.
These measures would help not just in the fight against infectious diseases, but also in the ongoing effort to treat chronic diseases, which are imposing an additional disease burden on many developing countries.
Needless to say, improving health-care systems will require more resources and firm leadership, particularly in the countries most affected by malaria.
And, as almost all of the study participants made clear, we need to move beyond traditional donor-funding mechanisms to tap into domestic resources.
Ghana is one of the countries that is leading the way on this front.
In response to dwindling donor funds, the Ghanaian government brought the country’s private-sector leaders together to launch the Ghana Malaria Foundation, which currently is working to fill urgent funding gaps, but will eventually help lead a sustainable, domestic effort to eliminate malaria from the country.
This is a challenging moment in the fight against malaria. But it’s also a moment of opportunity.
For its part, Novartis recently announced that it will invest more than $100 million in antimalarial R&D over the next five years, to help contain emerging resistant strains of the disease.
Our focus now is on completing clinical trials for two promising new antimalarial drug candidates.
While these therapies are being developed, we are also working on a strategy to ensure that patients in malaria-endemic countries can afford them, and to improve the effectiveness of our response by identifying areas where malaria takes the greatest toll.
The fight against malaria has been a multi-decade marathon.
Through the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the world has formally committed to ending the malaria epidemic by 2030.
That objective is within sight, but we cannot count on our current approach to carry us across the finish line.
Rather, we need to listen to those on the front lines and heed their calls for a renewed commitment to ending malaria.
By investing in next-generation tools and building sustainable health-care systems, we can consign this disease to the history books once and for all.

The Language of Conflict
NEW DELHI – I was having lunch in an Ithaca restaurant with my mother-in-law, who was visiting from India, when the Chinese waitress serving us asked her where she came from. “Kolhapur,” my mother-in-law replied, referring to the small town in Maharashtra where she was born.
Much to my surprise, the waitress looked overjoyed. “I lived there for several years,” she said.
They hit it off.
My mother-in-law said that the world’s best ice cream comes from there, and the waitress agreed that she had never had better since she left.
After a while, I realized what was happening: my mother-in-law was talking about Kolhapur, and the waitress about Kuala Lumpur.
But all their facts matched perfectly, so I decided not to spoil their joy.
Language is a strange thing.
It is an enabler of human progress and happiness (including through amusing misunderstandings like the one in Ithaca), but it can also be a source of conflict and an instrument of oppression.
The connection between language and conflict is not as far removed from the social sciences, including game theory, as many think.
By exploring this important link more closely, economists and other researchers could perform a great service by helping us understand the contemporary world.
After all, we live in the best and worst of times.
The world has never been as rich as it is today.
Yet it is coming apart at the seams, amid increasing political polarization, great-power rivalry, and xenophobia.
Today’s mix of rising prosperity and deepening divisions is reminiscent of the Industrial Revolution that began in the mid-eighteenth century and lasted nearly a hundred years.
Unsurprisingly, that era coincided with major theoretical breakthroughs in political economy, from Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations in 1776, to the contributions of Augustin Cournot and Léon Walras.
Theirs were not everyday research findings.
Like the later seminal work of John Hicks, Paul Samuelson, and Kenneth Arrow in the twentieth century, they produced deep insights that provided sudden, blinding clarity about how the economy works, and how politics interacts with markets and economic wellbeing.
Although we cannot predict the path of future political-economy research, past experience suggests it will be in multiple directions.
Language is likely to be one of them.
Some scholars have already provided critical insights into the political economy of language, such as Princeton University’s Stephen Morris on political correctness.
But there is much more to be done, particularly on the connection between language and conflict.
Signs of this link are evident in the United States, where, earlier this month, President Donald Trump made statements which seem patently racist.
He said that four nonwhite Democratic congresswomen should “go back” to the countries they came from – even though three were born in the US and the fourth is a naturalized citizen who arrived as a child refugee.
And yet Trump’s appeals to white identity appear to have cost him few supporters.
I do not believe all his supporters are racists.
The generous interpretation is that they use language differently from Trump’s critics.
Because what a speaker means and what a listener hears can be very different, language can be an instrument to foment trouble.
Much of the problem stems from the fact that the real world is extremely varied and granular, whereas language is coarse by comparison.
Some political leaders seek to exploit this to control and subjugate the population.
George Orwell’s 1984 describes a team of bureaucrats working on the eleventh edition of the Newspeak Dictionary to “cut language down to the bone.”
As Orwell puts it, one of them “bit hungrily into his bread,” and said, “It’s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.”
If, for example, people regard the words “socialism” and “communism” as synonymous, rather than describing different systems of political economy, then it can become impossible to talk about the former without stoking fears of the latter.
Similarly, a right-wing group in Israel can silence dissent by promoting the view that criticism of the group is equivalent to anti-Semitism (or self-hatred, in the case of Jewish critics).
This would prompt many people who would hate to be anti-Semitic to avoid criticizing the group.
In India, some groups label anyone espousing ideas to the left of the extreme right as an “urban Naxal,” referring to a violent revolutionary group with which few want to be associated.
In a similar vein, the Indian columnist Mrinal Pande has highlighted how the use of modern Hindi to promote a chauvinist culture and totalitarian ideas creates division, and also damages the reputation of the language itself.
Digital technology and the continued growth of social media are increasing the scope for conflict and political mischief by bringing together large numbers of people from different cultural and political backgrounds.
For many of them, the same word may have a different emotional or political valence, and the same sequence of words may be interpreted in different – even contradictory – ways.
As words acquire new meanings, many people stop using certain words in order not to be seen as sitting on the fence.
As the fence shifts, this becomes a dynamic process producing increasingly polarized societies.
Understanding these dynamics will require a combination of logic, equilibrium analysis, philosophy, and creativity.
The world is changing as rapidly as it did during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, if not more so.
It is time for economists to venture out in novel directions, as their illustrious predecessors did.

The Central-Bank Song Remains the Same
LONDON – The changing of the guard that is taking place at the systemically important central banks in 2018-2019 will mark the beginning of a new era of monetary policy.
Who is likely to lead this transition to a “new normal”?
More important, just how new will it really be?
In the decade since the global financial crisis, advanced-country central banks have adopted unprecedentedly active monetary policies.
The Bank of Japan’s Haruhiko Kuroda and the European Central Bank’s Mario Draghi maintain such policies to this day, in order to stimulate economic activity and counter deflationary pressures.
By contrast, the US Federal Reserve, beginning under former Chair Janet Yellen, and the Bank of England, under Mark Carney, have been laying the groundwork for policy “normalization.”
Another systemically important central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has focused not on monetary expansion, but on financial reform.
Former PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan built a strong reputation domestically and, perhaps more so, internationally during his record-setting 15-year tenure, owing to his gradual, steady, and effective approach.
Although the PBOC’s lack of official independence means that his authority to set interest rates was constrained by the advice of the 15-member Monetary Policy Committee, this did not affect Zhou’s ability to put in place the foundations of a financial sector befitting the world’s largest economy.
Yet, even as central banks face important transitions, the choices of their new leaders have reflected a desire for continuity.
Most obvious, Kuroda has been confirmed for another five-year term at the BOJ, and Zhou was replaced in March by his own deputy governor, Yi Gang.
Even Yellen’s successor, Jerome Powell, will probably amount to more of the same.
Of course, Powell was initially presented as a break from the past.
After all, if President Donald Trump had wanted to remain on the same path, he would have just selected Yellen for a second term (which would have been more in line with tradition).
But, in Trump’s view, the Democrat Yellen was a vestige of Barack Obama’s administration, and thus had to be replaced with a declared Republican like Powell.
But both Powell and Yellen are Fed veterans, and seem to be following the same normalization path.
In Europe, the changes brought by the new governors are likely to be more significant.
At the BoE, Carney – who announced in November 2016 his intention to cut short his term – will remain in the job until a few months after the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in March 2019, in order to minimize any market disruption.
But Carney’s replacement is likely to represent a significant departure.
Despite his impeccable track record as the governor of Canada’s central bank, Carney’s appointment was controversial: he has always been perceived as too close to the previous chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, and insufficiently sympathetic to Brexiteers.
Carney’s successor will thus have to be congenial, if not amenable, to Brexit’s champions.
In a sense, however, Carney’s replacement will amount to the restoration of the status quo.
After all, when Carney was “imported,” he was disrupting the tradition of in-house appointments – a tradition that will be revitalized if, as seems likely, one of the BoE’s current deputy governors is named as his replacement.
Perhaps the most profound shift will happen at the ECB, where four top posts will need to be filled by the end of next year.
The recent nomination of former Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos to serve as ECB vice president offers some clues regarding what to expect.
In particular, the choice of a Spanish vice president (which in Guindos’s case represents a break with the tradition – intended to protect central-bank independence – of not appointing politicians) suggests that the next president will come from the northern eurozone.
Of the eurozone’s three largest economies, only Germany has never held the presidency.
If the presidency goes to a German, that German will most likely be Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann.
A monetary hawk, Weidmann will struggle to win southern countries’ support.
Moreover, his nomination will trigger the resignation of another German, Sabine Lautenschläger, the only woman on the ECB’s executive board.
The prospect of an exclusively male board – not to mention the fact that no woman was even short-listed for the presidency – will not go down well with the European Parliament.
The European Parliament’s preference for greater gender parity is surely welcome, though it is probably based more on a desire to avoid criticism than a genuine commitment to diversity.
And, in fact, with their selections for the top jobs, all central banks are failing in this respect, even though diversity is now viewed, in many institutional contexts, as an indicator of good performance.
In short, central-bank leadership remains an “old boys’ club.”
As we enter a new era for monetary policy, we should be seeking to overhaul central-bank leadership in a more fundamental way.
The lack of diversity among candidates for the top jobs suggests that the selection process is far too narrow and inward-looking.
Central banks ought to be cultivating younger people, women, and minorities, in order to broaden the range of approaches, skills, perspectives, and expertise that effective monetary policymaking will require in the future.
Real change eventually will come.
But for now, in terms of both policy and personnel, it’s mostly old wine in familiar bottles.

Economic Policy’s Narrative Imperative
WASHINGTON, DC – The best advice I received when taking up policymaking responsibilities in Turkey more than a decade ago was to take “a lot of time and care to develop and communicate the ‘narrative’ to support the policy program that you want to succeed.” The more that economic policy is subject to public debate – that is, the more democracy there is – the more important such policy narratives are.
The crisis faced by the European Union and the eurozone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it.
A successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic.
It must capture the imagination, address the public’s anxieties, and generate realistic hope.
Voters often sense cheap populism.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi provided such a narrative to the financial markets last July.
He said that the ECB would do everything necessary to prevent the disintegration of the euro, adding simply: “Believe me, it will be enough.”
With that sentence, Draghi eliminated the perceived re-denomination tail risk that was highest in the case of Greece, but that was driving up borrowing costs in Spain, Italy, and Portugal as well.
It was not a populist message, because the ECB does indeed have the firepower to buy enough sovereign bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates, at least for many months.
Central bankers, more generally, are typically able to provide short- or medium-term narratives to financial markets.
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke provided his own by pledging that US short-term interest rates would remain very low, and the Bank of Japan’s new chairman, Haruhiko Kuroda, has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2%.
While central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets, it is political leaders who must provide the overall socioeconomic messages that encourage long-term real investment, electoral support for reform, and hope for the future.
Central bank alchemy, to borrow a term from the US journalist Neil Irwin’s new book, has its limits.
Europe, in particular, needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery.
France is coming closer to the danger zone, and even Germany’s annual GDP growth is falling well below 1% per year.
In the meantime, the easing of sovereign interest-rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern Europe, where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights – close to 60% in Greece and Spain, and almost 40% in Italy.
The narrative should address three essential questions.
How can the European model of strong social solidarity and security be reformed, but endure?
How can economic growth be revived and sustained throughout the EU?
And how can Europe’s institutions function with enhanced legitimacy to accommodate countries that share the euro and others that retain their national currencies?
For starters, a revolution is required in the organization of work, learning, and leisure.
Social solidarity, essential to European identity, can and must include longer work lives, but also more work-sharing, adult learning, and shorter average work weeks (particularly close to retirement).
Such flexibility requires the consent of all: employees must adjust to changing requirements; employers must re-organize their enterprises to allow more work-sharing, work from home, and learning intervals; and governments must overhaul taxes, income support, and regulation to promote a “flex-solidarity revolution” that encourages personal choice and responsibility, while remaining committed to social cohesion.
This can lead to a better future for all, with citizens gaining better access to adult education, having more free time to pursue personal interests, and remaining productive and occupationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives.
Europe does not need Asia’s rates of economic growth.
It can secure decent jobs and prosperity, with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2%.
To achieve that, German voters should be told not that their country’s resources will forever flow to Spain, but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without risking inflation or a current-account deficit, because Germany has the world’s largest external surplus.
Service-sector industries throughout the EU must be opened up.
The countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan-European skill-upgrading program.
The number of pan-European scholarships should be doubled.
School programs everywhere should aim to educate trilingual citizens.
Moreover, a full European banking union with shared resources for resolution should be created without further delay.
The European Investment Bank, which received a significant capital increase in 2012, should add a large investment-support program for medium-size enterprises to its current operations, with a subsidy financed from the European budget to encourage first-time job takers for a limited period.
Jobs and training for young people must be the centerpiece for the new growth pact, and projects must move ahead in “crisis mode,” rather than according to business as usual.
Finally, while monetary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereignty, there should also be a “greater Europe” that includes the United Kingdom and others.
This implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries: the “euro-ins” and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values.
These interconnected visions can and must be realized if Europe is to thrive again.
Together, they form a compelling narrative that European leaders must begin to articulate.

Reforming Germany's Army
MUNICH: What are the military threats European countries now face?
What forces are required to meet them?
How much are governments willing to pay?
The debate over these issues has now reached West Europe's biggest army, Germany's Bundeswehr.
Its outcome concerns not only Germans but their partners in Nato and the EU as well.
It is a belated debate here.
The Cold War ended a decade ago, and most of Germany's allies conducted their debate years ago.
If Germany has lagged, it is for two reasons: Germany's security environment has undergone the most dramatic change, and Germans remain deeply attached to military conscription.
Revolutions happen quickly but it takes time to adjust to the changes they bring.
For half-a-century, Germany was the point where the Cold War was most likely to turn hot.
Then, beginning in the spring of 1990, Germany united, the Warsaw Pact and USSR disintegrated, and countries to Germany's east, which had been the staging post for Soviet tank armies, suddenly became friends, then partners.
In 1994 the last Russian soldier left German soil.
That would have been the moment to take stock of Germany's new strategic situation.
But Helmut Kohl's government feared that any examination would unravel the central feature of the army created in the mid-1950s and a major condition for its wide acceptance in the country: military conscription.
The military embraces conscription because it assures the armed forces of high-quality recruits and a close link to civil society; politicians like it because it helps make the armed forces transparent; agencies of the welfare state appreciate it because, without conscription, there would be no conscientious objectors to be usefully (and cheaply) employed in all sorts of social tasks.
So the armed forces found themselves in a double bind: the Cold War's end prompted calls for a peace dividend and for unification to be funded.
Germany's defense budget slid to lower levels even faster than did those of her allies.
But to maintain conscription implied a large and costly military structure which bloated personal expenditure at the price of squeezing the budget share of military investment.
The result is an army neither manned nor equipped for dealing with likely security threats, nor for cooperating with the armed forces of Germany's allies.
So reform became inevitable.
Because the conservatives of Helmut Kohl did not address it, Gerhard Schroeder's left coalition had to.
A year ago, it set up an independent "Commission on Common Security and the Future of the Armed Forces" under the chairmanship of Richard von Weizsaecker, the respected former President of the Republic.
Earlier this week, the Commission's report was published.
A debate long in coming is finally beginning.
The 179 page document does not mince words.
The Bundeswehr has no future in its current structure.
Germany is no longer threatened by invading armies; she is surrounded by allies in Nato and partners in the EU.
This strategic condition is here to stay.
Instead of the capability for repulsing a massive attack on its borders, the armed forces need to be able to intervene in and manage crises B whether within or beyond Nato B in joint operations with their closest allies.
Hence what counts is the number and equipment of forces deployable for crisis operations.
At the moment, barely sixty thousand soldiers qualify; the Weizsaecker Commission calls for an increase to 140,000 of different stages of readiness, sufficient to intervene in two simultaneous crises.
At the same time, it proposes a drastic reduction in the overall size of the Bundeswehr: from the current 320,000 to no more than 240,000 men and women (yes, women: they will be eligible for practically all military functions).
The number of conscripts, with a military service of 10 months, should be 30,000 a year, down from the present 130,000.
In other words: the number of soldiers needed for the new tasks goes up, while the total of the armed forces goes down.
The resulting savings are proposed to modernize military hardware and equip the forces for future tasks.
Just as soldiers and their means should be geared to these, so the chain of command needs to be streamlined to assure rapid deployment of combined forces, in close coordination with allies, and with political oversight guaranteed.
It will take up to six years, the Commission estimates, to manage the transition from the present to the future Bundeswehr, and Weizs„cker suggests a program budget to make sure the reform stays on course.
But if it does, Germany will be fully capable of honoring commitments she has undertaken in Nato and the EU.
Indeed, the reform will give a boost to much closer European defence cooperation by increasing interoperability with major European allies and encouraging joint procurement, joint production and joint management of military investment.
Now politicians are taking over.
In the ensuing public debate, two items have already emerged as central: money and conscription B one politically demanding, the other politically convenient.
These reforms will not come cheap.
Although the new Bundeswehr will be more cost-efficient, it will need money to manage the changeover, more than currently planned by a government set on a laudable course of fiscal consolidation.
Will Chancellor Schroeder be willing to commit himself to reforms which will bring fruit only after the next elections?
Conscription is another matter.
While one third of the Commission members favored a volunteer army, the majority supported conscription, albeit with a smaller number of call-ups than today.
Their reasoning: Since the future is uncertain, it makes sense to retain the flexibility conscription permits, to respond both to unforeseen changes in the security environment and to shortfalls in the recruitment of volunteers; here the difficulties that allied armies are encountering which have jettisoned conscription have been a warning.
But the number of young men to be called up depends on the requirements of the forces; hence the Commission insists on no less than ten months' service.
This explains the much reduced figure of only 30.000 a year.
It is this part of the proposal which is encountering most criticism.
Most political parties reject it, preferring instead to draft a much higher number.
The Commission's selective draft, they argue is unconstitutional because it allows the large majority of eligible young men to escape conscription.
This may not be the last word in the debate.
For to argue that the draft is only just if everyone is called up regardless of military requirements is unconvincing, provided those that are drafted are compensated for their service.
Moreover, to draft more than one needs is a costly luxury.
That recognition is gradually sinking in, at least in the government.
Defense Minister Scharping who is currently preparing his own proposals for the future Bundeswehr, also envisages a major reduction in the number of conscripts though not as drastic as the Commission wants.
Less money and more conscripts will slow down, and possibly derail, the Weizsaecker reforms.
But then commissions propose, politicians dispose.
They are under greater constraints than independent advisers, they get the credit for success but also bear the risk of failure.
It would be naive, therefore, to demand that they should not deviate from the script that Weizsaecker wrote.
It would be wrong, as some are doing, to dismiss the Report as an inconsequential wishlist.
In one year of hard work, Weizsaecker's group has done what no other body in government or parliament can do: define the benchmark for needed reforms.
Politicians will deviate, but they will have to account for it if and when they do.
That is why it is safe to say: reform of the Bundeswehr is finally under way.

Fascism with a Feminist Face
NEW YORK – Western feminism has made some memorable theoretical mistakes; a major one is the frequent assumption that, if women held the decision-making power in society, they would be “kinder and gentler” (a phrase devised for George H.W. Bush in 1988 to appeal to the female vote).
Indeed, so-called “second-wave” feminist theory abounds in assertions that war, racism, love of hierarchy, and general repressiveness belong to “patriarchy”; women’s leadership, by contrast, would naturally create a more inclusive, collaborative world.
The problem is that it has never worked out that way, as the rise of women to leadership positions in Western Europe’s far-right parties should remind us.
Leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front, Pia Kjaersgaard of Denmark’s People’s Party, and Siv Jensen of Norway’s Progress Party reflect the enduring appeal of neofascist movements to many modern women in egalitarian, inclusive liberal democracies.
The past is prologue: Wendy Lower’s recent book Hitler’s Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields adds more data to the long record of women embracing violent right-wing movements.
And the rise of far-right movements in Europe – often with women in charge – confronts us with the fact that the heirs to the fascism of the 1930’s have their own gender-based appeal.
One obvious reason for the success of women like Le Pen, Kjaersgaard, and Jensen is their value for packaging and marketing their parties.
Just as Bush sought to revamp the Republican Party’s “brand’ of cold-hearted elitism and hostility to women, so Europe’s far-right parties today must appeal to citizens by not seeming dangerously extreme and marginal.
How dangerous can the movement be, after all, if women are speaking for it?
Such parties come to be seen as more mainstream, and their appeal to traditionally harder-to-win women supporters receives a boost.
As Lower shows, the Nazis reached out with special programs – from organizing homemakers to colonizing the conquered Eastern territories – that gave working-class women things they craved: a sense of belonging to something larger than themselves (fascism’s eternal draw), backed by a complex official iconography in which the traditionally devalued roles of wife and mother held a crucial place in the national drama.
Young unmarried women who were sent to administer the neocolonial efforts in conquered Poland and other territories gained adventure, advanced professional training, and opportunity.
And, for all of these women, as for any subordinate group anywhere, fascism appealed to what social scientists call “last-place aversion”: the desire to outrank other groups.
Add, finally, the gendered appeal of the strong authority figure and rigid hierarchy, which attracts some women as much as some men, if in different psychodynamic ways. As Sylvia Plath, the daughter of a German father, put it in her poem “Daddy”: “Every woman adores a Fascist/The boot in the face, the brute/Brute heart of a brute like you.”
Certainly, many of the same themes in far-right ideology attract the support of some women in Europe today.
And we can add the fact that right-wing movements benefit from the limitations of a postfeminist, post-sexual-revolution society, and the spiritual and emotional void produced by secular materialism.
Many lower-income women in Western Europe today – often single parents working pink-collar ghetto jobs that leave them exhausted and without realistic hope of advancement – can reasonably enough feel a sense of nostalgia for past values and certainties.
For them, the idealized vision of an earlier age, one in which social roles were intact and women’s traditional contribution supposedly valued, can be highly compelling.
And, of course, parties that promote such a vision promise women – including those habituated to second-class status at work and the bulk of the labor at home – that they are not just faceless atoms in the postmodern mass.
Rather, you, the lowly clerical worker, are a “true” Danish, Norwegian, or French woman.
You are an heiress to a noble heritage, and thus not only better than the mass of immigrants, but also part of something larger and more compelling than is implied by the cog status that a multiracial, secular society offers you.
The attraction of right-wing parties to women should be examined, not merely condemned.
If a society does not offer individuals a community life that takes them beyond themselves, values only production and the bottom line, and opens itself to immigrants without asserting and cherishing what is special and valuable about Danish, Norwegian, or French culture, it is asking for trouble.
For example, upholding the heritage of the Enlightenment and progressive social ideals does not require racism or pejorative treatment of other cultures; but politically correct curricula no longer even make the attempt to do so.
Until we stop regarding cultural pluralism as being incompatible with the defense of legitimate universal values, fascist movements will attract those who need the false hope and sense of self-worth that such movements offer, regardless of gender.

Reforming France
PARIS – Before this year has ended, the French parliament will have enacted a comprehensive pension overhaul, which is essential not only to putting France’s public finances on a sound and sustainable footing, but also to shoring up confidence in the eurozone in 2014 and beyond.
Moreover, how the reform was carried out is as important as the measure itself.
France has more favorable demographics than most other European countries.
Nonetheless, further effort was needed to strengthen the pay-as-you-go pension system by the equivalent of one percentage point of GDP.
The contribution period will therefore be increased gradually, reaching 43 years in 2035.
This effort has gained broad public acceptance because it was fair: both retirees and working people will contribute, as will companies and households.
Financing and social needs alike have been taken into account, while the drawbacks of the current system will be addressed, benefiting women, people who have experienced non-continuous careers, those with particularly strenuous occupations, and low-income retirees.
Most important, for the first time, pension reform has been carried out in France in continuous consultation with employers’ associations and trade unions.
Many people were expecting a showdown.
Instead, an atmosphere of constructive negotiation prevailed.
In other words, the key to success has been justice, balance, and social dialogue.
In September, a leading European Union official said of a proposed measure, “This is a French-style reform!” Regardless of whether it was intended as a criticism, I considered it a compliment.
Some in Europe think that the only good reform is one that hurts.
This is not my vision: yes, modernization is needed in the context of a changing world, but it does not have to be divisive.
The challenge for Europe is to advance without falling apart.
That means providing Europe’s citizens with a renewed sense of hope and opportunity.
France has been actively helping to stabilize the eurozone by encouraging structural progress, such as the establishment of a European banking union.
We also need to strengthen social cohesion on the continent.
That is the whole purpose of solidarity-based integration, as called for by President François Hollande.
The European Council’s revision this month of the Posting of Workers Directive, which applies to employees who are sent temporarily to work in another EU member state, is a good start.
But we have to go further.
The establishment of an EU-wide minimum wage would send a strong signal to citizens that Europe is a social reality.
In France, after ten years of decline in export markets, my government has embarked on a bold strategy to restore our country’s competitiveness.
This year, we implemented a reduction of social-welfare taxes that will amount to around one percentage point of GDP when phased in fully by 2016.
France has also undertaken ambitious reforms to reduce job-market dualism and give greater flexibility to employers as well as greater security to employees.
Moreover, the upcoming pension reform caps 18 months of significant steps toward fiscal consolidation that have improved the effectiveness of public spending while financing our priorities: education, the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy, employment, health care, and security.
Our efforts have been unprecedented, resulting in deficit reduction amounting to 1.5% of GDP in 2012, 1.7% in 2013, and an estimated 0.9% in 2014.
By 2015, deficit reduction will rely entirely on spending cuts.
While we have responded to emergencies in this period, we have not sacrificed our ability to push through more reforms in the future.
Indeed, the restoration of social dialogue as a tool with which to forge long-lasting consensus represents a deep cultural shift that augurs well for such efforts.
Many of these efforts are already underway: comprehensive reform of vocational training, a framework for adopting new sources of energy, and, last but not least, a complete overhaul of our tax system in favor of job creation and growth.
Ultimately, we will be judged on the basis of our reforms’ economic efficiency and social fairness.
Our task is to demonstrate our ability to reform government, offer high-quality public services – for example, education and health care – for all at a reasonable cost, and control public spending in order to restore our ability to reduce taxes without impeding debt reduction.
My ambition is the creation of a “new French model” that places sustainable solidarity at its center, with all citizens aware of what they owe everyone else.
Such a model – in which government empowers private initiatives and is dedicated to smoothing the major economic and environmental transitions of our time – offers opportunity for all, while relying on the power of collective action.
It is thanks to these values, to the acute consciousness of what individual and collective strengths can achieve in tandem, that France has always found the necessary resources to rebuild and modernize.
By being true to ourselves, and open to the world, we will make our voice heard in Europe and beyond.

How Companies Should Leverage Digitization
NEW YORK – It is no secret that rapid digitization is upending firms’ operations, systems, and entire business models.
Whether companies can both manage the risks and also reap the massive rewards that digital technologies can deliver depends significantly on the actions they take in five key areas.
First, digitization should enable managers to allocate the company’s capital and labor better – in real time.
Efficient companies regularly review and upgrade their operations in at least three ways: streamlining existing processes, adopting best practices from outside their organizations, and identifying the most productive use of their assets.
Digital technology can enhance all of these activities.
Movie-theater companies, for example, already deploy human capital based on real-time demand trends: in the United States, information about ticket sales and social-media reviews following releases on the East Coast will shape staffing decisions on the West Coast.
Similar approaches can be implemented (or enhanced) in a wide range of sectors, boosting efficiency and productivity.
The benefits will grow progressively, as companies adjust their hiring practices to target candidates with the relevant expertise.
But, just as fast-growing stores of data can aid management teams, they also risk complicating the picture.
Fortunately, digitization can help managers to organize and collate data to enhance decision-making.
This is the second key area.
Traditionally, management teams worked with far less information.
Businesses tended to operate within one or few jurisdictions.
And company decision-makers would hear the perspectives of a sub-set of stakeholders, such as shareowners (at annual general meetings or in smaller-group conversations) and employees (through internal surveys).
Today, businesses increasingly operate across multiple jurisdictions, and hear from a much broader set of stakeholders – including customers and community members – especially through social media.
Public pressure is already forcing corporations to divulge more details about their products’ provenance, including working conditions, average wages, and environmental metrics, such as the amount of water used and carbon dioxide emitted.
With employees able to air their grievances on digital platforms outside the company’s purview – such as Glassdoor, Blind, and TheLayoff.com – there is nowhere for firms to hide.
In such an environment, managers must be able to organize and interpret data for themselves, identify broad economic, geopolitical, and social trends, and use the insights they glean to adapt their strategies quickly.
To this end, they should foster productive engagement with all stakeholders and leverage digital technologies – and the data they provide – to root out inefficiencies, eliminate redundancies, and simplify burdensome processes.
The third way organizations must apply digitization is to enhance organizational flexibility in responding to external threats and opportunities.
For example, trends underpinning de-globalization – including protectionist policies, cross-border capital controls, and tighter immigration rules – may affect where and how companies sell their products, how they fund themselves and deploy investment capital, which talent pools they can tap, and how reliable their supply chains are.
In particular, escalating tensions between China and the West have raised the specter of balkanized trade, technology, and currency regimes.
We may even see the emergence of a “splinternet,” characterized by two competing digital environments, led by the US and China, with different IP protocols.
This would pose a serious challenge for many companies, which are set up to operate in a single globalized system, with centralized financing, procurement, and hiring systems.
Amid rapid social, economic, and cultural change, organizations need to build flexibility into their business models and operations.
Digital technologies can provide that flexibility in a cost-effective way, reducing friction costs and mitigating downside operational risks, while enabling firms to trade, raise and deploy capital, and hire in a balkanized or bifurcated system.
Digitization can also enable firms to tailor their offerings – and prices – to individual consumers.
This is the fourth priority area.
Life insurers have long priced the policies they offer on the basis of individual factors, such as health status, lifestyle, and actuarial tables.
As gathering and analyzing high-quality data about consumers becomes easier, a wider range of companies will be able to take a similarly personalized approach to pricing.
Some industries already have a relatively tailored approach.
Consider financial products, such as mortgages and car loans. Today, a group of people with broadly the same set of attributes would be charged the same interest rate.
With greater digitization, individual customers can be charged an interest rate that is better aligned with their specific risk profile, including a range of metrics from assets to life expectancy.
If corporations design and execute effective digitization strategies in these four areas, they will both boost revenues (by getting more goods and services into the hands of customers faster) and reduce costs (by streamlining hiring, manufacturing, production, and logistics processes).
Rethinking how to distribute the increase in profits resulting from digitization is the fifth priority area.
Companies typically divide profits among debt reduction, reinvestment, and payouts to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, or store them for long-term strategic purposes.
But as shareholder capitalism gives way to stakeholder capitalism, a broader range of interest groups – such as employees and local communities – will expect benefits.
Companies’ growing roles in areas like education, health care, and infrastructure – as well as the impending rise in structural unemployment owing to automation and digitization – will reinforce this expectation.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the fragility of many business models, it has also intensified the race to adopt cutting-edge technologies.
But adoption is only the first step.
How these technologies are applied across the five priority areas described here will determine who reaches the finish line – and when.

The Dollar’s Last Days?
CAMBRIDGE – Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, recently suggested that replacing the dollar with the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights as the dominant reserve currency would bring greater stability to the global financial system.
The idea of reforming the system by introducing a supranational reserve currency is also, it appears, supported by Russia and other emerging markets.
And a United Nations advisory committee chaired by the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has argued for a new global reserve currency, possibly one based on the SDR.
Transforming the dollar standard into an SDR-based system would be a major break with a policy that has lasted more than 60 years.
The SDR was introduced 40 years ago to supplement what was then seen as an inadequate level of global reserves, and was subsequently enshrined in the IMF’s amended Articles of Agreement as the future principal reserve asset.
But the world soon became awash in dollars.
So, instead of becoming the principal reserve asset of the global system, the proportion of SDRs in global reserves shrank to a tiny fraction, rendering the SDR the monetary equivalent of Esperanto.
Although the euro, created in 1999, turned out to be a more serious competitor to the dollar, its share in total international reserves has probably remained below 30%, compared to 65% for the dollar (these shares are in part estimates, as China, the world’s largest holder of reserves, does not report the currency composition of its holdings).
There are two ways in which the dollar’s role in the international monetary system can be reduced.
One possibility is a gradual, market-determined erosion of the dollar as a reserve currency in favor of the euro.
But, while the euro’s international role – especially its use in financial markets – has increased since its inception, it is hard to envisage it overtaking the dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the foreseeable future.
Such an outcome is probably only possible if two conditions are met: first, the United Kingdom joins the euro area, and, second, the United States makes serious, confidence-sapping mistakes.
The latter condition may already have been partially met, but US policies to stabilize its financial system should help avoid a major dollar slide.
Moreover, the European Central Bank has repeatedly stated that it neither encourages nor discourages the euro’s international role.
With the dollar’s hegemony unlikely to be seriously undermined by market forces, at least in the short and medium-term, the only way to bring about a major reduction in its role as a reserve currency is by international agreement.
The Chinese proposal falls into this category.
One way to make the SDR the major reserve currency relatively soon would be to create and allocate a massive amount of new SDRs to the IMF’s members.
While the G-20 leaders have decided to support an SDR allocation of $250 billion, this will increase the share of SDRs in total international reserves to no more than 4%.
In order to make the SDR the principal reserve asset via the allocation route, close to $3 trillion in SDRs would need to be created, an unrealistic proposition.
But there is a more realistic way for the SDR’s importance to grow.
Back in 1980, the IMF came close to adopting a so-called SDR Substitution Account.
The idea was to permit countries whose official dollar holdings were larger than they were comfortable with to convert dollars into SDRs.
Conversion would occur outside the market, and thus would not put downward pressure on the dollar.
Member countries would receive an asset that was more stable than the dollar, as it was based on a basket of currencies, thereby providing better protection against losses.
The plan fell apart when some major IMF shareholders could not accept the burden-sharing arrangements that would be necessary in case of losses due to exchange-rate movements.
The US also lost interest in the scheme as the dollar strengthened.
What are the chances of adopting a scheme of this kind today?
Is the US prepared to go along with a reform of the international monetary system that reduces the dollar’s role?
Until recently, I would have considered this unlikely.
But the changed international climate, and the possibility of a bout of severe dollar weakness, could convince the US to go along with a conversion scheme that would alleviate excessive pressure on the dollar.
And, apart from possible political considerations, large holders of dollars would find a substitution account attractive as a form of protection against strong fluctuations in the dollar’s value.
What about possible losses suffered by the Substitution Account? This can be dealt with by setting aside part of the IMF’s large gold stock.
Even if an SDR Substitution Account is established, it is unlikely that the dollar’s share in international reserves would fall to an insignificant level.
The dollar will remain important for many countries as a vehicle for intervention in foreign-exchange markets, as well as for invoicing and for denominating internationally traded securities.
But one can envisage a system in which international reserves are held each in roughly equal shares of dollars, euros (assuming a further gradual increase in its share), and SDRs.
While there are currently other priorities, it would be useful for the IMF to study anew an SDR substitution account and similar schemes.
If it does not, the debate will take place elsewhere.

Trump’s Failed Iran Policy
CANBERRA – In response to US President Donald Trump’s policy of maximum pressure, Iran has just seized a second foreign oil tanker.
Trump’s approach to bringing Iran’s Islamic regime to heel clearly is not working.
If anything, it has created another Middle East flashpoint, undermined transatlantic relations, benefited Russia and China, and struck a serious blow to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Where to from here?
Trump’s biggest problem is that the other signatories to the 2015 nuclear agreement – officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – from which he has withdrawn the United States, have remained committed to the deal.
Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China have also opposed Trump’s imposition of crippling economic sanctions on Iran.
They are committed to preserving the agreement and to doing everything possible to persuade Iran’s leaders to continue to adhere to it.
The European signatories have established a special mechanism to facilitate trade and business with Iran at the risk of US retaliation, while Russia and China have expanded their economic and strategic ties with the Islamic Republic, marking the first time in the history of the Western alliance that America’s European allies have joined forces with its rivals.
These powers’ support for Iran is not adequate to compensate for American secondary sanctions, which punish all governments and companies that do business there.
But it can soften the sanctions’ effects and strengthen the Iranian regime’s resilience.
Iran has already shown its capacity to resist by downing an US spy drone, allegedly targeting six oil tankers, and seizing two more in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz.
It has thus signaled its ability to choke the Strait, through which one-fifth of the world’s oil passes, despite the US show of force in the Gulf to ensure maritime safety.
Trump’s usual confusing policy pronouncements have not helped him either.
He has moved from one end of the spectrum, defined by his hawkish Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to act militarily against Iran, to the other end, where his own “no war” impulses have prevailed.
He seeks to use America’s economic power, combined with threats, rather than military might, to achieve his objectives.
But when it comes to Iran, he has picked the wrong target.
He and his advisers have shown a very poor understanding of the nature of the Iranian regime and have underestimated its reactive capability in a highly complex region.
Trump’s team has missed the point that the regime is well entrenched and benefits from a robust regional security structure, stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon and Yemen.
It is ideological in character, but pragmatic when it comes to its survival.
The fortunes of the ruling clerics and their supporters are intertwined with the regime’s survival.
The highest echelons of the regime still comprise those who are very distrustful of the US, owing to America’s long years of support for the monarchy of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 revolution that toppled the Shah, sought to build an Islamic polity with the capacity to withstand its internal and external adversaries.
Khomeini died in mid-1989, but his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has essentially followed in his footsteps, acting both ideologically and pragmatically in order to ensure the continuity of the Islamic regime.
While resentful of the US and its allies, he has been flexible enough, for example, to bless the JCPOA, forge close relations with Russia and China, and maintain reasonable ties with European powers to cope with American pressure.
Meanwhile, the Islamic regime has worked intensively to build its soft and hard power, involving a network of sectarian and strategic partners across the region.
It has nurtured an asymmetrical warfare strategy in order not only to survive a foreign attack, but to turn it into a devastating regional confrontation.
It has lived with US sanctions for most of its 40 years and mastered a variety of methods to circumvent American pressure.
This does not mean that the regime is unwilling to renegotiate the JCPOA.
It has already signaled a willingness to do so, but only if this does not threaten its domestic and regional security and only if given sufficient economic and strategic incentives to do so.
The regime remains factionalized between hardliners and moderates, with the former in control of more levers of power than the latter.
But it would be erroneous to assume that in the face of a serious external threat all the factions would not unite, and be supported by a majority of the public, who have historically been known for their fierce nationalist sentiment.
The US policy of confronting and containing the regime has not borne fruit.
President Barack Obama’s policy of engagement proved to be more productive, as the conclusion of the JCPOA showed.
Trump, however, has painted himself into a corner, and now faces the prospect of an unwinnable military confrontation with far-reaching regional and wider implications, including economically devastating effects on oil supplies and prices.

Whose War on Terror?
“We are all Americans,” wrote Le Monde on September 12, 2001.
And so it was with most people in the Muslim world, who were as appalled as anyone else at the carnage of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York.
Indeed, when America responded to the attacks, almost no one mourned the fall of the Taliban, who were universally condemned for their fanaticism.
This unanimity of opinion no longer exists.
In the five years since the attacks, two audiences for the so-called “war on terror” have emerged.
Indeed, as the “war” progressed, the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diametrically opposed to that of the United States and the West.
To the US administration, every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self-contained: Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The Bush administration, having proclaimed a war on terror, invaded and occupied countries, and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region.
Glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite channels, the various battles of the “war on terror” came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against Islam.
Worse yet, America waved the banner of democracy as it prosecuted its wars.
But hopes for democracy, be it secular or Islamist, for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad, Beirut, and Kandahar.
Many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the West, and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence.
They know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations.
Only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies.
But the price of escape is a kind of deformation.
Embittered, fanatical, vengeful: those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking retaliation, not just against the regimes that deformed them, but against the West, which propped up the region’s authoritarians in the interest of “stability.”
Many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palestine, unsolved for three generations, goes beyond the suffering of the Palestinian people.
They know that the region’s dictators have used Palestine to justify their misrule and to avoid political and economic liberalization.
So when America called for democracy, the hearts of many in the region soared with the hope that reform would come at last.
But America, as so many times before, let them down.
As people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies, the US continued to endorse the regimes that were repressing them.
America simply could not adhere to its own democracy-promotion script.
After the ouster of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the US turned its sights on the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.
Instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi/Wahhabi regime – the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks – the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime.
Many Muslims acquiesced in this deviation, viewing the invasion of Iraq as part of the passing of dictatorship and the coming of democracy.
But the bloodstained shambles of the US occupation led America to abandon the quest for democracy.
The deeper America sank into the Iraqi quagmire, the more the US began to turn a blind eye to the region’s surviving dictators, particularly those in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and Pakistan.
Indeed, the last thing the region’s dictators wanted to see was a democratic Iraq.
Almost from the moment of Saddam’s fall, Saudi/Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded.
Worse yet, the Muslims who supported the project to democratize Iraq widely suspect that the Sunni resistance that incited the Iraqi civil war has been financed by Saudi oil money.
(Terrorism also kept Iraqi oil from becoming a serious challenger to Saudi Arabia.)
So the effort to democratize Iraq – indeed, the entire American project to democratize the region – has fallen under deep suspicion by even the most moderate of Muslims.
America, they believe, only wants a democracy that suits its interests.
If Palestinians freely vote for Hamas, their choice is actively opposed.
Lebanon’s “Cedar Revolution,” which galvanized the West in the same way as Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, has been systematically undermined.
With democracy in most of the region still a long way off – indeed, perhaps a more distant prospect now than five years ago – US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeats her mantra that the dead civilians of Beirut, Sidon, Tyre, and Gaza represent the “birth pangs” of a new Middle East.
But until the West stops regarding dead babies as political props, we cannot understand how the Muslim world perceives all that has happened since September 11, 2001.
Only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has fractured so violently.

The Globalization of Old Age
Anti-globalization campaigners gripe that the rich are getting richer.
That's true in many ways. But rich countries are also getting older.
This "graying" of the world's richest nations will profoundly affect not only these societies, but poorer countries as well.
According to the UN, the world's population now stands at 6.3 billion and will reach 9.3 billion by mid-century.
People aged 60 or more are projected to increase from 629 million now to nearly 2 billion by 2050.
Furthermore, the elderly population itself is aging.
The 80+ age group makes up the fastest-growing segment of the population; its share of the over-60 population will increase from 12% to 19% by 2050.
This "graying of the world" is a natural result of falling fertility rates and rising life expectancy.
While the decline in fertility is global, its speed varies across countries.
Rich countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia have a sharply higher share of the elderly than developing countries.
Fertility reductions in the richer parts of the world have already brought population growth rates close to zero.
Furthermore, due to improved access to quality health care and better living conditions, life spans in rich countries are now much longer than in the developing world.
People aged 60 or more represent almost 20% of the population in rich countries today, whereas in the world as a whole this ratio is not expected to be reached before 2050.
By that point, this age group in industrial countries will claim one-third of the total population.
It will take another century for the rest of the world to catch up.
One result of all this is that the relative number of working-age individuals between 15-64 who pay the taxes to support pensioners is declining much faster in the industrial world than in developing countries, where populations remain young and grow rapidly.
Rich economies are already challenged by this decline, and so are scrambling to meet the insatiable demands of public pension and health care systems, which causes their fiscal balances to deteriorate.
The effects of population aging will become even more obvious and widespread in the decades ahead, as domestic labor supply in rich countries shrinks even further.
Moreover, because the elderly tend to spend more and save less, rich countries will also face changes in the ratio of savings to consumption in their national income, as well as in the composition of what is purchased.
These demographically induced developments will not only affect investment and growth patterns of industrial economies, but the allocation of resources as well.
In a globalized world, what happens in rich countries has an impact on developing economies.
Yet, there is little discussion of the opportunities and challenges this presents.
Nowadays, most talk focuses on migration as a means of letting overpopulated developing countries fill the labor shortages of developed countries with graying populations.
Japan's population, for example, is projected to decline by 17.9 million by 2050, while the share of its 60+ population will climb to 42%, and the share of its 80+ population will exceed 10%.
The number of working-age Japanese will thus fall sharply, bringing the ratio of workers to retirees to about one.
Estimates suggest that Japan would need 10 million immigrants per year until 2050 just to maintain the ratio of workers to pensioners that it had in 1995!
Will developed countries really allow for migration on such a scale?
Or will they instead increase their imports of manufactured products and food, thus creating jobs in developing countries that might help absorb their surplus labor?
Even if rich countries choose increased imports, the growing volume of trade will merely expand an existing channel for routing the effects of an aging population onto developing countries.
Trade serves as such a channel because nations with aging populations are economically powerful and so are capable of setting the terms on which they trade with poorer countries.
Developing countries that trade intensively with advanced economies must adopt their relative prices and allocate their resources accordingly.
But these relative prices will increasingly reflect the changed demands of the aging citizenry of industrial nations.
International capital flows will also magnify such demographic spillover effects, as capital is traded at the interest rates determined in large industrial economies.
These rates will increasingly be influenced by the changing age composition within advanced countries.
Because the old save less, lower aggregate savings in rich countries will crimp the relative abundance of capital available to poorer economies.
The powerful combination of globalization and aging will make developing economies ever more susceptible to changes in the terms of trade, interest rates, and exchange rates in rich countries.
All developing countries should monitor these demographic developments closely, even if they have yet to experience population aging themselves.
Young nations such as Mexico and Turkey should be particularly careful, due to their strong economic ties with NAFTA and the EU, where the gradual aging of populations is well under way.

Ethiopia’s New Climate of Fear
Vienna – The European Union, the United States, and other major donors will pump about $2.5 billion into Ethiopia this year, a sum that does not even begin to include the cost of medicines, famine relief, and countless other services provided by non-profit groups in one of the world’s most impoverished countries.
That help is needed, because Ethiopians are prone to malnutrition, disease, and natural calamity.
Its burgeoning population far outstrips the country’s ability to feed itself.
So desperate is Ethiopia that celebrity causes – from Bob Geldoff’s Live Aid famine-relief concerts to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s adoption of orphaned babies – supplement what donors cannot possibly provide.
But for all this generosity, an authoritarian government rules Ethiopia with virtual impunity.
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, in power for 18 years, has crushed the opposition.
His ruling party dominates public institutions.
Worse still, in a vast and predominantly rural country, the prime minister’s underlings control broadcasting and maintain a choke-hold on other media.
Four years ago this month, Zenawi’s Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Party (EPRDF) suffered its worst loss at the polls since the former guerrilla overthrew a ruthless, Soviet-backed regime in 1991.
Rather than accept its losses, the EPRDF-run government responded with a brutal crackdown, claiming outright victory and accusing the opposition of trying to stage an insurrection.
Security forces attacked peaceful protesters, jailed opposition leaders, sent thousands of their supporters to gruesome detention camps, and accused independent journalists of treason – a crime punishable by death.
Some journalists and politicians sought asylum in other countries.
During several months of unrest, roughly 200 people were killed.
It was a disgraceful snub for donor nations that had invested time and capital in supporting Ethiopia’s democratic transition.
Many of the journalists and opposition figures were eventually released or granted clemency, but there has been no letup to the torment.
In late April 2009, security forces arrested 40 opposition figures, accusing them of trying to topple the government.
Meanwhile, the authorities continue their assault on independent media through capricious licensing rules, interrogations, and, on occasion, revoking the permits of reporters for international broadcasters like the Voice of America.
Leading journalists have been assaulted, the culprits never found. “There is only fear, not freedom, of expression in Ethiopia,” says one leading journalist.
Ethiopia’s journalists are not entirely innocent.
Some newspapers have stoked the country’s ethnic and regional animosities, and can be wildly inaccurate in their reporting.
Yet badgering or jailing journalists is no way to resolve what could be handled through a voluntary media council or independent ombudsman.
Furthermore, the government effort to portray independent journalists as vicious enemies unfairly condemns the many Ethiopian reporters and editors who take their responsibilities seriously.
Zenawi has largely escaped sanction from his Western allies, in part because the erudite ex-Marxist had a friendly relationship with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and cooperated closely with the Bush administration in counter-terrorism efforts in the Horn of Africa.
There has not been total silence.
Donald Payne, a leading member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Ana Gomes, a member of the European Parliament from Portugal and head of the EU’s observation team in the 2005 elections, have sought to tie non-humanitarian aid more closely to Ethiopia’s conduct on press freedom and other human rights.
Britain and some other European governments responded to the post-election crackdown by temporarily withholding aid.
But Ethiopia poses a dilemma for anyone who cares about human rights and democracy.
Cutting off aid could have calamitous humanitarian consequences for the nation’s 80 million people.
It could also destabilize a fragile region, sparking fresh wars with neighboring Somalia and Eritrea.
Nevertheless, there are ways to pressure Zenawi:
· Donors should deny Ethiopian ministers a seat at diplomatic tables, such as the coveted spot Zenawi got at the G-20 summit in London as head of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development;
· While the Development Assistance Group, created by the EU and other principal donors to coordinate aid projects in Ethiopia, has improved the efficiency of donor contributions, a vigorous monitoring component is needed to ensure that international resources do not support policies that are anathema to human rights values;
· As a leading donor, the EU wields considerable power in Ethiopia and should be more willing to use it.
The EU should aggressively enforce the Cotonou Agreement, which requires Ethiopia and other nations that receive European assistance to respect “human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law.”
Cotonou is due for revision in 2010, so now is the time to develop enforcement mechanisms that establish clear penalties for failing to uphold human rights and freedom of the press.
· The EU and the US should wield more of their clout at the World Bank and other international organizations to link development grants to progress on press freedom and human rights.
The aid that Ethiopia receives from its friends may be a small price to pay to keep Africa’s second largest country from descending into chaos.
But Ethiopia’s people deserve more from their government.
Press freedom is a start, not just because it is a fundamental human right, but also because vigorous media are essential to keeping societies alert to the kinds of crises that are all too common in Ethiopia.

Japan’s Obama Problem
TOKYO – When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni Shrine last month, Chinese leaders predictably condemned his decision to honor those behind “the war of aggression against China.”
But Abe was also sending a message to Japan’s main ally and defender, the United States.
Faced with US President Barack Obama’s reluctance to challenge China’s muscle-flexing and territorial ambitions in Asia – reflected in Japan’s recent split with the US over China’s new Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) – an increasingly desperate Abe was compelled to let both countries know that restraint cannot be one-sided.
For China and South Korea, the Yasukuni Shrine’s inclusion of 14 Class A war criminals who were executed after World War II has made it a potent symbol of Japan’s prewar militarism, and Abe had long refrained from visiting it – including during his previous stint as prime minister.
He may well have maintained that stance had China not established the ADIZ, which set an ominous new precedent by usurping international airspace over the East China Sea, including areas that China does not control.
(Abe does not appear to have considered the possibility that his pilgrimage to Yasukuni might end up helping China by deepening South Korea’s antagonism toward Japan.)
The Obama administration had been pressing Abe not to aggravate regional tensions by visiting Yasukuni – an entreaty reiterated by Vice President Joe Biden during a recent stopover in Tokyo on his way to Beijing.
In fact, Biden’s tour deepened Japan’s security concerns, because it highlighted America’s focus on balancing its relationships in East Asia, even if that means tolerating an expansionist China as the strategic equivalent of an allied Japan.
Instead of postponing Biden’s trip to Beijing to demonstrate disapproval of China’s new ADIZ, the US advised its commercial airlines to respect it, whereas Japan asked its carriers to ignore China’s demand that they file their flight plans through the zone in advance.
By calling for Japanese restraint, the US stoked Japan’s anxiety, without winning any concessions from China.
Now, the widening rift between the US and Japan has become starkly apparent.
Abe feels let down by Obama’s decision not to take a firm stand on the ADIZ – the latest in a series of aggressive moves by China to upend the status quo in the East China Sea.
For its part, the US government openly – and uncharacteristically – criticized Abe’s Yasukuni visit, with its embassy in Japan releasing a statement saying that the US was “disappointed that Japan’s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan’s neighbors.”
Such recriminations do not mean that the US-Japan alliance – the bedrock of America’s forward military deployment in Asia – is in immediate jeopardy.
Japan remains a model ally that hosts a large US troop presence, even paying for the upkeep of American forces on its soil.
Indeed, Abe’s visit to Yasukuni came only a day after he completed a long-elusive, US-backed bilateral deal to relocate America’s airbase in Okinawa to a less populous area of the island.
And he supports Japan’s entry into the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, an emerging regional trading bloc that will exclude China.
Nonetheless, a psychological schism between the Abe and Obama administrations has gradually developed.
While the US frets about Abe’s nationalistic stance vis-à-vis China and South Korea, Japanese officials have stopped trying to conceal their uneasiness over Obama’s effort to strike a balance between its alliance commitments and its desire for Sino-American ties.
Biden spent more than twice as much time in discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping as he did with Abe.
The paradox is that while anxiety over China’s growing assertiveness has returned the US to the center of Asian geopolitics and enabled it to strengthen its security arrangements in the region, this has not led to action aimed at quelling China’s expansionary policies.
As a result, Japan is becoming skeptical about America’s willingness to support it militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands (called the Diaoyu Islands in China).
The Obama administration’s contradictory rhetoric – affirming that the US-Japan security treaty covers the Senkakus, while refusing to take a position on the islands’ sovereignty – has not helped.
A wake-up call for Japan was Obama’s inaction in 2012, when China captured the Scarborough Shoal, part of the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
In an effort to end a tense standoff, the US brokered a deal in which both countries agreed to withdraw their maritime vessels from the area.
But, after the Philippines withdrew, China occupied the shoal – and, despite a mutual-defense treaty between the US and the Philippines, the US did little in response.
This emboldened China effectively to seize a second Philippine-claimed shoal, part of the disputed Spratly Islands.
Factors like geographical distance and economic interdependence have made the US wary of entanglement in Asia’s territorial feuds.
And, unlike Asian countries, America would not really suffer from a Chinese “Monroe Doctrine” declaring that China would not accept any outside intervention in Asia.
But America’s neutrality on sovereignty disputes threatens to undermine its bilateral security alliances (which, by preventing countries like Japan from turning toward militarism, actually serve Chinese interests).
The Obama administration’s Asian balancing act obfuscates the broader test of power that China’s recent actions represent.
What is at stake are not merely islands in the East and South China Seas, but a rules-based regional order, freedom of navigation of the seas and skies, access to maritime resources, and balanced power dynamics in Asia.
By fueling Japanese insecurity, US policy risks bringing about the very outcome – a return to militarism – that it aims to prevent.

Climate Change vs. Techno-Utopia
BOSTON – Humanity has never faced a collective challenge as daunting as climate change.
Net global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions must be reduced to near-zero within the next three decades to give us even a fighting chance of keeping the temperatures within 2° Celsius of pre-industrial levels.
The further we exceed that threshold, the more likely we are to run into truly catastrophic scenarios.
With the United States back in the Paris climate agreement, this is the time for the world to reengage with these epochal challenges.
Bill Gates’s highly respected voice is thus a welcome addition to these efforts.
In his new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need, Gates argues that we need more experimentation with new ideas and technological innovations if we are to find a solution.
But his push for solar geoengineering is a step in the wrong direction, because it may undermine the incentives that are needed to meet the challenge of climate change.
The idea behind solar geoengineering is simple: If we cannot limit the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere, perhaps we can block the sunlight that generates heat, for example by creating a reflective cover.
Volcanic eruptions do this naturally.
Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, large amounts of sulfuric acid and dust settled into the stratosphere, temporarily reducing the amount of sunlight that the Earth received.
Over the next three years, temperatures dropped by about 0.5°C globally, and by 0.6°C in the northern hemisphere.
Many brilliant minds are now at work on solar geoengineering projects.
Scientists in Harvard University’s Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, for example, have proposed using calcium carbonate dust rather than toxic sulfate aerosols, but the overall idea is the same, and Gates himself has backed many of these technological efforts.
What could go wrong?
For starters, the risks associated with solar geoengineering are as profound as the potential benefits.
In addition to creating climatic instability, the Pinatubo eruption also appears to have accelerated the destruction of the ozone layer.
To have a meaningful effect on climate change, we would have to replicate that eruption’s effect on a much larger scale, inviting even greater climatic variability, including sharp temperature reductions in some parts of the world.
Because these effects would not be distributed evenly across countries and regions, we would also have to worry about increased geopolitical instability.
If a proposal has large potential benefits but also massive potential costs, the sensible thing to do is to conduct small-scale experiments into its viability – which is precisely what some Gates-backed ventures are now doing.
The problem is that small-scale experiments will not necessarily reveal the true costs, given the complexity of climate dynamics at the global level.
Creating a blanket of sun-blocking cloud dust might produce one effect at a small scale, and a completely different one at a larger scale.
Moreover, even if pursued with the best intentions, geoengineering has a dark side.
The more we believe in its effectiveness, the more we will reject tried-and-tested solutions such as a carbon tax and investments in renewable energy.
This is what economists call “moral hazard”: Once economic actors understand that they will not bear the costs of reckless behavior, reckless behavior becomes more likely.
In the context of fighting climate change, once governments know that there is a way to keep polluting without making the hard choices needed to avoid a disaster, they will refrain from making those choices.
Carbon taxes will be kicked down the road indefinitely, support for green research will be curtailed, and consumers will have little incentive to reduce their own carbon footprints.
This moral hazard is not just a theoretical curiosity.
For example, Gates himself suggests that even if a carbon tax could be introduced in the US, solar and wind energy will not be a sufficient solution.
But such thinking could be a fatal mistake.
It is easy to imagine how attractive this skepticism will sound to politicians who don’t want to pursue policies that will disrupt communities still relying on coal production.
But we should not discount the tremendous improvements in solar and wind’s cost-effectiveness.
And we must not ignore how much progress could be made by combining these energy sources with advances in storage technologies.
Moral hazard isn’t confined to governments.
My own research with Will Rafey of the University of California, Los Angeles finds that the pursuit of geoengineering may impede private-sector efforts to transition to clean energy.
Firms that have already begun to invest in renewables are operating on the assumption that there will be stronger climate regulations and a robust carbon-tax regime in the future.
Yet if we dangle the possibility that solar geoengineering will prevent global warming, they will start expecting a less regulation- and tax-driven response, and will curtail investment accordingly.
Ultimately, there is no easy way out and no alternative to carbon taxes and renewable energy if we want to avoid a climate disaster.
This message is lost in Gates’s enthusiasm for solar geoengineering.
But the longer we delay carbon taxes and the massive additional investments necessary for expanding renewable energy, the more difficult our future climate challenges will be.
Gates’s support for solar geoengineering is an expression of techno-utopianism.
Technology has to be part of the solution, but will not be a magical remedy for centuries of excessive carbon emissions.
The problem with techno-utopianism is that rather than accepting the need for costly investments and cultivating grassroots solutions from diverse perspectives, it seeks to find quick fixes and then impose them on society.
As the political scientist James C. Scott has shown, this perspective produced many social disasters in the twentieth century, and may do so again in its new enthusiasm for geoengineering.
One can already see the damage of techno-utopianism in fields such as artificial intelligence, where we are promised spectacular advances, but end up with large-scale algorithmic labor displacement or harmful discrimination.
This is also visible in health care, where the US spends massively – about 18% of GDP – in part owing to an emphasis on high-tech solutions rather than investments in public health, prevention, and comprehensive health insurance.
The result is poor health, despite high expenditures.
Climate change poses an even bigger challenge.
It is too important to be left to those promising a sweeping technological fix delivered, literally, from above.

Trading up Global Trade Talks
In the year since the breakdown of the trade talks in Cancun, sentiment has increasingly grown in the developing world that no agreement is better than a bad agreement.
But what would a good agreement look like?
The British Commonwealth recently posed this question to me and the Initiative for Policy Dialogue, an international network of economists committed to helping developing countries.
Our first message was that the current round of trade negotiations, especially as it has evolved, does not deserve even to be called a Development Round.
Well before the riots that marked the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle in 1999, I called for a true "development round" of trade talks to redress the inequities of previous rounds.
The advanced countries, with their dominant corporate and financial interests, had set the agenda for those negotiations.
Whether or not developing countries benefited was of little concern.
Indeed, in the last round of trade negotiations, the Uruguay Round, the world's poorest region, sub-Saharan Africa, was actually made worse off.
Our second message was optimistic: if the agenda of the current round is reoriented towards development, and if assistance is provided to manage implementation and adjustment costs, developing countries can gain much.
We analyzed which reforms in the international trade regime would most benefit those in the developing world, and we presented an alternative agenda based on our findings.
The results were perhaps obvious: more people live from agriculture in the developing world than from manufacturing, so agricultural liberalization must be high on the agenda.
But genuinely beneficial agricultural reform would need to go further than merely transforming export subsidies into other types of subsidies, because many supposedly non-distorting subsidies lead to more output, which hurts producers in developing countries by lowering prices.
Trade reforms must be sensitive to the effects on developing countries, many of which are net importers of subsidized agricultural commodities.
But some subsidies, like cotton subsidies in the United States, are rightly emblematic of America's bad faith.
Eliminating this subsidy would help 10 million poor cotton farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.
American taxpayers would also benefit.
The only losers would be the 25,000 rich farmers who currently divvy up $3-4 billion in government handouts each year.
Developing countries also need access for the unskilled labor-intensive services in which they have a comparative advantage.
These were off the agenda in earlier trade rounds, as the US pushed for liberalization of financial services - thus serving its own comparative advantage.
Today, unskilled services remain largely off the agenda.
Developing countries' alleged gains from capital market liberalization have been widely discussed (although recent studies raise some doubts about these benefits).
Nevertheless, the global gains from allowing freer flows of unskilled labor (even temporarily), let alone the benefits to developing countries, far outweigh the benefits from capital market liberalization.
But this issue too is not on the agenda.
The trade talks in Cancun raised new subjects - the so-called Singapore issues.
But even a cursory look at these items reveals that they primarily reflect the interests of developed countries.
Indeed, poor countries' development would arguably have been set back if they had acquiesced in some of the demands.
Consider the issue of government procurement.
The single largest area of US government procurement is defense, a sector in which even the European Union has found it difficult to make inroads.
Are developing countries really targeting this area in the next few years?
Clearly, this issue is not high on their agenda.
Competition is another example.
Without competition, lowering tariffs may merely be reflected in higher profit margins for a monopoly importer.
The most important competition issue for developing countries, however, is reform of dumping duties.
The US and EU keep out products from developing countries, alleging that they charge less than the cost of production.
But why would anyone knowingly sell at a loss?
This could only be rational if the seller can hope to establish a monopoly position and extract large profits in the future.
But few developing countries are in a position to establish such monopoly positions, so the dumping charges are mostly bogus.
As tariff barriers have come down, the unfair "fair trade" laws are increasingly being used as America's favored protectionist tool.
Treating foreign and domestic firms the same with respect to competitive practices would stop these abuses.
This, too, should be a high priority of a true development round.
The breakdown of the Cancun talks may yet provide an opportunity for deeper reflection.
Now that rich countries no longer need to worry about losing the developing world to Communism, they have an opportunity to redefine the global economic order according to the same principles on which they built successful national economies: fair competition and social justice.
Unfortunately, this opportunity was squandered in the Uruguay Round, as developed countries advanced their own interests at the expense of less developed countries.
The round of trade negotiations begun in Doha in November 2001 was launched in a different spirit.
It aspired to promote trade as a vehicle of partnership between developed and developing countries.
Regrettably, in spite of its name, the Development Round has offered far less to developing countries than one would have hoped.

Industrialization’s Second Golden Age
WASHINGTON, DC – “The golden age of finance,” the economist Barry Eichengreen has said, “has now ended.”
If that is true – and let us hope that it is – what follows will most likely be a new golden age of industrialization.
Historically, except for a few oil-exporting economies, no country has ever become rich without industrializing.
Thus, all eyes nowadays should be on our economies’ real sectors.
Confronted by the global financial crisis that looms over Europe, political leaders around the world are waking up to a stark new reality: unless the developed countries stop relying excessively on financial deal-making and start to rebuild from the ground up, they will lose their current standard of living.
The global community must look beyond the eurozone and sovereign-debt crises and pay attention to the opportunity of structural transformation in the developing world’s real sectors.
By structural transformation, I mean the process by which countries climb the industrial ladder – their workforces move into higher value-added manufacturing sectors as their sources of production advance.
Throughout 2011, I was struck by the potential for less-developed countries – including in Sub-Saharan Africa – to emulate successful industrializing East Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Vietnam.
Indeed, by focusing development efforts on the comparative advantages of poorer countries, we can rebuild confidence in the business sector and reinvigorate investment in job creation – not only in developing countries, but also in advanced economies.
The current global financial crisis, which is rooted in the advanced countries’ structural problems, requires investment and innovation policies, in addition to monetary or fiscal measures.
In advanced countries, research and development costs are quite high, because their technologies and industries are already in the vanguard.
By contrast, developing countries, including those in Sub-Saharan Africa, have the potential to expand their industrial sectors rapidly, because they can borrow technology from the advanced countries with little risk and at low cost.
So developing countries’ backwardness in terms of technology and industry means that they can grow for decades at an annual rate several times that of high-income countries before they close the income gap.
This May, in Maputo, Mozambique, I delivered the United Nations University’s annual WIDER lecture on development.
I explained how the winning formula for developing countries is to build up the same tradable industries that have been growing for decades in wealthier countries that have endowment structures similar to their own.
The pattern of flying geese is a useful metaphor to explain this idea.
Beginning in the eighteenth century, the less-developed West European and East Asian countries followed their more successful neighbors: emulating a flying-geese pattern, they benefited from the leaders’ tailwind as they first industrialized and then became advanced countries themselves.
Large, dynamic emerging-market economies (particularly Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that have industrialized quickly offer unprecedented opportunities for other developing economies to emulate their success – and thus to jumpstart their own industrialization processes.
China – once a “follower goose” – is on the verge of becoming a leader, with the potential to relocate 85 million low-skilled manufacturing jobs in the coming decade.
The scale of this shift is huge when compared with the 9.7 million jobs that Japan created in the modern sector in the 1960’s, or South Korea’s 2.3 million modern jobs in the 1980’s.
And a similar trend will arise in other emerging-market economies. In fact, it is already happening: China’s outward foreign direct investment reached $68 billion in 2010, exceeding that of Japan and the United Kingdom.
India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea are not far behind.
Moreover, India’s outward FDI is heavily concentrated in the manufacturing sector, accounting for 42.7% of the total in 1999-2008.
For developing countries to benefit fully from industrial upgrading in China and other large emerging-market economies, their governments must identify tradable industries that are consistent with their latent comparative advantage.
They also must help private firms to resolve information, coordination, and externality issues in the process of industrial upgrading.
Rapid industrialization in developing countries will require large imports of capital equipment from advanced countries.
Given that developing countries have accounted for as much as two-thirds of global growth in GDP and imports over the past five years, focusing on how to foster development in their industrial sectors could benefit advanced countries by helping to boost demand, thereby pulling the world out of its economic malaise.
In short, the imminent golden age of industrialization in developing countries will help to create jobs and spur recovery in advanced countries.
The benefits of this new era will be two-pronged: it will contribute to the achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals – the plan to cut world poverty in half by 2015 – and also will help to drive a global recovery.
Then, we may see a golden age for all.

Can America Escape the Stimulus Trap?
NEW YORK – As US President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package works its way through Congress, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers (a Democrat) and many Republicans argue that the plan is too big.
But perhaps a more important question is whether the United States is falling into a “stimulus trap,” and, if so, how to get out of it.
The Biden rescue plan is the federal government’s third attempt within a year to help the US economy recover from the pandemic-induced recession.
The previous two stimulus packages have caused asset prices, especially those of stocks and housing, to increase much faster than wages.
Because the rich hold more assets than the poor, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their income, America’s already large wealth gap will likely be widened further.
Rising inequality will spur demands to address it – including through higher tax rates, higher legally mandated minimum wages, and more generous social-transfer programs.
A proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour within four years, even if it does not become a part of this stimulus package, will likely receive more public and Congressional support once the facts about the widening wealth gap sink in with the public.
Raising the minimum wage is meant to help the poor.
But although the law can compel employers to pay workers at least the minimum wage, it cannot force them to hire people or to establish more businesses in low-wage sectors.
A $15 federal minimum wage would likely result in lower job creation than would otherwise be the case, especially in low-skill sectors.
Many would then cite the weak job market and economy as a reason for the next round of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies.
Of course, additional expansionary measures will fuel another wave of asset-price appreciation that outpaces average wage growth, further widening the wealth gap – and prompting calls for still higher taxes and minimum wages, and more social transfers, which would again weaken investment and job growth, justifying continued economic stimulus.
In other words, the US could become stuck in a stimulus trap.
Such a scenario is not inevitable.
But avoiding it will require three complementary reforms to accompany any economic stimulus.
First, America must upgrade its education system and strengthen the skills base, so that more workers can move into higher-paid jobs.
The aim should be to reduce job overlaps in tradable sectors with low-wage Chinese and Mexican workers and even lower-paid Indians or Vietnamese.
By doing this, the US can compete effectively with low-wage countries in the long term.
But policymakers first need to recognize that the low-skilled part of the US labor force is too large, and that America’s current education system, from kindergarten to high school, is failing children from low- and lower-middle-income households.
Better retraining programs for the existing labor force would also help.
Second, policymakers should aim to make labor markets more flexible while maintaining decent living standards for all Americans.
Here, we could learn from Denmark’s “flexicurity” model, which gives employers the flexibility to hire, fire, and adjust wages as market conditions change, but provides laid-off workers with a generous social safety net so that they can maintain a satisfactory livelihood.
The system’s flexible and reliable contractual work arrangements encourage entrepreneurs to create firms and jobs.
Comprehensive lifelong learning programs give workers an opportunity and incentive to improve their skills.
And the social security system provides adequate income support during employment transitions.
In a well-designed flexicurity system, minimum-wage increases need to be in line with both overall productivity gains and immigration policy.
A minimum-wage rise that exceeds the increase in productivity will create a two-tier labor market in which some fortunate low-skilled workers hold on to their jobs while many others are unable to find work at the legally mandated wage.
Similarly, setting a high minimum wage while easing immigration policy could lead to an influx of low-skilled immigrant workers.
If they find jobs in the grey market by offering to work for less than the legal minimum wage, things would become even more difficult for native-born low-skilled workers.
Just to be clear, I am not advocating eliminating immigration or wage growth, but rather emphasizing that wage growth, productivity growth, and immigration policy need to be considered simultaneously as different pieces of a common puzzle.
The third priority is to encourage US households in the middle and low-income brackets to save more by ensuring greater financial literacy and providing easier access to low-cost money management tools.
American households currently save about 12-14% of their income on average, a much lower share than in Germany, Japan, or China.
The problem is that Americans in the bottom 40% of the income distribution are hardly saving anything, which means their relative wealth lags further behind each time asset prices increase faster than wages.
To skeptics who think that low-income households are not making enough money to save, research suggests that they can and want to if they have the right knowledge and tools. If America saved more, it could also invest more, enabling the economy to grow a bit faster.
And that might reduce the dependence on stimulus packages in the future.

Brazil's Pioneering Solution to Vaccine Shortages
NEW YORK – The World Trade Organization was supposed to meet this week to consider a proposal that has been languishing for the past year: a temporary waiver of pharmaceutical intellectual property during the pandemic to allow poor countries to make many of the same tests, treatments, and vaccines that rich countries have had throughout the pandemic.
Yet, in a cruel reminder of the urgency of the problem, the WTO meeting was postponed, owing to the emergence of the Omicron variant, detected by scientists in South Africa (though precisely where it originated remains unclear ).
There is near-unanimous agreement that vaccinating the entire world is the only way to end the pandemic.
The higher the vaccination rate, the fewer chances the virus will have to acquire dangerous mutations.
Before quickly becoming the leading global variant, Delta was first detected in India, where under 3% of the population had been vaccinated.
Today, Africa has the world’s lowest vaccination rates, with only 7% of Africans having been fully vaccinated.
There is a simple reason why poorer countries don’t have enough vaccines: there aren’t enough doses to go around.
Donations haven’t solved the problem, because no country has surplus vaccines in the multiple billions that are needed.
Philanthropy, too, has fallen short.
The COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility, an international consortium that promised to send two billion vaccine doses to poor countries by the end of 2021, has shipped only 25% of that amount.
The world is not making as many vaccines as it could.
Every firm in every country that has the capacity to make vaccines should be doing so.
Yet after paying Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer/BioNTech to develop their vaccines, the US and German governments are unwilling to require these companies to share their technology with manufacturers in other countries.
Unless these governments change their position, the companies will continue to exploit the lucrative monopoly power granted to them by the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was created when the organization was formed in 1995.
According to WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the proposal for a TRIPS waiver is “stuck.”
Though the number of rich countries opposing it has dwindled, there is still enough opposition to thwart a solution.
But while the WTO dithers, Brazil has taken matters into its own hands, giving us the closest thing we have to a way out of this crisis.
In April, Brazilian Senator Paulo Paim proposed a bill that would allow the country to bypass the barriers erected by TRIPS.
The legislation seizes on the fact that, as the trade law scholar Frederick Abbott explained to us, “Article 73 of the TRIPS agreement, covering the protection of security interests, already provides each government with the authority to take whatever action it considers necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspending intellectual-property rights.”
If this option is already available, why are so many countries still waiting around for the WTO to grant them formal permission?
The answer is that ever since the WTO’s creation, rich countries have punished developing countries for doing what they are entitled to do under the organization’s own rules.
When South Africa, Brazil, India, and Thailand sought to override monopolies on unaffordable anti-retroviral drugs during the HIV/AIDS crisis, the United States and the European Union put them on trial – sometimes literally.
This history has created a chilling effect.
The current waiver proposal, therefore, would operate like a promise from the big kids not to bully the others during recess.
Brazil’s response represents another option: the bullying victims can take control of their own circumstances.
The new legislation attracted support from across the political spectrum, passing both the Brazilian House and Senate with large majorities.
Among other things, the bill sought to establish a permanent provision for overriding IP monopolies on essential technologies needed to address health emergencies (beginning with the COVID-19 pandemic).
And it would provide for the transfer of vaccine know-how – something like a manufacturing instruction manual – to alternative pharmaceutical manufacturers.
In September, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro signed the bill into law, but not before using his veto powers to remove or revise crucial clauses, including those specifying when and how the law would come into effect, and those requiring pharmaceutical companies to share their know-how, data, and biological material.
One month later, the Brazilian Senate recommended charging Bolsonaro with “crimes against humanity” for causing unnecessary loss of life in the pandemic.
But the charges did not include his mangling of the IP bill – an act that could lead to even more unnecessary loss of life.
The law returned to the Senate, which can override Bolsonaro’s vetoes.
But the Senate missed its deadline for rectifying the legislation, and then failed to set another.
It now must move quickly to eliminate the uncertainty created by Bolsonaro’s cuts, as well as withstand resistance by pharmaceutical-industry associations from the US and Europe, whose leaders tried to kill the bill, even threatening to cut off vaccine supplies if Brazil followed through.
Brazilian lawmakers must keep their eyes on the prize.
They have drafted a law that would dismantle the pharmaceutical monopolies that are blocking a solution to the pandemic.
There is a lesson here for everyone – both those asking the WTO for a waiver and those opposing it.
As goes Brazil, so will go others.
As for the world’s richest countries and the institutions beholden to them, it remains to be seen how much of their credibility they are willing to sacrifice in the service of enabling pharmaceutical companies to enjoy their monopoly profits just a bit longer.
We are fighting a war on two fronts: one against COVID-19, the other against the pharmaceutical companies whose profits depend on high prices and restricted output.
Sooner or later, we will realize, as Brazil already has, that we cannot prevail on the first front without winning on the second.

The Case for Mandating Climate-Risk Disclosure
DURHAM, NC/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, DC – Climate change is usually thought of as an environmental problem.
But it also poses serious threats to businesses, investors, and the financial system.
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently considering a proposal that would require certain publicly traded companies to disclose information relating to the risks they face from climate change.
Troublingly, the agency is coming under increasing pressure from a range of politicians and business interests who often cite the Supreme Court’s recent decision in West Virginia v. EPA as a reason to scrap or water down the proposal.
But the economic, legal, and political arguments against moving forward with this rulemaking are deeply misguided.
Climate risk – both the direct risks posed by unmitigated climate change and the risks businesses face from mitigation efforts – is financial risk.
Even as extreme events like hurricanes Fiona and Ian rightly get a lot of attention, rising average global temperatures and sea levels may ultimately have even larger economic effects.
Similarly, as governments, consumers, and business partners around the world seek to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, the risks facing certain carbon-intensive companies may be under-appreciated.
For example, global efforts to reduce carbon pollution will affect large emitters like utilities and cement companies, as well as companies selling products that generate significant emissions, like oil or vehicles with internal combustion engines.
In order to assess a company’s exposure to climate policy risk, investors need to know both its direct emissions and its “scope three” emissions from its upstream supply chain and downstream products.
Finally, there is broad concern that the collapse of a “carbon bubble,” or of insurance markets, or of coastal property values, could cascade through the economy, causing economic panic and distress.
Companies’ evaluation of how well they would survive such an episode is important investor information.
Some have suggested that the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA means that the SEC has no legal authority to require disclosure information related to climate-related risks, including emissions.
The Court applied a new version of the “major questions” doctrine, under which it will strike down an agency action, even if it has “a colorable textual basis,” if a majority of justices concludes that the agency’s action is novel in breadth, of economic and political significance, and not clearly authorized by Congress.
Applying this test, the Court held that by relying on a statutory provision that it had used only rarely for 50 years, and then only to require power plants to adopt pollution-control measures, the EPA was unlawfully trying to impose a cap-and-trade system that Congress had repeatedly declined to establish.
But the challenged rule in West Virginia is easily distinguishable from the SEC’s proposal for climate-risk disclosure.
The proposed rule rests on oft-used and well-understood congressional delegations of authority, does not involve novel claims of power, and does not expand the agency’s authority.
On the contrary, adopting standardized disclosure rules is central to the SEC’s mission of protecting investors and the public interest, and is well within the agency’s expertise.
One of the most fundamental roles that Congress has assigned to the SEC is to require firms to disclose information “material” to their operations in a form that allows investors to compare firms and make informed decisions.
These disclosures are not limited to financial information.
How could they be?
Firms face many kinds of risk, from both financial and non-financial sources.
Over the years, the SEC has required disclosure of a wide range of information pursuant to this standard.
In 1998, for example, the agency unanimously interpreted its rules to require firms to disclose risks from the Y2K computer bug.
Similar to the climate context, the SEC found that many companies had begun disclosing Y2K risks, but in varied forms that were difficult to compare and evaluate.
The SEC’s interpretation protected investors by identifying and standardizing the information firms had to provide.
The SEC’s proposal for climate-risk disclosure thus hardly breaks new ground.
It rests on well-established statutory authority and imposes the kind of requirement – standardized disclosure of material risks across firms – that has been the agency’s bread and butter for almost 90 years.
And many of America’s largest institutional investors, such as BlackRock and CalPERS, have gone on record arguing that they need mandatory climate-risk disclosure to do their jobs properly.
Moreover, and contrary to some suggestions, the proposal would not expand the breadth of securities laws beyond the entities such laws have historically covered.
To be sure, the proposed rule would require covered firms to estimate “scope three” emissions.
But it provides a safe harbor for firms so long as they provide good-faith estimates.
It would not require farmers or anyone else not covered by securities laws to disclose their emissions.
While the economic rationale and legal foundation for the SEC’s proposal are solid, regulatory decisions are unfortunately not entirely free of political considerations.
This was surely not lost on the conservative groups that developed and pushed the new version of the “major questions” doctrine.
They hoped the result of convincing the Supreme Court to invalidate agency action under this novel and vague interpretation would be to chill agency rulemaking activity.
Agencies, seeking to avoid potentially politically embarrassing losses in the courts, would be more likely to hesitate before moving forward.
For groups dedicated to the “deconstruction” of the “administrative state,” this outcome represents an even larger victory than any individual rulemaking that the courts might strike down.
The SEC and other federal agencies must not succumb to this chilling effect.
Where there is a strong factual basis and legal support for rulemaking, agencies should move forward with confidence.
Modern government – and the public interest – demands nothing less.

The Globalization of Mass Politics
Globalization has assumed a new form: global mass politics.
Of course, political protests have been global for decades, as past marches against the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, and globalization itself demonstrated.
The revolutions of 1989 and 1991 in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union blanketed a huge region within months.
But the anti-Iraq War protests reveal a new dynamic.
Up to 10 million protestors in some 60 countries and 600 cities took to the streets on schedule on a single day, February 15, showing that mass politics can now be approached globally.
Communications and mass media have long enabled "copycat" effects--protests in one place ignite similar actions elsewhere.
The overthrow of King Louis Phillipe in France in 1848 was carried by the recently introduced telegraph to Germany, igniting revolution.
Television images of the fall of the Berlin Wall spurred revolutionary changes throughout the former Soviet bloc.
On other occasions, protests such as May Day marches were transformed into widespread social mobilization, as happened in France on May 1, 1968.
What is distinctive about the recent mass protests against US plans for a war against Iraq is that the February 15 event was planned ahead of time, at short notice, for a specific date, and with an explicit goal of worldwide scale.
The decision to launch February 15 as a day of mass protest was apparently taken at a meeting of activists at the European Social Forum in Florence in November last year.
In ninety days, these organizers turned out more than 5 million protestors worldwide.
There are three keys to this phenomenon:
The Internet allowed for a rapid worldwide dissemination of organizational plans at an extraordinarily low cost to the organizers.
Mass action depended on local organizations seizing the initiative, based on a loose global plan.
This is what network theorists call "self-organizing" behavior.
As each unit took its own steps, these local actions were communicated to the rest of the world through Web sites that tracked and disseminated global plans, as well as offering information, advice, and encouragement.
A worldwide common concern: the prospect of an Iraq War.
There was a fourth specific feature fuelling the global protests, too: the exceptionally high level of arrogance and ineptitude displayed by the Bush Administration.
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld provoked the world's ire through a mocking disdain for global public opinion.
Rumsfeld's juvenile attack on "old Europe" no doubt helped bring millions into the streets.
Indeed, it's no longer possible in an age of mass communication to "play to the home audience" without the world also listening.
Bush's swaggering style plays well in Texas, but not in Paris and Berlin.
It is unlikely that worldwide protests will stop the Bush Administration's war plans, but they will help shape the political, security, and economic ramifications of such a war.
The war is likely to proceed because the US can carry out the military phase of the war largely on its own, and because the Bush Administration has no easy way to back down from its military mobilization.
Moreover, the uncertainties over war are hurting America's economy (and economies elsewhere), by causing a postponement of business plans and falling consumer confidence.
If today's stalemate drags on, the weak economy will threaten Bush's re-election bid in November 2004.
His political advisors may well advise him that it will soon be "now or never" to launch the war.
But America will pay dearly for launching a war against global public opinion.
Unless the Bush administration is vindicated in its actions--for example, if Saddam Hussein launches weapons of mass destruction that unite the world against him, or if the US discovers hidden nuclear weapons in the Iraqi desert--anti-American sentiments, and terrorism, unleashed by war, are likely to be massive.
America's people have never been told about the huge financial and political burdens that lie ahead, and they are not ready to bear them.
Already the US is facing huge fiscal deficits and a squeeze on popular programs, even before the costs of war and its aftermath are taken into account.
Cheap and instantaneous means of global communication are here to stay.
February 15 demonstrates that people throughout the world will use them to demand their right to help shape global political decisions.

Let the Negotiations Begin
Having successfully integrated ten new members in May – including eight former communist countries with significantly lower levels of economic development – some argue that the EU should stop there.
But drawing a line under the enlargement process would be both a missed opportunity for the EU and a cruel blow to those countries in the Balkans and elsewhere for whom the prospect of membership is an important incentive for reform and renewal.
Greece knows this very well.
It was our belief in Europe as a catalyst for peace and prosperity that led us to support Turkey’s EU aspirations.
When the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government launched its policy of Greek-Turkish rapprochement during my tenure as foreign minister, many people were suspicious of mending ties with an old enemy.
Changing entrenched attitudes could not happen overnight: it required a step-by-step process of confidence-building measures, from the grassroots level to the heights of political power.
Five years later, the results speak for themselves.
Greece and Turkey have signed eighteen mutually beneficial agreements in areas ranging from trade and energy, to environmental protection and the fight against organized crime.
There is no denying that strong bilateral ties are good for Greece’s economy and security.
But our proactive policy of rapprochement was not designed merely to serve national interests.
It was part of a regional vision to promote stability from the Balkans to the Middle East.
As a result, Greece and Turkey cooperated in humanitarian efforts in Kosovo and undertook a joint peace mission to Israel and Palestine.
Greece and Turkey also worked together to prevent the war in Iraq from spilling over into neighboring countries.
Greek-Turkish rapprochement has created the framework for closer relations between Turkey and the EU.
As a progressive party, PASOK has every interest in Turkey’s progress on democratic reforms.
That is why we have always supported a real rather than “virtual” European candidacy for Turkey – with full rights, but also with full responsibilities for completing the domestic reforms that have so far been implemented as a result of Turkey’s enhanced “Accession Partnership” with the EU.
Turkey’s governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) was elected on a pro-European platform, reflecting the public’s demand for modernization and democratization.
The biggest obstacles to membership are Turkey’s record on human and minority rights and the inordinate power of the military.
Clear EU benchmarks and targets for reform will help, but it is now up to the AKP government to show the necessary political will to fulfill its membership obligations.
However, Turks are all too aware of the passions that their country’s EU candidacy stokes in Europe.
Several EU leaders have claimed that Turkish membership would spark a wave of migration and strain the European economy.
Others see no place for a Muslim country in Europe.
None of these objections is persuasive.
If properly managed, migration can enhance Europe’s cultural wealth and meet its labor-market needs, as fertility rates in the EU fall and its population ages.
Immigrants come to Europe in large measure because Europe needs them.
At the same time, to deny Turkey a European future on religious grounds is to deny our Union’s diversity.
Democracy is a universal value, not the property of specific religions.
Moreover, welcoming a country like Turkey will send a positive signal to the Muslim world.
It will allay the growing tensions between Christianity and Islam fueled by international terrorism and knee-jerk nationalism.
Unlike the “war on terrorism,” European integration can serve as a model for resolving the underlying crises of the Middle East and addressing the roots of violence in the wider region.
In particular, the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul could be a great example of peaceful coexistence among Christians and Muslims.
For Orthodoxy, the Ecumenical Patriarchate is in many ways the equivalent of Mecca.
Allowing the Patriarchate to flourish, and reopening the Theological School on the island of Halki, would underscore Turkey’s progress on human and minority rights.
Turkey should view the Patriarchate not as a threat, but as an important asset ­– a bridge to Europe.
Similarly, Cyprus’s entry into the EU, coupled with Turkey’s EU aspirations, has created a unique catalyst for tearing down the “Berlin Wall” that runs through the capital, Nicosia, separating the island’s Christian and Muslim communities.
If Turkey is serious about joining the European family, it must recognize the Republic of Cyprus – like any other member state.
A road map must be drawn up for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus and a settlement of the political division of the island.
At Helsinki in December 1999, the EU agreed that Turkey must resolve its differences with its neighbors peacefully by the end of 2004, within the framework of EU and international law; otherwise, any outstanding dispute would be settled at the International Court of Justice.
The time has now come for the EU to assess Turkey’s progress on these issues and for Turkey to fulfill its obligations.
As negotiations proceed in the years ahead, it is in the international community's interest to support Turkey’s European future, while making a constructive contribution to end the division of Cyprus, so that the progress we have achieved is not lost.
From religious and ethnic conflict, Europe can once again forge a model of peaceful cooperation – this time by creating an integrated zone of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Economic Prosperity in the Digital Age
SAN JOSE – Around the world, people are demanding change.
Recent electoral outcomes – perhaps most notably, the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the presidential election in the United States – have highlighted rising economic uncertainty.
In this environment, it is imperative that leaders articulate and deliver on a clear vision for inclusive economic growth, one that accounts not only for tax and trade policy – the focus of many of today’s debates – but also for digitization.
Representing $19 trillion in potential economic value over the next decade, digitization has the power to enable countries to kick-start GDP growth, job creation, and innovation.
We’re already seeing the profound impact that digitization can have on countries that embrace it as a core driver of their economic strategies.
In India, for example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implementing a strategy that is transforming India into a technology powerhouse and setting the stage for a digital future.
In France, the government has invested in an extensive national digital plan that is expected to create 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years and contribute $101 billion to GDP over the next decade.
While other countries are embracing robust digital strategies, the US is falling behind.
Despite having led the Internet race in the 1990s, the US is now the only major developed economy without a clear digitization plan.
The consequences are already starting to show: according to the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index, the US is now the world’s eighth most innovative country, having fallen two spots since 2015.
The message is clear: when it comes to digitization, nobody is entitled to anything, and there is no time to waste.
Even in Silicon Valley, we must constantly reinvent ourselves to stay competitive.
The US economy must do the same, or risk losing its innovative edge.
Only with a clear and effective digitization plan can the US ensure that it retains its status as a global economic leader in the Digital Age, while fulfilling its citizens’ demands for more economic opportunities.
I believe that connectivity has the power to transform economies and generate new opportunities.
That is why America’s new digital agenda must rectify the fact that, despite living in one of the world’s wealthiest countries, one-third of the US population still lacks broadband access at home.
Existing Smart City initiatives promoting connectivity in Chicago and Washington, DC, are encouraging.
But, to close the digital divide, a more comprehensive national digital strategy is needed, one that emphasizes digital infrastructure investment, rather than just physical infrastructure investment, as in the past.
Only with broad access can technology continue to fulfill its potential as one of the great economic equalizers.
An effective US digitization plan must also support start-ups.
Young companies represent the future of job creation – they are the primary source of new jobs in the US – and technological disruption.
Yet start-ups are on the decline in the US.
According to research by the Brookings Institution, the start-up rate (the number of new companies, as a percentage of all firms) has fallen by nearly half since 1978.
To boost innovation and job creation, we need to reverse this trend, injecting more fuel into the US economy’s start-up engine.
This will require businesses and government to work together to create an environment that encourages entrepreneurs to bring their visions to life.
A combination of legislation, such as tax benefits for early-stage companies, and corporate/venture capital investments that provide financial backing and mentorship opportunities to start-ups, will be vital to sustain this ecosystem.
More broadly, US leaders must create an environment that encourages all kinds of business growth and investment.
Trump’s call to update US tax rules in 2017 could produce benefits on this front, assuming that the new rules promote domestic investment by encouraging companies to bring back their overseas earnings and by lowering the corporate tax rate, currently one of the highest among OECD countries.
These steps could bring more than $1 trillion into the US economy, creating jobs and economic opportunities in the process.
Yet another critical element of an effective digitization plan is education and training.
Businesses need to invest in the existing workforce, which largely lacks the skills necessary to compete in the Digital Age.
At the same time, we must transform our education system, so that younger generations acquire the skills they need to secure the high-paying digital jobs of the future.
To this end, we must move beyond emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics – the so-called STEM subjects – to think about how to apply technology and digitization to all fields.
Digitization could create $5.1 trillion in economic value for the US by 2025, while significantly lowering unemployment.
But the US cannot realize this potential unless its leaders work effectively across party lines and with all industries to drive forward a digital agenda.
Technology is changing everything: the way we do business, the rules of capitalism, and entire economic ecosystems – all at tremendous speed.
The US must change with it, acting now to do what it takes to reclaim its innovative edge and thrive in the Digital Age.

Closing the Health-Care Data Gap
BOSTON – While much of the world today suffers from information overload, there are still places where information is scarce.
And that scarcity sometimes costs people their lives.
In the maternity ward of Zanzibar’s largest public-health facility, Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, patient data are listed on a dry-erase board.
The information on the board consists of the number of women admitted, the type and severity of their conditions, and whether or not they survived.
These data may be better than nothing, but not by much.
There are no dates or timestamps or long-term filing systems.
With photographs of the board strictly forbidden, records last only as long as they are on it.
Zanzibar’s attitude toward health records is not unique.
In fact, Zanzibar is probably more careful than many other places throughout in Africa and Asia, where data-collection systems simply do not exist.
When a country suffers from such a data deficit, its public-health policies, budgets, and strategies are decided by political expediency or guesswork.
Sometimes the guesses are right, but most often they are not.
This is a major challenge for health-care systems in the developing world.
Collecting accurate information on all patients (while still respecting privacy) is vital to tracking public-health threats, lapses in care, and medical errors, and is a necessary and essential condition for holding open and honest debates about health-care issues that can affect entire communities or countries.
According to a British Medical Journal analysis by Martin Makary and Michael Daniel of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in the United States, medical errors alone are the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer.
In the context of their analysis, medical errors could include bad doctors, poor clinical judgment, miscommunications between staff members or departments, and incorrect diagnoses.
There is no reason to think this problem is confined to the US.
Health-care settings in the developing world often face even steeper challenges, such as lack of technical capacity among hospital management, staff shortages, poor training, low-quality medicines, and relative impunity for medical malpractice.
Unfortunately, because we have such limited data, we cannot know the extent to which any of these factors contribute to poor health outcomes and avoidable deaths in developing countries.
Aside from potentially saving countless lives, reliable data can reduce costs, financially and psychologically.
The financial burden of health care in low- and middle-income countries is substantial, despite the progress that has been made in fighting HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis.
Beyond these diseases, for which there is treatment and tracking, thanks partly to ample awareness, many illnesses go unidentified and continue to strain public-health services.
Understanding common causes of death is the only way to improve health care in communities with a high disease burden, patriarchal hierarchies, and large and dispersed rural populations that rely on traditional medicine.
In these settings, patient interactions with doctors are rare, so it is important to collect records on them at every opportunity.
Different societies have different health-care needs, and fully comprehending what they are is no easy task.
But we can begin the process with three steps.
The first is to create awareness within communities.
All people want healthy and productive lives for themselves and their loved ones, so they will welcome new insights into why people in their community die or get sick.
With the advent of citizen journalism and social media, even in poor countries, public-awareness campaigns are now more affordable than ever.
The second step is to devise better ways to collect data.
Many developing countries lack the funds, infrastructure, and training needed to use sophisticated data-collection tools; but that doesn’t mean they can’t make significant improvements in data collection.
As Atul Gawande of Harvard University’s School of Public Health has shown, simple checklists can be effective in both collecting data and making better decisions.
If health-care workers and policymakers know which data are useful and why, they will already be in a better position to change public-health outcomes.
The final step is to establish transparent oversight of the data being collected.
Some data may point to politically inconvenient or counterintuitive conclusions, and politicians could be tempted to sweep it under the rug.
In the age of social media and open-access journals, we should demand that newly collected data be made available to a broad range of people researching public-health issues and working in health-care settings.
Ultimately, we may not be able to prevent deaths caused by certain illnesses.
But with more information, it is within our power to prevent those deaths that are caused by our own complacency or incompetence.

The Future of Tech Policy
STANFORD – Technology and the largest tech firms are becoming increasingly controversial.
Today, there are growing concerns about third parties accessing and manipulating Facebook user data; and before that, there was a raging debate about whether the government should be able to unlock devices belonging to suspects of terrorism or other crimes.
More broadly, technology-driven job dislocation has become a source of constant anxiety.
For all of these reasons, technology policy has taken center stage, as I predicted it would exactly one year ago.
Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently conceded in congressional testimony that some regulation of his industry is necessary, and there is now an open window of opportunity to pursue new policies for the sector.
In formulating such policies – whether through legislation, regulatory rule-setting, international agreements, or measures addressing related issues such as tax and trade – the goal should be to limit the downsides of technology without stifling innovation.
To that end, five interrelated issues should be kept in mind.
The first is privacy.
Although the European Union’s far-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into force on May 25, it will not offer any protection for non-Europeans.
In the case of Facebook, that translates into 1.5 billion users, almost all of whom have clicked to agree to the company’s terms of service without having read them.
There are currently proposals to require tech companies to obtain an affirmative opt-in from users before collecting their data, and to allow users to retrieve or erase their data easily.
How customers and companies, including new entrants, would react to such rules remains to be seen.
To collect more data, firms might offer users inducements beyond the putatively free services they already provide, and that may or may not slow down the pace at which they can enhance services or add newfeatures.
The second issue is market power.
In the early years of the Internet, an infant tech industry pled for a hands-off approach to regulation and taxation.
But now, the four largest US firms by market capitalization – Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon – are all tech companies (as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway had edged out Facebook for fifth place).
Devising sensible policies on this front will require that we first define the market, and then decide what level of concentration, and over what time frame, constitutes a threat to competition.
The tech sector seems to follow a classic pattern of Schumpeterian creative destruction, whereby successive waves of monopoly ascension give way to displacement: cell phones replaced landlines; email displaced postal mail; and social media and texting are supplanting phone calls.
Currently, Apple and Google hold a duopoly on smartphone operating systems, yet they compete vigorously to improve their features and roll out new products.
Meanwhile, the iOS and Android app stores have become both a point of entry for many small businesses and a barrier to entry for new smartphone providers.
Likewise, Facebook and Google dominate the digital advertising market, but their profits allow them to offer ostensibly free email and social-media services that benefit consumers.
Elsewhere, the US government is trying to block a merger between the telecom giants AT&T and Time Warner, which owns a movie studio, cable television stations, and print publications.
Whereas regulators worry that the merger would lead to higher prices, AT&T argues that it is facing direct competition from tech giants like Netflix and Amazon, which both offer online video streaming and original programming.
(Amazon is also dominant in online retail and data-center infrastructure.)
The question, then, is whether the current competition among the behemoths more than offsets their market power.
A third issue concerns the control of information.
Owing to the convenience and addictiveness of smartphones and social media, many people now get news exclusively from online platforms like Facebook.
And yet the microtargeted advertising model used by Google and Facebook has disrupted print journalism’s traditional source of revenue, along with coverage of state and local governments.
Even worse, social-media algorithms tend to amplify the most extreme material at the expense of more credible sources.
But efforts to eliminate material viewed as extreme by some will raise the specter of censorship.
Conservatives, especially, fear that left-leaning companies in Silicon Valley will be allowed to decide what counts as acceptable debate.
The fourth issue is the concentration of wealth.
The founders of today’s tech giants are now among the world’s wealthiest people, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos topping the list.
But their growing fortunes stand in stark contrast to decades of slow wage growth, which is creating a political backlash.
Still, the creative destruction of the digital era has also enriched many tech workers and investors, while reducing the fortunes of previous incumbents.
It has both destroyed and created well-paying jobs.
And, most important, it has produced goods and services that make virtually all of us better off.
Policies to address distributional concerns should not suppress entrepreneurship or discourage work, saving, and investment, especially for new market entrants.
For example, a capital-gains tax, whatever its distributional intent, amounts to a tax on becoming rich.
And yet creating incentives for people to improve their lot is what drives broad-based prosperity.
The last issue concerns national security and national economic interests.
This month, a number of tech firms, including Microsoft and Facebook, declared that they will not assist any government in conducting offensive cyberwarfare operations, and that they will defend unconditionally any countries or individuals targeted by a cyber attack.
Does that really include a cyber attack against North Korea or Iran to preempt a nuclear event?
With respect to economic interests, all governments look for ways to help their countries’ own industries, whether through regulation, subsidies, or trade barriers.
But China has been playing a different game with its alleged theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers.
With China expanding its cyberwarfare capabilities and investing in vital telecom infrastructure, the US government recently saw fit to bar US firms from selling components to the Chinese telecom giant ZTE.
In response, China is now holding up the US chipmaker Qualcomm’s acquisition of the Dutch semiconductor firm NXP.
All of these issues will shape the future of tech policy, and thus future innovations and the benefits they bring to society.

Turkey’s Rise and the Decline of Pan-Arabism
TEL AVIV – The deadly fiasco of the Turkish-led “peace flotilla” to Gaza highlighted the deepening strain in the Israeli-Turkish alliance.
But it mainly helped expose the deeper, underlying reasons for Turkey’s shift from its Western orientation toward becoming a major player in the Middle East – in alliance with the region’s rogue regimes and radical non-state actors.
Foreign policy cannot be separated from its domestic foundations.
The identity of nations, their ethos, has always been a defining motive in their strategic priorities.
Israel’s blunders did, of course, play a role in the erosion of its alliance with Turkey.
But the collapse of its old “alliance of the periphery,” including Turkey, the Shah’s Iran, and Ethiopia, had more to do with revolutionary changes in those countries – the Ayatollah Khomeini’s rise to power, the end of Emperor Haile Selassie’s regime, and now Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Islamic shift – than with Israeli policies.
The current crisis reveals the depth of Turkey’s identity complex, its oscillation between its Western-oriented Kemalist heritage and its Eastern Ottoman legacy.
Snubbed by the European Union, Erdogan is tilting the balance towards the latter.
Kemalism always saw the Ottoman legacy as a burden, an obstacle to modernization.
In Erdogan’s vision, modernization does not preclude a return to Turkey’s Islamic roots, nor does it require it to abandon its destiny as a Middle East power, even if this means flouting United States-led policies in the region.
Indeed, Erdogan responded positively to Europe’s conditions for Turkey’s EU membership.
His reforms – economic liberalization, cooperation with the European Court of Human Rights, improving the Kurdish minority’s rights, and undercutting the army’s Praetorian ambitions – are major advances in the history of the Turkish Republic.
Yet Erdogan has also been eager to use Europe’s requirements as a pretext to curb the army’s capacity to check his Islamic revolution.
The election of his political ally, Abdullah Gul, as president, against the army’s will – indeed, against the entire Kemalist tradition – is a case in point.
To block a move aimed at outlawing his Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan also domesticated Turkey’s constitutional court – together with the army a watchdog of Kemalism – by arbitrarily changing its composition.
Now a constitutional reform supposedly aimed at “promoting Turkey’s EU membership” would further curb the army’s role as the guardian of the secular state and strengthen government control of the judiciary.
Erdogan’s Islamic revolution has also expanded into the educational system with the introduction of a markedly religious curriculum.
To back Turkey’s strategic shift, a new law has recently made the teaching of Arabic obligatory in schools.
It is difficult to imagine a more symbolic blow to Ataturk’s vision.
Erdogan believes that, by exercising Turkey’s capacity for mediation, he will recover the burden of his Ottoman forbears as the guarantors of peace and security in the Mashreq.
Turkey’s drive to serve as a peace broker between Israel and its Arab enemies, Erdogan’s vociferous championship of the Palestinian cause, and his pretension to be the mediator in the nuclear dispute between Iran and the West reflect Turkey’s changing perceptions of itself as a regional leader.
To both Israel and the West, the regional context of Turkey’s rise is especially disturbing.
Erdogan’s neo-Ottomanism is not a return to an idyllic Ottoman Commonwealth; it is more a clash between a rising radical axis, led by two major non-Arab powers (Turkey and Iran), and the declining Arab conservative regimes.
Turkey put Israel in the dock of world opinion over the “peace flotilla” in a way that might still force Binyamin Netanyahu’s government to opt for credible peace negotiations, while providing a boost to Hamas and bringing about the imminent end of Iarael’s Gaza blockade.
Such a spectacular success only serves to highlight the impotence of the West’s Arab allies.
Indeed, Turkey’s growing regional relevance is the measure of the Arabs’ failure.
They failed to advance their peace initiative with Israel, and are complicit in the blockade of Gaza in the hope that Hamas will collapse, thereby humbling their own Islamist oppositions.
As Islamist democracies whose governments emerge from popular elections, Iran and Turkey – and their Hamas and Hezbollah allies – can claim an advantage over the incumbent Arab regimes, all of which suffer from a desperately yawning legitimacy deficit.
They are all secular autocracies kept in power by intrusive, all-powerful intelligence services.
Erdogan’s strategy makes him complicit with the agenda of the West’s most vicious enemies.
He even flirted with Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir’s perverted Islamist rule, welcoming Bashir to Turkey after he was indicted by the International Criminal Court for massacres in Darfur on the grounds that “Muslims do not commit genocide.”
Iran and Turkey are bound to assert their Islamic credentials more and more as they reach out to the Arab masses.
That a pan-Islamic discourse has now replaced the cause of pan-Arabism is a major setback for moderate Arab regimes.
Yet, despite Erdogan’s creeping Islamic revolution, Turkey is not a second Iran.
The AKP remains a progressive, heterogeneous party that sees no contradiction between Islam and democracy.
Nor has it entirely given up on Turkey’s European dream.
Moreover, an increasingly robust secular opposition, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) under the vigorous leadership of Kemal Kilicdaroglu, is bound to help stem the Islamist tide.
With Israel’s return to a sober peace strategy, and with an honest dialogue between Turkey and its NATO allies, the Turkish bridge between East and West can still be salvaged.

Next Steps for a People’s Vaccine
NEW DELHI – The Biden administration’s decision to stop opposing a proposed COVID-19 waiver of certain intellectual-property rights under World Trade Organization rules is a welcome move.
The US Trade Representative acknowledges that “the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures.”
While affirming that it “believes strongly in intellectual property protections,” the Biden administration, “in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines.” Already, the US decision may be persuading other rich-country holdouts in Europe and elsewhere to follow suit.
While the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines was a truly impressive achievement, it has been tarnished by constraints on global vaccine supply and the related inequities in distribution.
As of May 4, less than 8% of the world’s population had received even one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, while just ten rich countries accounted for 80% of all vaccinations.
The reason is not just that rich countries have been buying up all available doses; it is also that there simply have not been enough doses to go around.
But this scarcity itself is largely artificial.
Vaccine production has been limited by pharmaceutical companies’ refusal to share knowledge and technology.
Though the companies producing the approved vaccines have benefited from public subsidies and publicly funded research, they nonetheless have taken advantage of patent protections to maintain a monopoly, limiting production to their own factories and a select few other companies to whom they have granted licenses.
These patents are enshrined and enforced internationally through the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which allows for action to be taken against countries that provide compulsory licenses allowing “someone else to produce a patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.” It is this threat of legal action that led a majority of WTO members to propose a temporary waiver for COVID-19 drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and other technologies needed to fight the pandemic.
And yet, even this minor step has been blocked in the WTO TRIPS Council, because (mostly) rich countries have been prioritizing big pharmaceutical companies’ interests over global health.
A waiver has become all the more urgent with the coronavirus on the rampage across South America and India, where a near-complete breakdown of overstretched health services is resulting in a catastrophic loss of life.
Worse, the rapid spread of the virus has already given rise to dangerous new variants.
We absolutely must vaccinate as many people as possible before vaccine-resistant variants emerge.
Temporarily waiving IP rights is essential, but it is only the first step.
A waiver agreement would address the previously insurmountable legal side of the problem.
But much more will need to be done to make a “People’s Vaccine” universally available as soon as possible.
The next step is to push for concrete measures to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and technology.
From Canada to Bangladesh, many potential vaccine producers with the required facilities have so far been denied the licenses and technical know-how to proceed.
Not a single pharmaceutical company has joined the World Health Organization’s voluntary facility for sharing technology, the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP).
Governments in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, having given large subsidies to develop the approved vaccines, can and should pressure the companies to share the knowledge that public money helped provide.
We know this can be done, because the Biden administration has already persuaded Johnson & Johnson to share its technology with Merck to boost domestic production of its single-dose vaccine.
Surely the other companies that have benefited from public support could be pressured to do the same with producers around the world.
In the meantime, the TRIPS waiver could increase vaccine production in other ways as well.
Moderna, which relied almost completely on US government funding, has already declared that it will not enforce its patent.
But its mRNA vaccine uses some knowledge that it has licensed (and paid for) from other companies, which could in turn sue any other producer using the same technology.
The TRIPS waiver would eliminate this possibility, allowing production to be scaled up rapidly.
With Moderna now indicating that it will produce three billion doses in 2022 alone, the mRNA vaccines are apparently quite amenable to expanded production.
They are also said to be easily adapted to account for new variants.
The case for public production of such vaccines is clear.
“For less than the US government spends on the COVID-19 response daily,” notes the health advocacy organization PrEP4All, “it can build a facility to produce enough mRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity to vaccinate the entire world in one year, with each dose costing only $2.”
The case for public production becomes even stronger when one considers that private vaccine producers have little financial incentive to meet current global needs.
Once the pandemic is contained, the demand for vaccines is likely to revert to much lower “normal” levels.
To win the race against the virus, we must build and deploy public manufacturing capacities in the US and other countries.
And when COVID-19 is brought to heel, these facilities should be maintained for future pandemics.
The world desperately needs the TRIPS waiver and stronger measures to ensure the transfer of knowledge and technology to produce COVID-19 vaccines.
But we also need to start preparing for equally exceptional circumstances in the future.
The knowledge on which our health and prosperity depend must be both publicly funded and publicly disseminated.

Putting the Populist Revolt in Its Place
CAMBRIDGE – In many Western democracies, this is a year of revolt against elites.
The success of the Brexit campaign in Britain, Donald Trump’s unexpected capture of the Republican Party in the United States, and populist parties’ success in Germany and elsewhere strike many as heralding the end of an era.
As Financial Times columnist Philip Stephens put it, “the present global order – the liberal rules-based system established in 1945 and expanded after the end of the Cold War – is under unprecedented strain.
Globalization is in retreat.”
In fact, it may be premature to draw such broad conclusions.
Some economists attribute the current surge of populism to the “hyper-globalization” of the 1990s, with liberalization of international financial flows and the creation of the World Trade Organization – and particularly China’s WTO accession in 2001 – receiving the most attention.
According to one study, Chinese imports eliminated nearly one million US manufacturing jobs from 1999 to 2011; including suppliers and related industries brings the losses to 2.4 million.
As the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton argues, “what is crazy is that some of the opponents of globalization forget that a billion people have come out of poverty largely because of globalization.” Even so, he adds that economists have a moral responsibility to stop ignoring those left behind.
Slow growth and increased inequality add fuel to the political fire.
But we should be wary of attributing populism solely to economic distress.
Polish voters elected a populist government despite benefiting from one of Europe’s highest rates of economic growth, while Canada seems to have been immune in 2016 to the anti-establishment mood roiling its large neighbor.
In a careful study of rising support for populist parties in Europe, the political scientists Ronald Inglehart of the University of Michigan and Pippa Norris of Harvard found that economic insecurity in the face of workforce changes in post-industrial societies explained less than cultural backlash.
In other words, support for populism is a reaction by once predominant sectors of the population to changes in values that threaten their status. “The silent revolution of the 1970s appears to have spawned an angry and resentful counter-revolutionary backlash today,” Inglehart and Norris conclude.
In the US, polls show that Trump’s supporters are skewed toward older, less-educated white males.
Young people, women, and minorities are under-represented in his coalition.
More than 40% of the electorate backs Trump, but with low unemployment nationally, only a small part of that can be explained primarily by his support in economically depressed areas.
On the contrary, in America, too, there is more to the resurgence of populism than just economics.
A YouGov poll commissioned by The Economist found strong racial resentment among supporters of Trump, whose use of the “birther” issue (questioning the validity of the birth certificate of Barack Obama, America’s first black president) helped put him on the path to his current campaign.
And opposition to immigration, including the idea of building a wall and making Mexico pay for it, was an early plank in his nativist platform.
And yet a recent Pew survey shows growing pro-immigrant sentiment in the US, with 51% of adults saying that newcomers strengthen the country, while 41% believe they are a burden, down from 50% in mid-2010, when the effects of the Great Recession were still acutely felt.
In Europe, by contrast, sudden large influxes of political and economic refugees from the Middle East and Africa have had stronger political effects, with many experts speculating that Brexit was more about migration to Britain than about bureaucracy in Brussels.
Antipathy toward elites can be caused by both economic and cultural resentments.
The New York Times identified a major indicator of Trump-leaning districts: a white-majority working-class population whose livelihoods had been negatively affected throughout the decades in which the US economy shed manufacturing capacity.
But even if there had been no economic globalization, cultural and demographic change would have created some degree of populism.
But it is an overstatement to say that the 2016 election highlights an isolationist trend that will end the era of globalization.
Instead, policy elites who support globalization and an open economy will have to be seen to be addressing economic inequality and adjustment assistance for those disrupted by change. Policies that stimulate growth, such as infrastructure investment, will also be important.
Europe may differ because of heightened resistance to immigration, but it would be a mistake to read too much about long-term trends in American public opinion from the heated rhetoric of this year’s election campaign.
While the prospects for elaborate new trade agreements have suffered, the information revolution has strengthened global supply chains and, unlike in the 1930s (or even the 1980s), there has not been a reversion to protectionism.
In fact, the US economy has increased its dependence on international trade. According to World Bank data, from 1995 to 2015, merchandise trade as a percentage of total GDP has increased by 4.8 percentage points.
Moreover, in the age of the Internet, the transnational digital economy’s contribution to GDP is rapidly increasing.
In 2014, the US exported $400 billion in information and communication technologies (ICT)-enabled services – almost half of all US services exports.
And a poll released last month by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations found 65% of Americans agreeing that globalization is mostly good for the US, while 59% say that international trade is good for the country, with even stronger support among the young.
So, while 2016 may be the year of populism in politics, it does not follow that “isolationism” is an accurate description of current American attitudes toward the world.
Indeed, in crucial respects – namely, on the issues of immigration and trade – Trump’s rhetoric appears to be out of step with most voters’ sentiments.

Saigon's Fall, Saigon's Rebirth: 25 Years Later
Vietnam's long war ended 25 years ago, on April 30, 1975.
Like a passerby staring at the wreckage of a road accident, I watched the fall of Saigon on television in Connecticut with my new family.
Like millions of Americans, I was mesmerized by the collapse of a country where half-a-million American soldiers fought and 50,000 died.
I was lucky.
Barely twelve, I left Saigon a month before its fall with an American officer whom I had befriended in an army hospital, where my mother and I volunteered.
That was 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive.
We brought him rice porridge, chocolate eclairs, tamarind candy.
He spoke French with me.
As he lay bandaged, I told stories that made him laugh.
Seven years later, as North Vietnamese tanks crossed the DMZ, he returned and adopted me, taking me out several months before my parents made their own escape.
From the safety of our living room we watched as crowds of Vietnamese forced their way into the guarded US compounds.
Helicopters skittered on the Embassy's rooftop.
This was ‘Operation Frequent Wind,' code-name for America's evacuation from Saigon.
There was an exodus by air, towards the Seventh Fleet patrolling the South China Sea; an exodus by sea saw waves of barges, fishing boats and other makeshift vessels.
More than 100,000 Vietnamese fled in April and May of 1975 alone, a number swelling to 2 million in the years after.
Wars are often incomprehensible to those who live through them.
The beginning; the end; the beginning of the end: these are historians' questions.
Those who survived the war in Vietnam and fled because we were suddenly on history's losing side, grappled with questions of forgetting, of how to live an unremembered life – unremembered until an anniversary like this one.
April 30: the Day of Liberation as it is known in Communist Vietnam; the Day of National Loss, as Vietnam's exiles call it.
Reinvented by Hollywood for American self-examination, recrimination, and regret, Vietnam became an allegorical black hole.
In films like Apocalypse Now and Platoon, shadowy enemies lurk in an hallucinatory darkness of fetid swamps and jungles.
Symbols of disillusion abound in Born on the Fourth of July, where a flag-waving patriot is transfigured into an antiwar demonstrator.
The Deer Hunter conceives of Vietnam as a metaphor for insanity, the arbitrary click of a gun in a game of Russian roulette signaling the difference between life and death for American GIs addicted to the madness of war and hell in a very small place.
Years after the war, Vietnam remained a buzzword for something else, never for itself; a short-hand for disaster.
But for us Vietnamese who made America our new country, Vietnam remains home, a place of controlled forgetting and even more controlled remembering.
In that grey space between remembering and forgetting, most of us invented new lives.
So, for many Vietnamese, April 30 is a day of re-invention and rebirth.
Twenty five years after Saigon's fall, most of us have inched away from the margins of American life.
We learned English, managed America's raucous sounds, even as we preserved our multiple versions of the old.
Across America, in Orange County in California, in Houston and Dallas, Arlington and Falls Church, Virginia, Saigon has been resurrected.
In these "Little Saigons," mini- malls are filled with American-style Vietnamese supermarkets, restaurants, bakeries, nail and hair salons, medical and law offices, travel agencies, and every type of service business.
Ice cream parlors are called "Givrard" and "Brodard", and restaurants "Pasteur," after those once frequented in Saigon.
South Vietnam's flag of yellow with three red horizontal stripes often flies side-by-side with the Star-Spangled banner.
Vietnam remembered remains the stuff of dreams, a voluptuous mix of reproduced scent and sound.
For the generation raised as hyphenated Americans, Vietnam hovers in the recesses of their lives, through stories told by parents and, increasingly, in this technological age, with a click to such websites as ‘Viet.story', ‘Viet.travel', etc.
VC nowadays means not Vietcong, but venture capitalist.
Twenty five years after the exodus from Vietnam, a reverse exodus is taking place.
The Viet Kieu, as the Vietnamese diaspora is called, are returning by the thousands, bringing to Vietnam the precious American dollar.
There, we find ice cream parlors called "Baskin-Robbins," restaurants owned by locals called "Café California," and bars with names like "Apocalypse Now."
For those left behind, it is America that is the stuff of dreams, the American passport that is admired.
In Ho Chi Minh City, a name not even Communist officials use, Saigon remains its old brash, energetic, and audacious self.
In the city that bears his name, Ho Chi Minh is more or less ignored, although his portraits loom alongside Sony and Coca Cola signs.
Before 1986, it was a crime to own a private business.
As a result of economic reforms, the private economy, especially in Saigon, surpasses the official state economy.
In the city's markets, on sidewalks and in alleyways, everyone peddles something.
After twenty five years of collapsed expectations, you feel a raw energy in the roar of motorbikes that weave through improvisational waves of traffic, in the spirit of a city revived.
Four years ago, I gave a series of lectures at the invitation of the Ministry of Education and squeezed in a visit with my uncle, a Vietcong who stayed behind after the Communist victory.
What he wanted to learn was how his Mekong Delta province could attract some of the foreign investment going mostly to Saigon.
Hanoi's officials, too, resent that investors fly to their city to get approval for deals, only to do business in the South.
April 30 is indeed called the Day of Liberation in Vietnam: 1.5 million Vietnamese died during that war; 3 million were wounded.
But as my uncle suggests, perhaps it was the South that ultimately liberated the North.

The New Mercantilist Challenge
CAMBRIDGE – The history of economics is largely a struggle between two opposing schools of thought, “liberalism” and “mercantilism.”
Economic liberalism, with its emphasis on private entrepreneurship and free markets, is today’s dominant doctrine.
But its intellectual victory has blinded us to the great appeal – and frequent success – of mercantilist practices.
In fact, mercantilism remains alive and well, and its continuing conflict with liberalism is likely to be a major force shaping the future of the global economy.
Today, mercantilism is typically dismissed as an archaic and blatantly erroneous set of ideas about economic policy.
And, in their heyday, mercantilists certainly did defend some very odd notions, chief among which was the view that national policy ought to be guided by the accumulation of precious metals – gold and silver.
Adam Smith’s 1776 treatise The Wealth of Nations masterfully demolished many of these ideas.
Smith showed, in particular, that money should not be confused for wealth. As he put it, “the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds.”
But it is more accurate to think of mercantilism as a different way to organize the relationship between the state and the economy – a vision that holds no less relevance today than it did in the eighteenth century.
Mercantilist theorists such as Thomas Mun were in fact strong proponents of capitalism; they just propounded a different model than liberalism.
The liberal model views the state as necessarily predatory and the private sector as inherently rent-seeking.
So it advocates a strict separation between the state and private business.
Mercantilism, by contrast, offers a corporatist vision in which the state and private business are allies and cooperate in pursuit of common objectives, such as domestic economic growth or national power.
The mercantilist model can be derided as state capitalism or cronyism.
But when it works, as it has so often in Asia, the model’s “government-business collaboration” or “pro-business state” quickly garners heavy praise.
Lagging economies have not failed to notice that mercantilism can be their friend.
Even in Britain, classical liberalism arrived only in the mid-nineteenth century – that is, after the country had become the world’s dominant industrial power.
A second difference between the two models lies in whether consumer or producer interests are privileged.
For liberals, consumers are king.
The ultimate objective of economic policy is to increase households’ consumption potential, which requires giving them unhindered access to the cheapest-possible goods and services.
Mercantilists, by contrast, emphasize the productive side of the economy.
For them, a sound economy requires a sound production structure. And consumption needs to be underpinned by high employment at adequate wages.
These different models have predictable implications for international economic policies.
The logic of the liberal approach is that the economic benefits of trade arise from imports: the cheaper the imports, the better, even if the result is a trade deficit.
Mercantilists, however, view trade as a means of supporting domestic production and employment, and prefer to spur exports rather than imports.
Today’s China is the leading bearer of the mercantilist torch, though Chinese leaders would never admit it – too much opprobrium still attaches to the term.
Much of China’s economic miracle is the product of an activist government that has supported, stimulated, and openly subsidized industrial producers – both domestic and foreign.
Although China phased out many of its explicit export subsidies as a condition of membership in the World Trade Organization (which it joined in 2001), mercantilism’s support system remains largely in place.
In particular, the government has managed the exchange rate to maintain manufacturers’ profitability, resulting in a sizable trade surplus (which has come down recently, but largely as a result of an economic slowdown).
Moreover, export-oriented firms continue to benefit from a range of tax incentives.
From the liberal perspective, these export subsidies impoverish Chinese consumers while benefiting consumers in the rest of the world.
A recent study by the economists Fabrice Defever and Alejandro Riaño of the University of Nottingham puts the “losses” to China at around 3% of Chinese income, and gains to the rest of the world at around 1% of global income.
From the mercantilist perspective, however, these are simply the costs of building a modern economy and setting the stage for long-term prosperity.
As the example of export subsidies shows, the two models can co-exist happily in the world economy.
Liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists.
Indeed, that, in a nutshell, is the story of the last six decades: a succession of Asian countries managed to grow by leaps and bounds by applying different variants of mercantilism.
Governments in rich countries for the most part looked the other way while Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China protected their home markets, appropriated “intellectual property,” subsidized their producers, and managed their currencies.
We have now reached the end of this happy coexistence.
The liberal model has become severely tarnished, owing to the rise in inequality and the plight of the middle class in the West, together with the financial crisis that deregulation spawned.
Medium-term growth prospects for the American and European economies range from moderate to bleak.
Unemployment will remain a major headache and preoccupation for policymakers.
So mercantilist pressures will likely intensify in the advanced countries.
As a result, the new economic environment will produce more tension than accommodation between countries pursuing liberal and mercantilist paths.
It may also reignite long-dormant debates about the type of capitalism that produces the greatest prosperity.

Bipolar Markets in the “New Mediocre”
NEW YORK – Financial markets tend to undergo manic-depressive cycles, and this has been especially true in recent years.
During risk-ons, investors – driven by “animal spirits” – produce bull markets, frothiness, and sometimes outright bubbles; eventually, however, they overreact to some negative shock by becoming too pessimistic, shedding risk, and forcing a correction or bear market.
Whereas prices of US and global equities rose sharply throughout 2017, markets began to wobble in 2018, and became fully depressed in the last quarter of the year.
This risk-off reflected concerns about a global recession, Sino-American trade tensions, and the Federal Reserve’s signals that it would continue to raise interest rates and pursue quantitative tightening.
But since this past January, markets have rallied, so much so that some senior asset managers now foresee a market “melt-up” (the opposite of a meltdown), with equities continuing to rise sharply above their current elevated levels.
One could argue that this latest risk-on cycle will continue for the rest of the year.
For starters, growth is stabilizing in China, owing to another round of macroeconomic stimulus there, easing fears of a hard landing.
And the United States and China may soon reach a deal to prevent the ongoing trade war from escalating further.
At the same time, US and global growth are expected to strengthen somewhat in the second half of the year, and the disruption of a “hard Brexit” has been averted, with the European Union extending the deadline for the United Kingdom’s departure to October 31, 2019.
As for the eurozone’s prospects, much will depend on Germany, where growth could rebound as global headwinds fade.
Moreover, central banks, particularly the Fed, have become super-dovish again, and this appears to have reversed the tightening of financial conditions that produced the risk-off in late 2018.
And on the political front, the chances of impeachment proceedings in the US have fallen sharply with the release of the Mueller report, which clears US President Donald Trump of criminal conspiracy charges (though it is not dispositive on the question of obstruction of justice).
Now that the Russia investigation is over, Trump may avoid issuing destabilizing statements (or tweets) that could rattle the stock market, given that it is a key benchmark by which he judges his own success.
Finally, in a positive feedback loop, stronger markets boost economic growth, which in turn can lead to even higher market values.
These developments may or may not ensure clear sailing for the rest of the year.
While markets have already priced in the aforementioned positive potentialities, other factors could trigger another risk-off episode.
First, the price-to-earnings ratio is high in many markets, particularly for US equities, which means that even a modest negative shock could trigger a correction.
In fact, US corporate profit margins are so high that there could be an “earnings recession” this year if growth remains around 2%, while production costs may increase with a tight labor market.
Second, there are heightened risks associated with the scale and composition of US corporate-sector debt, owing to the prevalence of leveraged loans, high-yield junk bonds, and “fallen-angel” firms whose bonds have been downgraded from investment-grade to near-junk status.
Moreover, the commercial real-estate sector is burdened with overcapacity, as developers overbuilt and e-commerce sales have undercut demand for brick-and-mortar retail space.
Against this backdrop, any sign of a growth slowdown could lead to a sudden increase in the cost of capital for highly leveraged firms, not just in the US, but also in emerging markets, where a significant share of debt is denominated in dollars.
Third, assuming that US economic growth holds up, market expectations of more Fed dovishness will likely prove unfounded.
Thus, a Fed decision not to cut rates could come as a surprise, triggering an equity correction.
Fourth, hopes of a resolution to the Sino-American trade war may also be misplaced.
Even with a deal, the conflict could escalate again if either side suspects the other of not holding up its end.
And other simmering trade tensions could boil over, if, for example, the US Congress fails to ratify the Trump administration’s revised North American Free Trade Agreement, or if Trump follows through with import tariffs on cars from Europe.
Fifth, European growth is very fragile, and could be hindered by any of a number of developments, from a strong showing by populist parties in the upcoming European Parliament elections to a political or economic crisis in Italy.
This would come at a time when monetary and fiscal stimulus in the eurozone is constrained and eurozone integration is stalled.
Sixth, many emerging-market economies are also heavily exposed to political and policy risks. These include (from least to most fragile): Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Iran, and Venezuela.
And China’s latest round of stimulus has saddled its already indebted corporate sector with even more financial risk – and may not even suffice in lifting its growth rate.
Seventh, Trump may react to the Mueller report with bluster, not prudence.
With an eye to the 2020 presidential election, he could double down on his fights with the Democrats, launch new salvos in the trade war, stack the Fed Board with unqualified cronies, bully the Fed to cut rates, or precipitate another government shutdown over the debt ceiling or immigration policy.
At the same time, the Trump administration’s approach to Iran and Venezuela could put further upward pressure on oil prices – which have rallied since last fall – to the detriment of growth.
Finally, we are still in a world of low potential growth – a “New Mediocre” sustained by high private and public debt, rising inequality, and heightened geopolitical risk.
The widespread populist backlash against globalization, trade, migration, and technology will all but certainly have an eventual negative impact on growth and markets.
So, while investors’ latest love affair with equity markets may continue this year, it will remain a fickle and volatile relationship.
Any number of disappointments could trigger another risk-off and, possibly, a sharp market correction.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when.

National Governments, Global Citizens
CAMBRIDGE – Nothing endangers globalization more than the yawning governance gap – the dangerous disparity between the national scope of political accountability and the global nature of markets for goods, capital, and many services – that has opened up in recent decades.
When markets transcend national regulation, as with today’s globalization of finance, market failure, instability, and crisis is the result.
But pushing rule-making onto supranational bureaucracies, such as the World Trade Organization or the European Commission, can result in a democratic deficit and a loss of legitimacy.
How can this governance gap be closed?
One option is to re-establish national democratic control over global markets.
This is difficult and smacks of protectionism, but it is neither impossible nor necessarily inimical to healthy globalization.
As I argue in my book The Globalization Paradox, expanding the scope for national governments to maintain regulatory diversity and rebuild frayed social bargains would enhance the functioning of the global economy.
Instead, policy elites (and most economists) favor strengthening what is euphemistically called “global governance.”
According to this view, reforms such as those that enhance the effectiveness of the G-20, increase the representativeness of the International Monetary Fund’s Executive Board, and tighten the capital standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision would be sufficient to provide a sound institutional underpinning for the global economy.
But the trouble is not just that these global institutions remain weak.
It is also that they are inter-governmental bodies – a collection of member states rather than agents of global citizens.
Because their accountability to national electorates is indirect and uncertain, they do not generate the political allegiance – and hence legitimacy – that truly representative institutions require.
Indeed, the travails of the European Union have revealed the limits of transnational political community-building, even among a comparatively limited and similar set of countries.
Ultimately, the buck stops with national parliaments and executives.
During the financial crisis, it was national governments that bailed out banks and firms, recapitalized the financial system, guaranteed debts, eased liquidity, primed the fiscal pump, and paid the unemployment and welfare checks – and took the blame for everything that went wrong.
In the memorable words of outgoing Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, global banks are “international in life, but national in death.”
But perhaps there is another path, one that accepts the authority of national governments, but aims to reorient national interests in a more global direction.
Progress along such a path requires “national” citizens to begin viewing themselves increasingly as “global” citizens, with interests that extend beyond their state’s borders.
National governments are accountable to their citizens, at least in principle.
So, the more global these citizens’ sense of their interests becomes, the more globally responsible national policy will be.
This may seem like a pipedream, but something along these lines has already been happening for a while.
The global campaign for debt relief for poor countries was led by non-governmental organizations that successfully mobilized young people in rich countries to put pressure on their governments.
Multinational companies are well aware of the effectiveness of such citizen campaigns, having been compelled to increase transparency and change their ways on labor practices around the world.
Some governments have gone after foreign political leaders who committed human-rights crimes, with considerable domestic popular support.
Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development, cites the example of a Ghanaian citizen providing testimony to the US Congress in the hope of convincing American officials to pressure the World Bank to change its position on user fees in Africa.
Such bottom-up efforts to “globalize” national governments have the greatest potential to affect environmental policies, particularly those aimed at mitigating climate change – the most intractable global problem of all.
Interestingly, some of the most important initiatives to stem greenhouse gases and promote green growth are the products of local pressures.
World Resources Institute President Andrew Steer notes that more than 50 developing countries are now implementing costly policies to reduce climate change.
From the perspective of national interest, that makes no sense at all, given the global-commons nature of the problem.
Some of these policies are driven by the desire to attain a competitive advantage, as is the case with China’s support for green industries.
But when voters are globally aware and environmentally conscious, good climate policy can also be good politics.
Consider California, which at the beginning of this year launched a cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020.
While global action remained stalled on capping emissions, environmental groups and concerned citizens successfully pushed for the plan over the opposition of business groups, and the state’s Republican governor at the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger, signed it into law in 2006.
If it proves a success and remains popular, it could become a model for the entire country.
Global polls such as the World Values Survey indicate that there is still a lot of ground that needs to be covered: self-expressed global citizenship tends to run 15-20 percentage points behind national citizenship.
But the gap is smaller for young people, the better educated, and the professional classes.
Those who consider themselves to be at the top of the class structure are significantly more globally minded than those who consider themselves to be from the lower classes.
Of course, “global citizenship” will always be a metaphor, because there will never be a world government administering a worldwide political community.
But the more we each think of ourselves as global citizens and express our preferences as such to our governments, the less we will need to pursue the chimera of global governance.

Understanding the Frankenstein Tradition
PALO ALTO – “It’s alive, it’s moving, it’s alive... IT’S ALIVE!”
So said Dr. Victor Frankenstein when his “creation” was complete. Researchers have long been fascinated with trying to create life, but mainly they have had to settle for crafting variations of living organisms via mutation or other techniques of genetic engineering.amp#160;
In May, researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute, led by Venter himself, synthesized the genome of a bacterium from scratch using chemical building blocks, and inserted it into the cell of a different variety of bacteria.
The new genetic information “rebooted” its host cell and got it to function, replicate, and take on the characteristics of the “donor.”
In other words, a sort of synthetic organism had been created.
Reactions in the scientific community ranged from “slight novelty” to “looming apocalypse.”
The former is more apt: Venter’s creation is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
The goal of “synthetic biology,” as the field is known, is to move microbiology and cell biology closer to the approach of engineering, so that standardized parts can be mixed, matched, and assembled – just as off-the-shelf chassis, engines, transmissions, and so on can be combined to build a hot-rod.
Achieving this goal could offer scientists unprecedented opportunities for innovation, and better enable them to craft bespoke microorganisms and plants that produce pharmaceuticals, clean up toxic wastes, and obtain (or “fix”) nitrogen from the air (obviating the need for chemical fertilizers).
During the past half-century, genetic engineers, using increasingly powerful and precise tools and resources, have achieved breakthroughs that are opening up new opportunities in a broad array of fields.
The Venter lab’s achievement builds on similar work that began decades ago.amp#160; In 1967, a research group from Stanford Medical School and Caltech demonstrated the infectiousness of the genome of a bacterial virus called ΦΧ174, whose DNA had been synthesized with an enzyme using the intact viral DNA as a template, or blueprint.
That feat was hailed as “life in a test tube.”
In 2002, a research group at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, created a functional, infectious poliovirus solely from basic, off-the-shelf chemical building blocks.amp#160;Their only blueprint for engineering the genome was the known sequence of RNA (which comprises the viral genome and is chemically very similar to DNA).
Similar to the 1967 experiments, the infectious RNA was synthesized enzymatically.
It was able to direct the synthesis of viral proteins in the absence of a natural template.
Once again, scientists had, in effect, created life in a test tube.
Venter’s group did much the same thing in the recently reported research, except that they used chemical synthesis instead of enzymes to make the DNA.
But some of the hype that surrounded the publication of the ensuing article in the journal Nature was disproportionate.amp#160;
Along with the Venter paper, Nature published eight commentaries on the significance of the work.
The “real” scientists were aware of the incremental nature of the work, and questioned whether the Venter group had created a genuine “synthetic cell,” while the social scientists tended to exaggerate the implications of the work.
Mark Bedau, a professor of philosophy at Reed College, wrote that the technology’s “new powers create new responsibilities.
Nobody can be sure about the consequences of making new forms of life, and we must expect the unexpected and the unintended.
This calls for fundamental innovations in precautionary thinking and risk analysis.”
But, with increasing sophistication, genetic engineers using old and new techniques have been creating organisms with novel or enhanced properties for decades.
Regulations and standards of good practice already effectively address organisms that may be pathogenic or that threaten the natural environment.
(If anything, these standards are excessively burdensome.)
On the other hand, Swiss bioengineer Martin Fussenegger correctly observed that the Venter achievement “is a technical advance, not a conceptual one.”
Other scientists noted that the organism is really only “semi-synthetic,” because the synthetic DNA (which comprises only about 1% of the dry weight of the cell) was introduced into a normal, or non-synthetic, bacterium.
Understanding the history of synthetic biology is important, because recognizing the correct paradigm has critical implications for how governments regulate it, which in turn affects the potential application and diffusion of the technology.
Thirty-five years ago, the US National Institutes of Health adopted overly risk-averse guidelines for research using recombinant DNA, or “genetic engineering,” techniques.
Those guidelines, based on what has proved to be an idiosyncratic and largely invalid set of assumptions, sent a powerful message that scientists and the federal government were taking seriously speculative, exaggerated risk scenarios – a message that has afflicted the technology’s development worldwide ever since.
Synthetic biology offers the prospect of powerful new tools for research and development in innumerable fields.
But its potential can be fulfilled only if regulatory oversight is based on science, sound risk analysis, and an appreciation of the mistakes of history.

Japan's Delta Desperation
TOKYO – With the spread of the Delta variant, new COVID-19 infections are rising around the world, and much more so in regions and countries with low vaccination rates.
Japan is no exception.
Only around 40% of its population is fully vaccinated – compared to vaccination rates of 50-65% in the other G7 countries – and its infection rate has increased sharply over the past two months.
As of August 24, its seven-day rolling average of daily confirmed cases was 23,036, up from 3,000 only one month earlier.
Before the current surge, the highest seven-day average was around 6,500, reached in January and again in May of this year.
During those earlier surges, the Japanese government’s declaration of emergency and “requests” that people not go out had some effect.
But this time, the requests have been largely ignored.
The rising infection rate is bad news for a government that must soon face a general election.
But there are two bright spots.
First, the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games unfolded this summer without any major incidents, and with Japanese athletes winning 27 gold medals (the third-highest count after the United States and China).
A majority of Japanese now feel that it was good to have hosted the Games – a stark shift from pre-event polls.
Second, although Japan is trailing many other G7 and OECD countries in vaccinations, its vaccine rollout is nonetheless accelerating.
In the two months from June 19 to August 19, Japan’s share of fully vaccinated people rose from 8% to 40%, while the US rate rose only from 45% to 51%.
If current trends continue, Japan may overtake the US by late September.
And by late October, it will achieve a vaccination level comparable to New York State and major European countries, where masks are no longer required in many places.
Despite the recent progress, the Japanese government’s approval rating has sunk from 45% in March-April to below 30% today.
That is bad news for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, whose term as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) expires at the end of September, and whose four-year term in the House of Representatives ends on October 21.
Upon succeeding Shinzo Abe as prime minister last year, Suga initially had planned to call a snap election shortly after the end of the Paralympic Games on September 5, because an expected win in the general election would almost guarantee his own re-election as LDP leader.
But three factors have made that plan unworkable.
The first is the explosion of the Delta variant.
The number of prefectures under emergency or near-emergency declarations increased from 13 to 29 on August 20.
And although the government’s declaration for Tokyo and a few other areas is scheduled to end on September 12, it is unlikely that all the emergency declarations will be lifted on that day.
It would be considered inappropriate to call an election when many areas are still subject to emergency declarations, so Suga must first win the LDP leadership election, defeating competitors who have seized the opportunity offered by his low approval rating.
A second problem that is sinking the current government’s approval is that some infected people are reportedly dying at home because many of the beds reserved for COVID-19 patients are already full.
Worse, some hospitals have refused to admit more patients despite pleas from local government health coordinators.
These issues were laid bare this month by the widely reported, heart-breaking case of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 who was turned away from the hospital even after she had gone into premature labor.
Forced to deliver the baby at home, she called an ambulance, but it arrived too late, and her baby died.
This episode may linger in voters’ memories as a signal of policy failure.
Moreover, the number of people dying at home as a result of hospital incapacity will only continue to increase in the coming weeks.
The third factor weighing on Suga’s political prospects is the economy.
Recently released second-quarter figures suggest a weak recovery, with annualized growth reaching just 1.3%.
Japan’s real (inflation-adjusted) GDP remains at 97% of its pre-pandemic peak in the third quarter of 2019.
By contrast, second-quarter GDP in the US was already 1% higher than its pre-pandemic peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The government has offered essentially no policy response to deal with the Delta wave or the country’s continuing economic woes.
All it can point to is an emergency declaration that imposes only soft restraints, such as the request that restaurants not serve alcohol and close their doors at 8 p.m.
Japan must learn from New York, where public authorities last year ordered a suspension of all indoor dining, while allowing restaurants to remain open for take-out customers.
Large offices were closed, and schools and universities shifted to remote teaching.
If people went out, it was only for reasons like grocery shopping or to see a doctor.
When there was a shortage of hospital beds, the New York State government converted the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a field hospital.
At least one hospital also erected tents in Central Park for additional beds.
Given the latest surge of infections, Suga should be pressing for the temporary closure of all restaurants and shops.
If necessary, the law should be changed to empower the government to impose a “city lockdown,” shuttering restaurants, shops, offices, and large-scale events in urban areas.
And even if these measures prove infeasible, many more resources should be given to hospitals on the condition that they accept COVID-19 patients when requested.
Unless Suga acts quickly, more lives will be lost, and his own political position may become yet another victim of the virus.

America’s Anti-Environmentalists
As an American, I am appalled, ashamed, and embarrassed by my country’s lack of leadership in dealing with global warming.
Scientific evidence on the risks mounts by the day, as most recently documented in England’s magisterial Stern Report.
Yet, despite the fact that the United States accounts for roughly 25% of all man-made global carbon emissions, Americans show little will or inclination to temper their manic consumption.
The first George W. Bush administration was probably right to refuse to sign the so-called “Kyoto Protocol,” albeit for the wrong reasons.
Among other problems, the Kyoto Protocol does not go far enough towards redistributing carbon emission rights towards developing countries.
But why can’t the US bring itself to raise taxes on gasoline and other sources of carbon emission like coal burning power plants?
It is not like the US government, running a huge deficit despite an economic boom, does not need the money.
Many people seem to think that the Bush administration is the problem.
Put a Texas oilman and his buddies in charge and what do you expect, conservation?
Unfortunately, that is a facile excuse.
American citizens’ resistance to moderating energy consumption for the sake of the global environment is much more deeply embedded.
Consider former US Vice President Al Gore, for example, whose documentary film on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth, is celebrated for its unflinching look at how fossil fuel consumption is leading mankind to the brink of catastrophe.
The evidence on global warming is considerably more muddled than Gore’s film suggests, but the basic problem is real.
Unfortunately, however, Gore was not successful in carrying the torch on global warming when he was a politician.
One cannot commend the 1990’s Clinton-Gore administration for taking any brave steps aimed at radically reducing carbon emissions.
Small wonder: the American public is fiercely resistant to anything that seriously forces them to compromise on their energy-burning, gas-guzzling lifestyle.
It is not just politicians who have failed to provide leadership here.
The venerable New York Times editorial page was apparently opposed to an energy tax until only recently, when the newspaper finally endorsed the idea.
Like many liberals, the Times’ editors worried that higher energy taxes would fall disproportionately on the poor.
The typical argument one hears is, “What about the poor guy with the gas-guzzling 1980 Chevy car, who has no other way to get to work?” It is a legitimate point, but if ocean levels start rising, as the Stern Report predicts, a lot of our children will be swimming to work some day.
The need for corrective measures to alleviate inequality is no excuse for inaction on global warming.
The change of position by the Times, unfortunately, does not herald an about-face in the American electorate.
Mention the idea of an energy tax to any potential 2008 US Presidential candidate, and their faces will pale.
It is fine to say that you care about the environment or to claim, as Bush seems to do, that miracle technologies will solve the problem without too much pain.
But any 2008 Presidential candidate that dares to talk about making sacrifices now for a safer environment later will really be sticking his neck out.
Until Americans suck it up and start fixing global environmental problems that they, more than anyone, have caused, it will be difficult to get the wholehearted support of the rest of the world.
Developing countries ask why they should pay attention to global warming if rich countries are not prepared to curtail their own emissions sharply?
Why should poor countries worry about how deforestation contributes to global warming when rich countries remain so profligate?
The scientific evidence suggests that carbon emissions from anywhere in the world have about the same impact on global warming.
For this reason, a wide range of economists favor a uniform (“harmonized”) global tax that would tax carbon emissions equally everywhere in the world, and from whatever source – whether coal, oil, or gas, and whether consumers or businesses.
Such a tax is the most flexible and market-friendly approach, and would have the least impact on economic growth.
Instead, the complex system of quotas favored by the Europeans and embodied in the Kyoto Protocol is likely to lead to much larger inefficiencies and costs.
For this reason, England’s Stern Report is probably far too optimistic when it calculates that an eclectic approach to reducing carbon emissions will cost the world only 1% per year of income.
But the Stern Report is still right to argue that the potential risks of continued inaction are far greater.
America’s unwillingness to take the lead on environmental issues may some day be regarded as one of the country’s most profound political failures.
One hopes that it changes course soon, before we all are forced to wear swimsuits to work.

The EU Must Terminate Hungary's Membership
BOSTON – Following Hungary’s adoption of legislation banning “LGBTQ content” in schools this past June, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte concluded that the country “has no place in the EU anymore.”
He’s right.
The European Union should begin the process of expelling Hungary, and it should then consider doing the same with Poland.
Over the past decade, Hungary and Poland have consistently undermined the rule of law and democratic institutions, which are supposed to be at the core of the European project.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s self-styled “illiberal democracy” is a misnomer: there is no longer any democracy to speak of.
Courts are increasingly under the control of Orbán’s Fidesz party; the media have little freedom left; civil-society organizations operate under constant threat; and universities have already been stripped of what little autonomy they had.
In Poland, meanwhile, the similarly authoritarian ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), has openly followed in Orbán’s footsteps.
Though it has not yet cowed civil society and the opposition to the same degree, it is steadily undermining the country’s democratic institutions.
From the EU’s perspective, the two countries’ refusals to participate in a new European Public Prosecutor’s Office should be the last straw.
Launched in June, the EPPO has a mandate to investigate and prosecute fraud, embezzlement, and other crimes involving EU funds.
Not surprisingly, there is ample evidence implicating both Fidesz and PiS in such abuses.
By refusing to recognize the EPPO’s authority even as they continue to receive EU funds, Hungary and Poland are making a mockery of the European project and everything it stands for.
Moreover, there is now yet another argument for the EU to act against Hungary and Poland.
With the Taliban’s reconquest of Afghanistan, there is no longer any doubt that the Western effort to establish democracy and the rule of law by force and foreign aid has failed.
From now on, Western countries will have to lead by example.
As US President Jimmy Carter said in his inaugural address: “The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.”
In new research examining data from more than 110 countries, Nicolás Ajzenman, Cevat Giray Aksoy, Martin Fiszbein, Carlos Molina, and I show that democratic institutions generate greater trust when they reliably deliver economic growth, peace, stability, and public services.
Evidence from the past four decades suggests that democratization proceeds in regional waves, partly because the demand for democracy spreads from one country to another.
Reversals of democracy have followed a similar pattern.
When existing democracies appear less worthy of emulation, democratic institutions are less likely to spread.
These considerations apply doubly to the EU, given that its mission is to establish democratic institutions at the supranational level.
At a time when global cooperation is needed more than ever, the EU’s historic experiment should be viewed as a success.
At the end of World War II, the continent was devastated and hollowed out economically, having poured all of its resources into armaments.
While the United States was awash in modern technologies such as refrigerators, central heating, indoor plumbing, and civilian transport systems, these were nowhere to be seen in Europe.
In Britain, which had fared better than the rest of the continent, only half the houses in 1947 had hot water or indoor plumbing.
In Germany, many major cities – including Hamburg, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dresden, and Berlin – laid in ruins after Allied bombing raids.
As many as 20 million Germans were homeless, and 10% of the country’s prewar population was dead.
The rest of Europe was hardly much better. Occupied France, Belgium, and the Netherlands faced long recoveries after being savagely pillaged by the Nazis.
On top of it all, historic animosities – especially against Germany – were at an all-time high.
Many assumed that communism or conservative dictatorships were more likely than democracy to take hold.
Peace was viewed as tenuous at best.
But, as we now know, peace prevailed and democracy took root and blossomed in all of Western Europe, except Spain and Portugal (which remained under their own quasi-fascist dictatorships until later decades).
Economically, the situation improved almost unbelievably; the three decades following the war came to be known as les trente glorieuses – the glorious 30 years.
More recently, the EU’s expansion to Central and Eastern Europe was initially a success, too.
It is difficult to imagine that Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Baltic countries could have undergone so rapid a democratic transition without the prospect of EU accession and funding.
And it is equally unlikely that Poland would have emerged as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies without the EU.
But the eastward expansion now looks like Europe’s Achilles’ heel.
Hungary and Poland have come to symbolize the EU’s dysfunction and institutional weaknesses.
To be sure, expelling Hungary, and credibly threatening Poland with the same fate, is a serious decision that should not be made hastily.
Any member state can elect a government that might try to weaken democratic institutions (as Italy did with Silvio Berlusconi, and as Britain has done with Boris Johnson).
Generally, the best way to deal with would-be authoritarians is to allow democratic institutions to do their jobs and trust voters to remove dangerous politicians.
But Hungary has become the exception that nullifies the rule. After more than a decade under Orbán’s Fidesz Party, its democracy appears to have been fatally wounded, raising doubts that voters could ever remove the current regime.
The longer the EU continues to treat Hungary like a normal democracy, the more damage it will do to its own brand.
It should start the process of changing its rules, so that it can take action against Hungary and Poland, even if these countries try to use their veto power.
It should then invoke Article Seven of the Treaty on European Union to suspend Hungary’s voting rights, and then stop the delivery of EU funds to the country while it works out the best way of terminating its membership.
Barring some miraculous last-moment return to democracy, Hungary must go in order for the European project to survive.

Greenspan Hypnotizes Himself
On the eve of the last G-7 meeting in London, US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did a startling about-face by soft-pedaling America’s trade deficit. “Market pressures …appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the US current-account deficit and its attendant financing requirements,” he said.
But just two months earlier, in Frankfurt, Mr. Greenspan had cautioned that the US deficit could not go on forever without the dollar depreciating. What is going on here?
To be sure, the US trade figures have improved somewhat.
The expected December trade deficit is $57 billion—an improvement on the record $60.3 billion gap in November.
And the November figure will be adjusted downward because of a recently discovered statistical error by Canadian authorities.
But politics, not economics, explains why the Fed chairman changed his tune about America’s weak external position. Mr. Greenspan’s statement in Frankfurt in November alarmed senior European Central Bank (ECB) officials, who considered it a “provocation” – one that promptly sent the dollar into an unwanted tailspin.
The last thing the Fed Maestro needed was a repeat performance on the eve of the G-7 – a meeting that is supposed to exemplify international co-operation.
So Mr. Greenspan decided to extend a peace offering to the Europeans.
Politics also explains Mr. Greenspan’s pre-G-7 comment that “the voice of fiscal restraint, barely audible a year ago, has at least partially regained volume.”
The Fed chairman is “hearing voices” because he is a team player who wants to encourage US budget cutting.
How would it look if he had openly expressed misgivings about Bush’s plan to cut the budget deficit in half by 2009 just days before it was made public?
What Mr. Greenspan chose to overlook, however, is that most experts are extremely – and rightly – skeptical of the Bush plan, which leaves out big-ticket items such as the cost of the Iraq War, and uses an unrealistic benchmark from which to measure the alleged 50% cutback.
Timing the budget’s release for just after the G-7 made for a harmonious London meeting in which both Americans and Europeans could claim that the US was taking care of business—that is, its twin fiscal and current-account deficits.
The Europeans gladly went along with this charade because they now fear dollar depreciation more than global imbalance.
So far, Europe’s fragile economic recovery has been based largely on exports.
The euro’s rapid appreciation against the dollar threatens to undermine this foundation.
But internal European Union studies indicate that European exports are more closely linked to changes in external demand than the euro-dollar exchange rate.
So long as external demand holds up – and recent growth numbers from China and the US are positive in this regard – Europe’s exports should continue to perform well.
In any case, protecting exports by resisting euro appreciation – or, more precisely, dollar depreciation – is a poor way to promote economic growth.
A strong currency keeps both inflation and ECB interest hikes at bay.
This helps boost private consumption and investment.
Moreover, because crude oil is priced in US dollars, a rise in the euro means a fall in energy costs.
This, too, helps European growth.
Over the longer term, a strong currency promotes efficiency in export industries, further insulating competitiveness from exchange-rate effects.
Dollar depreciation improves Europe’s terms of trade and real income.
America’s fiscal and external deficits will not disappear just because the chief magician at the Federal Reserve waves his wand and says abracadabra.
On the contrary, the longer Greenspan plays down America’s dangerous macroeconomic imbalances with happy talk, the more damage they will ultimately inflict on the global economy.
What the world needs now is the realist Greenspan of Frankfurt, not the cheerleader Greenspan of London.
Simply put, there must be dollar depreciation to keep global imbalances in check.
Instead of catering to European fears and prejudices about exchange rates, the Fed chairman should put politics aside and stick to sound economics.

The US with Iran in Syria
PRINCETON – The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama’s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile.
The eleventh-hour U-turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in Syria.
And that outcome is not possible without Iran.
In a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart, Walid al-Moallem, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tabled a proposal, originally agreed with Iran, calling for Syria to “place chemical weapons storage sites under international control.” The stockpiles would then be destroyed and Syria would fully join the international Chemical Weapons Convention.
The second component of the Russian-Iranian proposal calls for international efforts, under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council, to rein in Syrian rebel forces’ chemical-weapons capabilities.
Moallem immediately embraced the proposal.
Hours later, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did as well, while Obama said that “I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way.”
This initiative would allow Obama to escape from a messy political and foreign-policy predicament.
But the matter is far from settled: Obama has not ruled out a military strike.
So here are 12 reasons why America should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the Russian-Iranian plan.
First, there is evidence that the Syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons.
In December 2012, Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons, including sarin gas, being transferred to Syria.
The US declined to cooperate with Iran to press ahead on the case.
Second, US military strikes on Syria have the potential to engulf the entire region – and perhaps the US – in a broader war.
After its experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, the US can hardly afford a Syrian quagmire.
Third, with the regional Sunni-Shia conflict intensifying, the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region.
US military strikes against Syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against Syrians of all faiths.
Reports point to the execution and mutilation of Syrian-government prisoners.
There is no doubt that the fate of Syria’s Christian and Jewish communities is now extremely precarious.
Fourth, America’s decision to back extremists in Syria contradicts its “war on terrorism” and will erode international support for it.
The prospect of Iranian cooperation to root out Al Qaeda extremists, which it provided in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be unlikely following any intervention.
Fifth, it is wrong to assume that without Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran would lose its influence in the Muslim world as well as its link to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
America’s regional position weakened, and Iran’s strengthened, following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq; US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern.
Sixth, a US attack on Syria would leave the US isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution.
There is no domestic or international appetite for another US military adventure – NATO, the G-20, the Europeans, Russia, China, and 60% of Americans oppose a unilateral US military strike.
Seventh, the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high.
If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good.
Eighth, US involvement in Syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the US and Iran.
Al Qaeda affiliates will target US regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on Iran and its militant proxies – providing a pretext for US military confrontation.
Ninth, a US military strike against a third Muslim-majority country would demolish the credibility of Obama’s efforts to repair America’s image in the Islamic world.
Indeed, it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the “resistance axis” – Iran and Hezbollah.
Tenth, any US unilateral military strike against Syria would ratchet up tensions between the US and Russia.
This, in turn, would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance.
Eleventh, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani’s new administration to enter into direct talks with the US.
No better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along.
In these circumstances, a US attack on Syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a US-Iran rapprochement for years to come.
Finally, with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President, a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face-saving solution (for both sides) on Iran’s nuclear program.
Both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime.
Indeed, Iran was a major victim of chemical-weapons attacks during its 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.
Iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of WMDs in Syria, the Middle East, and beyond.
Iran maintains that the Security Council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response.
One promising avenue for US-Iran cooperation on Syria could be joint support for a fact-finding mission by the Security Council to identify the perpetrators.
Obama has his “red line” on the use of chemical weapons.
So does Khamenei.

Planning the Route to Net Zero
LONDON – The travel details of the huge number of world leaders, company CEOs, and investors who made their way to Glasgow for the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) may seem trivial.
The carbon footprint of their transport of choice – plane, car, or train – or the size of their entourage pales in importance when compared to that of the agreements they hope to achieve.
But the reality is that without careful planning of the journey, it would have been impossible to bring these people together for this essential event.
The same can be said of the explosion of interest by investors and companies in committing to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.
The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero initiative, launched in April, now represents over 450 financial firms responsible for assets of roughly $130 trillion that are committed to achieving net zero by 2050 or sooner.
These promises are significant, but they leave financial markets in an interesting position.
There is considerable information about companies’ long-term climate goals, but very little about the near-term steps they will take to achieve them.
To put this in context, imagine that a company publishes a 2050 revenue forecast but provides few details about its 2025 revenue projections, how the business will scale over time, or its short-term strategy.
In order to appraise the credibility of companies’ pledges, investors need more details on near-term planning up to 2025 and how these actions will advance the 2050 net-zero goal.
The emphasis on 2025 reflects that year’s potential to mark a tipping point for the net-zero transition.
S&P Global’s Platts Future Energy Outlooks indicates that the world must move faster to curb emissions and show concrete progress by that year or risk overshooting a 2° Celsius rise in average global temperatures, relative to preindustrial levels.
To avoid this outcome, almost all economic sectors – from heavy industry to transport – would need to reduce total annual emissions to below 2019 levels by 2025, and supplies from wind and solar would need to increase 133% and 98%, respectively, from 2019 levels.
As with any significant transition, a balance of risk and opportunity is at play in the green economic transition, and demand for comparable and consistent scenario analysis continues to rise as companies seek to unlock capital and investors seek to align their portfolio strategies with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
With the world’s assets under management increasingly committed to the net-zero goal, and active engagement by investors supplanting passive stewardship, successful companies will be those that share detailed plans for this transition.
This represents a real opportunity for progressive companies to access capital directly from institutional investors and through increasingly popular environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or sustainability-focused indices.
(Assets in European sustainability-focused passive funds trebled in 2020.)
The opportunities for investors in companies engaged in the green transition are clear.
What about the risks?
ESG factors can and do influence credit quality, specifically the ability and willingness of borrowers to meet financial commitments.
These criteria played a prominent role in creditworthiness – and therefore in S&P Global credit ratings – well before they were grouped together and became a composite indicator more than a decade ago.
At times, ESG considerations will affect an entire industry’s prospects.
This year, S&P Global Ratings updated its risk assessment for the oil and gas industry to incorporate several increasingly material risks, including the energy transition.
Such risks will be increasingly salient.
In August, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the publication of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report a “code red for humanity.”
What does this mean for companies and investors?
According to data from S&P Global Trucost, physical assets owned by the utilities, materials, energy, consumer staples, and health-care sectors will face the greatest climate-related risks in 2050, with 66% of the market cap of the S&P 1200 holding assets at high risk.
Water stress will be the biggest climate-related hazard to assets by 2050, especially for the utilities and materials sectors.
And corporate infrastructure in Asia, East Asia, the Middle East, and North America is most exposed to severe weather events and other adverse effects of climate change.
The sense of urgency is clear, and both businesses and investors will increasingly need access to high-quality data and advanced analytics to understand and address climate-related risks and develop credible adaptation plans.
Significant progress has been made in the last 12 months, but to achieve net zero by 2050, a clearer focus on near-term planning and more transparency about strategy is required.
For the moment, the destination has been set, but the route to get there is still being defined.
Companies should be applauded for setting ambitious climate goals, but, like the leaders planning their journeys to Glasgow, now they must show how they will get there.

Is Trump Right About Middle-East Peace?
PARIS – By withdrawing American troops from northern Syria, US President Donald Trump has once again signaled that his administration recognizes only two national interests in the Middle East: containment of Iran and Israel’s security.
Regarding the former, the United States recently sent more troops to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main regional adversary.
As for the latter, Trump has repeatedly said that he will present a plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Because such an initiative could become a factor in the 2020 US presidential election campaign, Trump will have to decide soon whether to fulfill this commitment once a new Israeli government takes office following the country’s parliamentary election last month.
Trump has tasked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, with developing a detailed peace plan.
While that represents a departure from previous US diplomatic efforts, which had always aimed to lead Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate a peace treaty between themselves under American auspices, this new approach is not necessarily a bad idea, because both sides seem incapable of moving forward on their own.
The Palestinian Authority – disavowed at the ballot box in Gaza in 2006, run by aging leaders, and undermined by corruption – has lost the legitimacy that it would need to make concessions.
Israel, meanwhile, has drifted so far to the right that no government could propose to the Knesset a peace plan acceptable to both sides.
An arbitrator could, in theory, overcome these obstacles.
Moreover, Kushner’s close ties to Israel may paradoxically be a further asset.
History shows that winners of geopolitical confrontations almost never voluntarily give up the fruits of their victory.
Israel, a regional superpower with a post-industrial economy, nuclear weapons, and an unwavering alliance with the US, clearly has the means to impose its will on a weak Palestinian adversary.
No Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement could fail to reflect this power imbalance.
Moreover, no external party, whether the major European powers or even Arab governments, will affect that balance: the Europeans are divided on the subject, and the Arab Gulf states have largely become de facto allies of Israel against Iran.
Israel therefore holds the key to resolving the conflict.
But that means persuading the Israeli public to accept the establishment of a foreign country, possibly an enemy, just 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from its capital.
These considerations help to explain the Trump administration’s numerous recent favors to Israel, including the transfer of the US embassy in the country from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and US recognition of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights.
Kushner’s goal is to show the Israelis that they can trust Trump when he puts peace proposals on the table.
To the extent that Trump is now more popular in Israel than Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the US approach has clearly worked.
Kushner’s plan is now ready.
It is 50 pages long, he told me a few months ago.
Although the plan’s contents are a well-kept secret, they are likely to be close to Israel’s position.
The US proposal might therefore offer the Palestinians a large degree of autonomy rather than a full-fledged state, and maintain most of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Is the Kushner plan therefore doomed to fail?
That is arguably the safest bet, given the inability of previous US presidents to bring peace to the region over the last 20 years.
But we must not rule anything out.
In June, the Trump administration put forward a separate proposal for massive economic aid to the West Bank and Gaza, including some $50 billion in investments over ten years.
Such a package may well appeal to people in dire economic need.
Moreover, it is “five to midnight” in the West Bank: the continued expansion of Israeli settlements will soon render impossible the territorial compromise necessary to establish a viable Palestinian state.
The Palestinians therefore face a choice between an unsatisfactory compromise and a continuous (and soon irreversible) deterioration of their situation.
Perhaps they will conclude that taking a deal will be a good first step.
That, at least, is the calculation of Kushner, who repeatedly says that his plan will be “better for the Palestinians than they think.”
At the same time, both sides would be relieved not to have to answer to US pressure.
The Palestinians fear having a quasi-Israeli diktat imposed on them.
And Israel knows that Trump, who has a purely transactional view of diplomacy, expects it to repay his generosity by making concessions toward a peace deal.
Above all, the status quo favors Israel, which can keep the West Bank without having to decide whether to make Palestinians Israeli citizens or foreigners on their own land.
Moreover, Israel may conclude that its overwhelming regional military superiority ensures its security at least as well as any peace agreement would – if not better.
Everything now depends on Trump, who has publicly promised to transmit his son-in-law’s peace plan to both parties.
But whatever Trump decides, and whoever wins the 2020 US presidential election, one thing is clear: Israel and the Palestinians are unable to reach a peace agreement by themselves, as even Israel’s most ardent US supporters now acknowledge.
Any subsequent attempt to mediate the conflict will have to be based on recognition of that reality.
Like US presidents before him, Trump may well fail to secure an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
But by proposing an agreement instead of merely trying to broker one between the two sides, he could yet establish a model for his successors to follow.

Geneva on the Rhine
PARIS – Twenty years ago, in the immediate aftermath of Germany’s reunification, French magazines were full of caricatures of Chancellor Helmut Kohl wearing the traditional pointed Prussian helmet.
The new Germany was perceived as a threat to the European balance.
Germany was simply “too much” again.
German geopolitical ambitions, it was believed, would invariably seek greater proportionality with the size of the country’s population and the dynamism of its economy.
It was only a matter of time, people thought, before the “German Question” would return to haunt Europe, as it did between 1871 and 1945.
To a large extent, Helmut Kohl held up the same picture, which he used to persuade his European counterparts that they should rush to bind Germany to a more integrated Europe.
Indeed, this reasoning led to the creation of the euro.
For the sake of its European vocation, Germany proclaimed itself ready to abandon its cherished deutschmark, the currency that had accompanied and symbolized its spectacular economic rebirth and post-war social stability.
Today, it is not an excess of German ambition, but rather a lack of it, that is threatening Europe.
Germany may remain “too big” for other Europeans, but the “new German problem” is that the country wants too little.
Its dream is neither to dominate Europe, nor even to lead it by the exemplary quality of its policies.
Germany’s not-so-secret ambition is to become a Magna Helvetia, a Big Switzerland – prosperous, stable, neutral, and ultimately irrelevant.
Such a dream is obviously flawed.
Switzerland can be Switzerland because it is surrounded by the peaceful environment of the European Union.
It is one thing for smaller European countries to dream of being Swiss; it is quite another when such an aspiration comes from the heart of Europe, from the country that was once seen as the EU’s keenest pupil.
So, what went wrong?
The rise of euro-skepticism in Germany is a new twist in the country’s ongoing “normalization.”
With the rise of political leaders who had not witnessed the terrifying consequences of WWII, it was inevitable that Germany’s emotional bond with its European mission – born of guilt and the quest for redemption – should gradually disappear.
Before dreaming of Magna Helvetia, Germany briefly passed through a phase in which it saw itself as a “second France” – a country dominated by the pursuit of national interest, with Europe the continuation of that pursuit by other means.
But soon Switzerland became a reference point for German leaders, and then an explicit and dangerous model.
Referenda are not for Germany what they are in Switzerland, a normal mode of governance.
But, on all major issues, and not only because of their political weakness, Germany’s leaders now make public opinion the polestar of policy.
This drift towards populism exists everywhere in Europe nowadays, but it is particularly damaging when it affects Europe’s leading country.
German public opinion is not necessarily wrong when it denounces the irresponsible behavior that led Greece into its present crisis.
Nor, after Japan’s Fukushima disaster, are Germans irresponsible to reject nuclear power – which is unlike all other energy sources and represents a risk of a far mightier magnitude – with renewed vigor.
And it is not necessarily unwise to express doubts about the rationality of engaging wholeheartedly in Libya without being fully aware of the strength of either Muammar Qaddafi’s loyalists or the rebels, even if Germany’s resulting policy was formulated in a rather naïve and unprofessional manner.
The problem is that policies that reflect a quasi-automatic response to the momentary Diktat of German public opinion do not represent a coherent whole.
The famous saying in Renaissance France, “What woman desires, God wants,” has become, “What the people desire, politicians will deliver.”
Nowhere is this trend from pedagogical responsibility towards demagogic populism more worrisome than in Germany.
Europe’s most populous country and largest economy cannot base its policies solely on its public opinion without causing further damage to the performance of the EU as a whole.
Germany has never been more powerful in Europe than it is today – and it has never been less ambitious for Europe.
And yet Europe cannot succeed without Germany remaining deeply European.
The problem goes beyond Germany’s current leadership, though its increasing weakness certainly does not help.
Germany’s path largely reflects a structural evolution that marks the way Germans now look at Europe.
Yesterday, Europe was the solution for Germany; today, it is the problem.
Yesterday, Europe guaranteed that Germany would never again go astray; today, it is the impediment that threatens the country’s hard-won financial and economic stability.
Europe’s main challenge today is to keep the European flame alive in Germany.
The more distant and neutral to the European project Germany becomes, the more its partners, especially France, must behave like engaged and responsible Europeans.
It may not be enough, but without this nothing can be achieved.
Or, following the German lead, will a Europe-wide Magna Helvetia become the last European ambition?

The Makings of a “Geopolitical” European Commission
BERLIN – On December 1, Ursula von der Leyen will finally take office as president of the European Commission.
She has promised to lead a commission that will avoid a scenario in which, as French President Emmanuel Macron recently warned, Europe might “disappear geopolitically” amid an escalating Sino-American rivalry.
To be sure, the European Union has the largest market in the world, the second-highest defense spending (after the United States), 55,000 diplomats, and the world’s largest development-assistance budget.
But these strengths are constrained by the fragmentation of European power both between and within member states and EU institutions.
While China and the US are both adept at integrating geopolitics with their economic interests, the EU stubbornly acts as if these were separate agendas.
If von der Leyen is to succeed in building an effective “geopolitical commission,” she will need to pass seven big tests. The first will be to build unity behind her proposed European Green Deal, which she has made one of her central priorities.
The question is not just whether she can direct an effective European response to climate change, but whether she can prevent the issue from becoming another front in the culture war between the EU’s western member states and the cohort in Central and Eastern Europe.
Voters in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia are ambivalent about whether climate change needs to be addressed at all.
If von der Leyen’s Commission does not take steps to bring these populations on board, the European Green Deal could reprise the politics of the euro and refugee crises, when marginal EU constituencies felt neglected by more powerful actors in the EU core (many of whom were clearly convinced of their own moral superiority).
Second, von der Leyen’s Commission will have to be open to potential counter-measures against America’s weaponization of the dollar.
Since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, his administration has effectively been deciding with whom Europeans may trade, by threatening secondary sanctions against any company that does business with Iran.
The challenge for a geopolitical commission, then, is to identify areas where US companies are asymmetrically dependent on Europe, and where European sanctions (or the mere threat of sanctions) could be deployed to maximum effect.
This strategy has already proved effective in the standoff over auto tariffs.
Third, von der Leyen’s Commission will have to take up the issue of European defense.
There are three discernible camps. The first includes the French, who want to achieve European strategic autonomy and end the bloc’s dependence on the US.
The second camp, epitomized by Poland, favors “strategic servitude,” and wants to double down on the transatlantic relationship by purchasing more US equipment and establishing “Fort Trumps” to keep the US engaged on the continent.
The third, represented by Germany, advocates “strategic patience,” based on the hope that Trump’s eventual departure will allow for a return to normality.
The only way to reconcile these views is to strengthen Europe’s contributions to NATO, so that it is seen as a better partner to the US.
Fourth, von der Leyen’s Commission must reconsider the EU’s competition policy, which currently focuses only on state aid and other unfair practices within Europe, while ignoring unfair competition from abroad.
Fifth, and on a related note, the new Commission will need to develop a screening mechanism for foreign investments that both protects sensitive sectors and compensates EU member states that are asked to turn down foreign capital.
In addition to establishing common screening procedures, the EU should empower the Commission to veto foreign investments on security grounds, with the European Council retaining the final say (through qualified majority voting).
Sixth, von der Leyen’s Commission will need to develop a European cyber defense agency worthy of the name.
Specifically, the EU’s new leaders should transform ENISA (the EU Agency for Cybersecurity) into a well-staffed and well-financed institution with centralized computer emergency response teams (CERTs), cyber forensic squads, and legislative representatives to push for stronger security protocols across the bloc.
Finally, von der Leyen will be tasked with repositioning the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as credible counterweights to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
So far, the EU has not taken a strategic approach to reshaping the global financial architecture, and its response to China’s global investment and development activities has been timid at best.
Giving the EIB and the EBRD a global remit to fund projects outside of Europe would help to reverse this failure.
Moreover, it would allow Europe to bail out countries facing fiscal or financial crises in the event that the US or China tie the hands of the International Monetary Fund or other institutions.
Each of these seven tests is in an area where the EU could potentially become a key global player, capable of holding its own with other great powers.
But each challenge will require genuine unity among Europeans, with EU institutions and member-state governments working together seamlessly.
Rather than dealing with these issues in a piecemeal fashion, von der Leyen should pursue a grand bargain that gives real meaning and shape to the next five years of EU policymaking.
Among other things, that will require creative thinking about the next seven-year budget framework, which should be used to marshal the resources that Europe needs to establish itself as a global player, and to advance innovative measures like green bonds, digital taxation, and carbon pricing.
Only then will “geopolitical commission” be a turning point, not a sound bite.

How Dr. Strangelove Learned to Love Trump
PARIS – At first glance, former United States National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and President-elect Donald Trump would seem to have nothing in common.
In one corner stands the experienced, sophisticated grand old man of US diplomacy; in the other hulks the crude, braying archetypal man of Twitter.
And yet, in a recent appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation, Kissinger lavished praise on Trump, calling him a “phenomenon.” That is an intriguing word choice: a “phenomenon” usually describes a savant, artist, world-class athlete, or rock star.
Sixty years ago, the young Kissinger was keen on introducing the US to Europe’s complex history and arcane style of diplomacy.
He wanted American leaders to resemble such sophisticates as Klemens von Metternich and Otto von Bismarck.
But, as the Nobel laureate Bob Dylan famously put it, “The times, they are a-changin’,” and today Kissinger wants to explain Trump’s uniquely “American style” to the world – a reversal that may reflect his disappointment at having failed in his original venture.
Substantively, Kissinger’s message to his sophisticated European and Asian colleagues seems to be, “Don’t panic.” Trump may look and sound strange, Kissinger might say, but he is quintessentially American, and America today needs to overhaul its relations with the world.
By this reasoning, Trump’s unorthodox approach might be just what America – and the world – needs.
A Kissinger-Trump alliance certainly seems unnatural, but it is worth remembering that their relationship is not new.
During the Republican primary, Kissinger refused to join a group of Republican foreign-policy mandarins who signed an open letter denouncing Trump as a dangerous amateur and usurper.
During the campaign, the question on many people’s minds was, “How could voters give such an unpredictable and inexperienced person control of the nuclear codes?” Kissinger’s silence on this question was deafening, especially given that he was one of the inspirations for Stanley Kubrick’s classic political satire Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
One explanation for the two men’s unnatural alliance is that they have compatible views on Russian President Vladimir Putin, even if their larger foreign-policy outlooks differ.
Whereas Trump admires Putin’s muscular nationalism and authoritarian decisiveness, Kissinger has long believed that there is no better alternative for Russia.
Beyond this, a more straightforward explanation is that Trump has played on Kissinger’s vanity, not least by seeking his advice early in the campaign.
To be sure, Kissinger may be more sagacious than his fellow elites in claiming that there is more to Trump than meets the eye.
But it is just as likely that, at 93, Kissinger is simply more susceptible than ever to flattery.
By asking for his advice, Trump is intimating to Kissinger that he considers him a man of the present, not the past.
And Kissinger, for his part, may be hoping for a future role in the new administration, such as a “special envoy” responsible for resetting relations with Russia or even China.
Of course, this is a marriage of convenience.
Trump desperately needs to boost his gravitas, and Kissinger can offer that in spades.
A reassuring foreign-policy mantra for the president-elect would be, “Don’t worry, I’ve got Kissinger behind me.”
But, an alliance with Trump would carry risks for Kissinger, whose defense of the president-elect might further tarnish his image in the US and around the world.
Almost a half-century later, many people have not forgotten that Kissinger was behind such dark episodes as the 1969-70 “secret” bombing of Cambodia, which set the stage for the Khmer Rouge’s genocidal rule there, and the overthrow of Salvador Allende’s democratically elected government in Chile in the 1970s.
It is possible that Kissinger’s most reactionary tendencies are now reemerging.
Putting aside ideology, we know that Kissinger is fascinated, if not obsessed, with power.
He may be unable to resist the temptation to be close to it, and to have an enduring influence relatively comparable to that of Elizabeth II. But Kissinger should remember what the young queen’s private tutor taught her about British politics: the prime minister must be “efficient,” and the Crown must be “dignified.”
Is it dignified to offer reassurances about Trump’s fitness to lead the world’s most powerful country through a period of far-reaching change?
Historians studying the twenty-first century may one day conclude that the “American Century” ended – and the “Asian Century” began – on November 8, 2016, with Trump’s election victory.
If so, it is only fitting that the man who helped open China to the world in the early 1970s should join forces with the president who will unwittingly pass the torch of history to the Chinese.

The Supply-Chain Mess
BOSTON – Global supply chains used to be the last thing policymakers worried about.
The topic was largely the concern of academics, who studied the possible efficiency gains and potential risks associated with this aspect of globalization.
Although Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 had demonstrated how supply-chain disruptions could impact the global economy, few anticipated how central the problem could become.
Not anymore.
Today’s supply-chain bottlenecks are creating shortages, propping up inflation, and preoccupying policymakers around the world.
US President Joe Biden’s administration deserves credit for recognizing that supply chains are key to future economic security.
In February 2021, Biden issued an executive order directing several federal agencies to secure and strengthen the American supply chain; and in June, the White House published a 100-day review on “Building Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad-Based Growth.”
This 250-page report contains many important proposals.
Some are already part of the broader discussion on improving the US workforce’s skills and the economy’s capacity for innovation.
Other ideas have been circulating for a while in international relations and security studies; for example, the document considers the national-security implications of defense and other critical industries’ reliance on imported inputs.
But the review’s most important contribution is its observation that global supply chains have imposed various social costs: “Our private sector and public policy approach to domestic production, which for years prioritized efficiency and low costs over security, sustainability and resilience, has resulted in supply chain risks.” The review then asks whether hyper-globalized supply chains are so great for economic efficiency after all.
The default position among economists is “yes, they are.” When two firms enter into a transaction in which each will gain something, that is good for both firms and also probably for the rest of the economy, owing to the resulting efficiency improvements and cost reductions.
Whether this involves a US manufacturer offshoring the production of some inputs to a Chinese firm is beside the point.
Yet supply chains can pose a danger to an economy in two important ways (beyond the defense-related concerns mentioned above).
The more complex a supply chain becomes, the greater the economic risks.
A break in any link can affect the whole chain and send prices surging if it creates sudden shortages of a necessary input.
The worst-case scenario is when a failure in one part of the chain triggers domino effects, bringing down other firms and bringing the entire sector to a standstill.
Logically, this scenario is similar to what one finds in financial networks, where the failure of one bank can push others into insolvency or even bankruptcy, as happened in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
In principle, because uncertainty is costly, businesses will take these risks into account when deciding to build supply chains.
In practice, however, there are good economic reasons why firms may overextend their supply chains.
For one thing, firms will account for their own risk, but not for the systemic effects they are creating, nor for the risks they are imposing on other firms or the entire economy.
Moreover, when global competition creates powerful incentives to reduce costs, even small price differences offered by foreign suppliers can become attractive, especially in the short term.
In this age of stock-market options and hefty bonuses, financial interests also factor into managers’ considerations.
CEOs enjoy immediate compensation when they can achieve cost reductions and increase profits, whereas the significant costs of future uncertainty – or even bankruptcy – will likely be someone else’s problem.
A second way that companies may overextend their supply chain is subtler but no less important.
The problem, the White House review notes, is that “the United States has taken certain features of global markets – especially the fear that companies and capital will flee to wherever wages, taxes and regulation are lowest – as inevitable.”
This statement echoes economist Dani Rodrik’s prescient observation that globalization is not just about trade in goods and services; it is also about the sharing of rents.
As such, the globalization of supply chains is an integral part of the shifting balance between capital and labor.
The most straightforward mechanism for this process is the offshoring of inputs, the mere threat of which can be used by managers to keep wages low.
This happens on both ends of the offshoring transaction: US companies can pay less to their employees by expanding their supply chain to countries (such as China or Vietnam) where wages are already lower as a result of lax labor regulations.
A fragmented supply chain may also make it more difficult for workers to organize for collective bargaining, creating yet another benefit for businesses.
Companies may even reap tax advantages from globalizing their supply chain, if doing so allows them to book profits in lower-tax jurisdictions.
This second reason is problematic for the US economy as well.
It suggests that managers will tend to globalize their companies’ supply chains even when doing so is not more efficient, simply because doing so allows them to shift rents away from workers and toward shareholders.
Not only does this create an excessively overextended supply chain; it also distorts the income distribution by suppressing wages, especially for low- and middle-skill workers.
The White House report proposes keeping more of the supply chain in the US, especially in manufacturing.
But how can this be achieved?
A two-pronged approach would be the most effective.
First, the need for meaningful inducements for businesses to invest in their domestic supply chains implies that the tax advantages of offshoring inputs should be eliminated, and the opportunities for labor-regulation arbitrage should be curtailed.
But other, more fundamental changes are also needed.
The global supply-chain mess is an opportunity for the US to have a broader conversation about the economy and what it is for.
As long as CEOs remain obsessed with short-term stock-market performance, bolstered by the ideology of “shareholder value,” they will seek ways to shift rents away from their workers, whatever the risks.

President Bush Goes Soft
The first term of George W. Bush’s presidency was marked by unilateralism and military power.
The United States was the world’s only superpower, so others had to follow.
The result was a dramatic decline in America’s “soft” or attractive power.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said he did not know what soft power was.
Now it is back in fashion in Washington.
Bush’s second inaugural address was devoted to the power of liberty and democracy.
Such rhetoric is not new to American presidents.
Harry Truman spoke of defending free people everywhere, and Woodrow Wilson spoke of promoting democracy.
The neo-conservatives in Bush’s first administration were in that tradition, but ignored the fact that both Wilson and Truman were also institution-builders who consulted other countries.
In dropping that half of Wilson’s approach, they stepped on their own message, reducing its effectiveness.
The tone at the beginning of the second Bush administration is different.
As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said recently in Paris: “I use the word ‘power’ broadly, because even more important than military and indeed economic power is the power of ideas, the power of compassion, and the power of hope.”
Bush not only chose to visit Brussels, the capital of the European Union, on his February trip to Europe, but stated that what “we seek to achieve in the world requires that America and Europe remain close partners.”
Even Rumsfeld is trying to be conciliatory!
Will Bush’s new approach succeed?
On a recent trip to Europe, I encountered both encouragement and skepticism.
Many people welcomed the new tone, but wondered if it was simply sugarcoated cynicism.
Words must be matched by deeds before people are convinced.
One place to look to see if deeds are forthcoming is in Bush’s latest budget.
The budget cuts discretionary spending (other than defense and homeland security) by nearly 1%, and slashes as many as 150 domestic programs.
Yet, in this climate of fiscal stringency, he calls for increased contributions to international organizations, the Millennium Challenge Account to provide assistance to countries with a commitment to making progress in poverty reduction, and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative.
Bush’s new budget also includes an increase in funding for public diplomacy.
The allocation for the State Department’s educational and cultural exchange programs, including overseas research centers, libraries, and visitor programs, is boosted by nearly 25%.
As Bush’s budget request to Congress puts it, “Rarely has the need for a sustained effort to ensure foreign understanding for our country and society been so clearly evident.”
This comes after a first term in which public diplomacy was a neglected stepchild, and a Pentagon advisory panel summed up the situation as a “crisis.”
Even with these increases, there is a long way to go to improve America’s standing.
A recent non-partisan report by the Public Diplomacy Council called for a new Agency for Public Diplomacy within the State Department, 24-hour English-language broadcasts by the Voice of America, and a fourfold budget increase over the next five years.
The Bush administration still has much to do in promoting ideas, but early indications suggest a change from the neglect of the first term.
But it will not be enough for Bush to start his second term with grand rhetoric about values and increased investment in public diplomacy.
A country’s attractiveness or soft power stems partly from its culture and values (where they are attractive to others), but it also grows out of a country’s policies when they are seen as legitimate, consultative, and inclusive of the interests of others.
Unless the policies fit the values, the discrepancy will give rise to charges of hypocrisy.
At a minimum, Bush will need to pursue policies – in a more consultative manner – that seek a political solution in Iraq and progress in the Israel-Palestine peace process.
Here too, the early signs are encouraging.
The 60% turnout in the January elections and the scenes of Iraqis risking their lives to vote has led to hopes that a political settlement in Iraq may be possible.
The elections are but a first step; the insurgency continues; civil war remains possible.
Nonetheless, the elections may have softened some of the sense of illegitimacy that has clouded Bush’s Iraq policy.
Similarly, with regard to the Middle East peace process, the replacement of Yasir Arafat by Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian elections, and the meetings between Abbas and Ariel Sharon suggest progress.
On difficult nuclear issues, such as North Korea and Iran, Bush has pursued multilateral consultation and coordination with other powers.
Of course, this still leaves unresolved other multilateral issues, like the International Criminal Court and global climate change.
There is little prospect that Bush will reverse his rejection of the Kyoto Treaty, but it will be interesting to see how far he accommodates Prime Minister Tony Blair’s efforts to make climate change a priority during Britain’s period as chair of the Group of Eight major economies.
It is much too early for a verdict on Bush’s second term policies.
As he looks ahead to the verdict of history, he seems to realize that hard power alone will not consolidate his reputation, but he remains hostage to incidents and accidents that could drive even his best-laid plans off course.
Nonetheless, the most striking thing at this point in Bush’s second term is his belated discovery of the importance of diplomacy and soft power.

A War of Words Fought over Women’s Bodies
NEW YORK – This month, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a high-level meeting to secure a commitment by member states to deliver universal health coverage (UHC), including financial risk protection and access to essential health-care services, medicines, and vaccines for all.
But just how much countries commit to services that meet the unique needs of girls and women as part of their UHC implementation is still up for debate.
By adopting a political declaration on UHC, countries are agreeing to allocate funding from their national budgets to create a future in which diabetics everywhere get insulin, HIV isn’t left to ravage communities, and all children receive essential vaccinations.
In that future, even the most vulnerable communities would have reliable and affordable access to the services they need, and the entire society would be healthier and more productive.
And yet the unique health needs of girls and women, not least their sexual and reproductive health needs, remain a matter of political contention, which has long caused their health care to be undervalued and under-resourced.
In humanitarian settings, for example, there is very little access to sexual and reproductive health care.
And in many places, young people have difficulties exercising their reproductive rights.
Undermining women’s health further, women are often under-represented in medical trials, leading to inadequate diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
Even programs that are intended specifically to serve adolescent girls are often designed without meaningful youth engagement; as a result, they often fail to meet their target users’ needs and, at times, even reinforce damaging stigmas.
But for universal health coverage to be truly universal and transformative, it must embrace gender equality in all forms – and that also means providing explicit guarantees of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).
This includes modern contraception, pre-and post-natal care, infertility treatment, safe abortion, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and cancers of the reproductive organs.
It also includes the right to consent to sex and to be safe from intimate partner violence.
These health services save lives.
If the need for modern contraception were met in developing regions, and women and newborns received essential care, unintended pregnancies would drop by 75%, maternal deaths would decline by 73%, and newborn deaths would drop by 80%.
Vaccinating girls against the human papilloma virus (HPV) would avert more than three million deaths from cervical cancer over the next decade in 72 low- and middle-income countries.
And, of course, healthier mothers have healthier children.
Protecting women’s health and guaranteeing their autonomy over their own bodies, sexuality, and fertility is the bedrock of gender equality.
SRHR enables women to reach their full potential by, among other things, participating in their economies, politics, and societies.
This boosts the wellbeing of families and communities, thereby contributing to overall economic growth and sustainable development.
Despite these enormous benefits, experience suggests that unless SRHR is explicitly protected in UN declarations, it is likelier to be left out of policy deliberations and budgets.
Ensuring such protections is an uphill battle, because conservative UN member states push to strike words like “gender” and “sexual and reproductive health and rights,” and sometimes even “human rights,” from various international declarations.
There is a war of words being fought in the multilateral system, and women’s bodies are the battleground.
That is why the Alliance for Gender Equality and UHC – which comprises more than 100 civil society organizations from 46 countries – has been calling on UN member states not to allow a victory for those seeking to undermine women’s health and rights.
The deletion of these words has very real consequences.
“Health care for all” includes sexual and reproductive health, and “all” includes every person, regardless of race, ethnicity, age, ability, migration status, gender identity or expression, indigeneity, health condition, class, or caste.
To have any chance of delivering this, SRHR must be recognized, funded, and manifested in every country and community in the world.
The fight now moves from words on a page to action.
If governments are serious about UHC, they must commit to building and funding comprehensive health-care systems that work for all people, including girls and women.
The result will be a healthier, wealthier, and more equal world.

The Future of Facts
BUDAPEST – At a recent conference of newspaper editors in which I took part, a small crowd gathered to talk about journalism and new media.
When I told the group that I had begun my career as a magazine fact-checker, several of them grew misty-eyed, as if someone had told a group of priests about his childhood as an altar boy.
I brought up my past because I think that fact-checking is the single best training not just for journalism, but for life in general.
It teaches you to think skeptically.
It is easy to believe something when someone who appears knowledgeable asserts it.
But if you have a responsibility for checking facts, you listen more carefully.
On what sources does the speaker base his facts?
Is there something in it for him – a higher stock price, an advertising fee, or someone else’s gratitude?
Or is he simply biased because of the people he knows, the company he works for, or the attitudes he picked up at home?
I spent hours picking through sources – mostly dusty papers in the years before the Internet, or strangers on the telephone – to clarify questions of fact: Was this really the first such product?
Was Mr. Smith 42 or already 43?
Was his claim that revenues had grown for the last five years true merely because of acquisitions that his company had made?
And so on.
My life was ruled by tk – which stands for “to kum,” or “to come,” in the jargon of reporters.
We fact-checkers would joke about the lazy reporters who would hand us copy such as, “Juan Tigar, tk years old, grew up in tk before studying at tk.
Now tk title at Widgets Corp., he…” Our job was to fill in the tk’s.
But we learned an enormous amount.
We learned not just thousands of facts that I have since forgotten, but an attitude of skepticism coupled with reverence for the truth.
That attitude contrasts with the skepticism I once heard from a Russian reporter about her early days on the job. “Whenever we read an article about the health dangers of butter, we would immediately run out and buy as much butter as we could find,” she told me.
“We knew it meant there was about to be a butter shortage.” In other words, Russians looked only for the agenda, the motivation behind the assertion.
Of course, spin, propaganda, and censorship persist in journalism, but with one big difference: Almost anyone can now operate as a reporter.
How can we ensure that these self-nominated reporters respect the truth?
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has announced plans to require bloggers and celebrity endorsers to disclose gifts or payments from vendors and others seeking the bloggers’ positive comments online.
But what about other kinds of bias?
As the journalistic priesthood erodes and everyone can become a citizen reporter or commentator, regulating or training all would-be journalists is not the answer.
In line with the bottom-up, do-it-yourself ethos of the Internet, where people book their own flights, publish their own photos, and sell their own second-hand goods, it should be the users’ responsibility to do their own fact-checking.
This is not to say that journalists should not check their own facts (or that priests should not observe the tenets of their own religion).
But in the end, everyone has to become a better reader – more skeptical and more curious.
Why is this story getting so much attention?
Does this blogger ever say anything negative, or is she always talking about the great products she uses?
Does she have any kind of disclosures on her blog?
Why is this politician saying nice things about that politician?
What company does the product reviewer work for?
Governments can impose regulations, but in the end we will get the kind of journalism for which we ask.
If we ask for it, Web sites will offer not just content but reputation systems, so that contributors will have reputations as reliable sources (or not).
We should not outlaw anonymity (which has its uses), but we can ask for details about the people whose words we are reading.
Someone may legitimately want to remain anonymous, but we can draw our own conclusions about their reasons.
That much thinking may sound like a lot of work, but it is what is required of a responsible adult these days.
Compared to a century ago, more people spend less time laboring to ensure their physical existence.
But, in this increasingly confusing world, we need to spend a little more time laboring to ensure our own intellectual integrity – a task that we cannot outsource to governments or even to media.
Facts are holy, but not all media that claim to report them, “new” or old, can be trusted.

The Silver Fox of Dictatorship and Democracy
MOSCOW – Throughout his years in power, Eduard Shevardnadze was known as the “silver fox,” a man who seemed to glide effortlessly from leader of Soviet Georgia and Kremlin Politburo member to Mikhail Gorbachev’s reform-minded foreign minister, before reemerging as post-Soviet Georgia’s pro-Western president, ironically opposing Gorbachev.
He regarded himself as a hero who liberated Georgia from Russia’s tight embrace.
He was also one of the most corrupt politicians his country ever saw.
By the end of his life, Shevardnadze had become a political pariah in Georgia, the West, and Russia, where he was viewed as an architect of the Soviet Union’s dissolution.
Yet, even if he was largely forgotten after the Rose Revolution of 2003, when he was ousted by his one-time protégé, Mikheil Saakashvili, his cunning and skill at manipulating political forces still enabled him to manage his legacy to his advantage.
The staunchly pro-American Saakashvili launched successful economic reforms and an all-out assault on police corruption, though he, too, eventually was accused of taking bribes and indulging autocratic impulses.
Having come to power in the revolt that overthrew the corrupt Shevardnadze, he resorted to the same Soviet-style techniques – intimidating and discrediting opponents, dispersing dissenters by force – to keep his opponents at bay.
The question Georgians have been asking ever since is whether Shevardnadze was really overthrown at all.
Knowing the extent of his unpopularity in 2003, many believe that he was ready to leave power but needed a successor who would ensure that his legacy (and his wealth) survived.
To be sure, Saakashvili became famous as Georgia’s justice minister for submitting corruption charges against the Shevardnadze family, and early in his presidency was able to reclaim for the state $15 million dollars of the Shevardnadze fortune.
But Saakashvili’s government never touched Shevardnadze and his family.
Regardless of whether this theory is true, its persistence lies at the core of Shevardnadze’s legacy.
Throughout his career, he was known to play all sides, at times threatening his resignation, only to stay on – or accusing enemies of assassination plots, only to stay alive.
In the 1970s, he would flatter Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev with spectacular displays of fealty to the Kremlin, only to meet with protesting Georgian students in support of their right, in opposition to the Kremlin’s wishes, to speak Georgian, not Russian, as a state language.
Everything at which Georgians excelled under Shevardnadze in the Soviet era – entrepreneurship, education, and culture – was greatly neglected by him in the 1990s.
Similarly, whereas tens of thousands of functionaries were indicted for corruption or lost their jobs under his leadership in the 1970s, the post-Soviet Shevardnadze of the 1990s reportedly joked that he should have arrested himself, but that he deserved his wealth for his priceless political contribution.
In 1999, during the New York celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, I myself heard Shevardnadze assert that Georgia had given the twentieth century two historic figures: “One who erected the Iron Curtain [Joseph Stalin], and one who tore it down” – meaning himself.
Surely, Shevardnadze’s political skills were worthy of another great Soviet politician from the Caucasus, the Armenian Anastas Mikoyan, once Stalin’s trusted trade minister and later Nikita Khrushchev’s fellow anti-Stalinist and deputy prime minister.
Mikoyan, as one joke had it, left the Kremlin one day in heavy rain and refused to share a colleague’s umbrella. “It’s ok,” he said, “I will walk between the raindrops.”
Likewise, Shevardnadze resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia in the 1980s, ostensibly in protest against Soviet rule, only to be appointed Soviet Foreign Minister by Gorbachev.
Having gained the trust of Western leaders and overseen the dismantling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, he then resigned in 1990, declaring that Russia – under Gorbachev – was returning to dictatorship.
That pose as democracy’s guardian earned Shevardnadze independent Georgia’s presidency at a time when the country was vulnerable to civil war.
He held the post for 11 years.
Was Shevardnadze ever honest?
Was he a democrat or a despot?
The reality of the times was that he was both.
His death brings closer the end of the Gorbachev generation of reform communists, those who – like Shevardnadze and the late Boris Yeltsin – presented a stark contrast in the late 1980s to the dour Brezhnev-era hard-liners, spurring (mostly inadvertently) the collapse of the Soviet empire and the long transition to democracy.
As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s corrupt and authoritarian rule demonstrates every day, that transition is far from finished.
Yet there is some good news.
Last year, Georgia elected its new president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, through a peaceful and legitimate process; earlier this summer, the country signed a European Union Association Agreement, implying closer connections to the West.
None of this would have been possible without Shevardnadze’s decades-long career of cunning, yet brave, political triangulation.

Puerto Rico’s Debt Trap
WASHINGTON, DC – The Caribbean island of Puerto Rico – the largest United States “territory” – is broke, and a human calamity is unfolding there.
Unless a constructive course of political action is found in 2016, Puerto Rican migration to the 50 states will rival the scale of the 1930s Dust Bowl exodus from Oklahoma, Arkansas, and other climate-devastated states.
With public debt service (principal plus interest) projected to reach nearly 40% of government revenue in 2016, Puerto Rico needs a new set of economic policies.
But austerity will not work; this must be an investment-led recovery, with official measures oriented toward boosting growth by reducing the cost of doing business.
The question is whether Puerto Rico will have that option.
Much of its $73 billion debt has been issued by government corporations.
But, though federal law allows such municipal debt to be restructured under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code in all 50 states, this does not apply to US territories like Puerto Rico.
As a result, a protracted series of confusing legal battles and selective defaults looms.
The cost of essential infrastructure services – electricity, water, sewers, and transportation – will go up while quality declines.
One response has been to demand further belt-tightening, for example, in the form of wage reductions and healthcare cuts.
But residents of Puerto Rico are also US citizens and they vote with their feet – the population has fallen from 3.9 million to 3.5 million in recent years as talented and energetic people have moved to Florida, Texas, and other parts of the mainland.
The more creditors insist on lower living standards and higher taxes, the more the tax base will simply leave the island – causing bondholders’ losses to rise.
Disorganized defaults by public corporations will make it hard for any part of the private credit system to function.
Leading conservatives in the US – including at the Hoover Institution – have long argued in favor of using established bankruptcy procedures when large financial firms fail.
The same logic applies here: A judge can remove any doubt that actual insolvency exists, while also ensuring that credit remains available during a restructuring.
During that process, a judge can rely on precedent and ensure fairness across creditor classes based on the precise terms under which loans were obtained.
Although congressional Republicans have so far refused to allow for a judge-supervised bankruptcy process, bipartisan agreement remains possible.
Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Charles E. Schumer have proposed legislation that would introduce a stay on creditor lawsuits until March 31, 2016.
No one, including Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, Chair of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, believes that debt restructuring by itself will bring back growth; but extending Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code to Puerto Rico would help.
Puerto Rico needs private-sector investment, which requires taking three steps.
For starters, bureaucratic hurdles to job creation should be eliminated, including by using state-of-the-art technology to make government more transparent.
Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress, has long emphasized this point.
Second, the cost of essential inputs for industry needs to fall.
Electricity on the island is significantly more expensive than in Florida, in part because of underinvestment.
More broadly, there are pressing needs for public investment to improve infrastructure, which implies great opportunities for private-sector participation.
But none of this will happen until the debt overhang is removed.
Finally, Puerto Rico needs better fiscal management.
The island’s idiosyncratic tax and expenditure system – and the lack of effective local control over fiscal policy – has become part of the longer-term problem.
Puerto Rico should, over time, become more like one of the 50 states in its fiscal relationship with the federal government.
If Congress is willing to commit to that path, a reasonable quid pro quo would be strong fiscal rules – and a powerful monitoring body.
With congressional support and pro-growth policies, Puerto Rico can attract talented Americans (and legal immigrants) to move to the island, start companies, and work hard.
Higher education in Puerto Rico remains strong, but more than 80,000 people leave every year (and only 20,000 move in).
In part, high levels of net migration reflect Puerto Rico’s badly frayed health-care system.
The federal government provides significantly more support to every state health-care system through Medicare (for pensioners) and Medicaid (for low-income households), despite the fact that Puerto Ricans pay the same federal payroll taxes that fund much of the Medicare program.
Likewise, to become eligible for more robust support, including through the earned-income tax credit – a program supported by leading conservatives, such as Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan – hard-working low-income Puerto Ricans must move to one of the 50 states.
Puerto Rico doesn’t need a bailout.
It needs to reduce the cost of doing business – cut the red tape, encourage investment, and attract people to work (and pay tax in) a beautiful place.
It also needs what has been a constructive part of the American economic model over 200 years – the ability to restructure municipal debt through bankruptcy.

The Caudillo of the Kremlin
MOSCOW – Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown his regime’s real intentions.
By changing the constitution to allow him to remain in office until 2036 and incorporating conservative new language, it has cast off its teetering mask of democratic legitimacy.
But just as Putin has sought to entrench his rule, his regime is looking weaker than ever.
In the city of Khabarovsk, tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in recent weeks, chanting, “Putin resign!” They are not alone.
While Putin’s approval rating may seem high, it is low by Russian standards.
In fact, his 59-60% approval rating in recent months is his lowest since October 1999, when he was prime minister.
And it is unlikely to improve significantly for a simple reason: Putin tried-and-tested methods to win support have lost their firepower.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Russia hard, in terms of both public health and economic fallout.
With oil exports, the mainstay of Russia’s economy, down sharply, the government’s budget revenues have cratered.
As a result, the Kremlin’s tacit pact with the public – we ensure your basic wellbeing, and you don’t complain – is unraveling.
Putin’s regime has long sought to divert public attention from domestic problems by touting its foreign-policy victories and its unrelenting battle against a domestic “fifth column.”
Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 embodied what have long been his most effective tactics for securing support: xenophobia, anti-Western hysteria, and the invocation of a glorious past.
His approval rating skyrocketed to more than 85%.
For Putin, however, the impression of broad public support is arguably more important than the support itself.
The July 1 plebiscite on the constitutional amendments meant little in practice.
The changes had been ratified by the Duma (parliament) and regional legislatures months before.
But the popular vote gave the Kremlin the opportunity to claim that nearly 78% of Russia’s citizens supported the changes.
And it could cite the 21% who, according to official figures, voted against the changes to refute the many accusations – including from the European Union – that the vote was rigged.
High voter turnout enhanced the façade.
But the fact that so many people participated under duress – they often had to report to their employers that they had voted – could end up hurting Putin in regional elections this year and in 2021, when federal parliamentary elections will also be held.
Unlike in a plebiscite, people will be able to cast protest votes.
The Kremlin’s heavy use of another favorite tactic – firing, arresting, or otherwise removing ideological opponents – could also backfire.
In early July, the authorities detained two activists – including Andrei Pivovarov, the executive director of exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Open Russia pro-democracy movement – who were campaigning against Putin’s plans to prolong his rule.
Four others had their homes searched.
Several journalists have also been targeted in recent weeks, including Svetlana Prokopyeva (fined for supposedly inciting terrorism) and Ivan Safronov (charged with treason).
Pyotr Verzilov, the publisher of Mediazona, a news site that chronicles abuse in Russia’s justice system, has had his home searched repeatedly.
Likewise, the historian Yuri Dmitriev, whose work exposing Stalin’s crimes has cast doubt on Kremlin hagiography, received a prison sentence for sexual violence against a minor.
And last month, celebrated theater director Kirill Serebrennikov was convicted of embezzlement – part of an effort to crack down on independent theater.
These are proven tactics, but they are also transparent.
And, though a loyal segment of society approves, others – including formerly loyal constituencies – are pushing back.
The Khabarovsk protests were triggered by the sudden arrest of the popular governor, Sergei Furgal, for his alleged involvement in murders dating back to 2004-05, when he worked in business.
Furgal is no liberal; he is a member of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, part of the “systemic opposition” in the Duma.
But he won his position in 2018 by defeating a Kremlin-backed candidate.
By arresting him, the Kremlin likely wanted to send a message to regional leaders who might try to capitalize on the national government’s failures during the COVID-19 crisis.
Instead, the arrest immediately tarnished the image of national unity that the plebiscite result was supposed to project.
To be sure, the Khabarovsk protests alone do not pose a threat to Putin’s rule.
Their effects will be felt nationwide only if they spread to other cities, especially Moscow.
But they should worry the Kremlin nonetheless.
In Khabarovsk, it is not just professionals who are protesting, as has usually been the case.
Мany protesters can hardly be considered politicized intelligentsia from Moscow or Saint Petersburg.
Those in the streets previously would have been part of Putin’s social base.
And they are setting an example for other regions.
Yet Putin’s sclerotic regime has little choice but to continue relying on the same approaches.
The line between those the Kremlin supports (the millions of law-enforcement and security officers, bureaucrats, and other state employees, not to mention loyal oligarchs) and those it doesn’t (virtually everyone else) is growing sharper.
Still, there is no clear political or social force in place that will hasten the regime’s erosion.
If a fatal blow comes, it will be dealt by an unlikely source.
As the Khabarovsk protests have shown, however, unexpected surges of resistance are hardly beyond the realm of possibility.
In any case, Putin’s strategy of preserving power by any means necessary will not solve Russia’s many problems.
And there remains the question of what will happen to the system after him.
What we are witnessing is a further “Francoization” of the Russian political regime: Putin is laying the groundwork to remain head of state for life, as Spain’s Francisco Franco did with the 1947 Law of Succession.
But as Europe grew wealthy in the postwar era, Spain atrophied decade after decade under Franco’s increasingly dozy regime.
Putin seems set on achieving the same level of inertia – in politics, the economy, and society.
But Franco at least had a successor in mind.
By having the monarchy restored on Franco’s death, King Juan Carlos could ascend the throne.
Putin, however, is leading Russia into a dead end.
After all, he cannot bring back the czar.
So he has simply postponed the problem of succession.
Après lui, le déluge.

The Next Gas Crisis Awaits
Europe’s sigh of relief at the supposed end of the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas pricing was audible here in Kyiv.
But the settlement raises more questions than it answers.
By placing Ukraine’s energy needs in the hands of a shadowy company linked to international criminals, the agreement has planted the seeds of new and perhaps more dangerous crises.
As a result, I am challenging this deal in court and asked the members of my party to vote no confidence in the government.
Let a public hearing before a judge reveal exactly who will benefit from this deal, and let parliament examine all of the agreement’s terms and secret protocols.
The settlement between Ukraine and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, is intolerable because Ukraine’s energy future has been placed in the hands of RosUkrEnergo, a criminal canker on the body of our state gas corporation.
RosUkrEnergo was established in the last months of the regime of our former ruler, Leonid Kuchma.
Yet it miraculously gained control of all of Ukraine’s gas imports from Central Asia.
Under the deal agreed this week, it retains that control.
As one who worked in the gas industry before entering politics, I know that the gas trade in the countries of the former Soviet Union is riddled with corruption.
During my premiership, my government sought to investigate RosUkrEnergo – to discover who precisely its owners are, how it gained a virtual monopoly on the import of Central Asian gas, and where its profits go.
Now that I am not in government, that investigation has been shelved.
Ukraine’s energy needs, and thus the certainty of energy supplies across Europe, will never be secure as long as gas transit is in the hands of secretive companies with unknown owners.
But the issues raised by the gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia go beyond energy security, reviving questions about Ukraine’s place in Europe and the world.
As this struggle shows, Ukraine has been obliged to assume a higher-profile role in European affairs.
It must consider where and in what sort of Europe it fits, what balance it should strike between Russia and the European Union, and how it should find the self-assurance needed to play its full part in world affairs.
It would be sheer folly to suggest that Ukrainians start with a blank slate.
Centuries of being part of the Russian and Soviet empires have, in different ways, shaped how Ukrainians view their country and its interests.
One consequence of this is that Ukrainians are often shy about asserting Ukraine’s independent interests plainly – exemplified by Ukraine’s acceptance of a deal that leaves its energy future so insecure.
Like any country, Ukraine’s relations with the world are determined by four interlocking factors: history, patriotism, national interests, and geography.
Each factor has special resonance here.
True, Ukrainians rightly feel like citizens of a normal, independent country, and want to be treated that way.
But this does not mean we want to bury history and our historic ties.
We are a normal country with an abnormal history.
Indeed, Ukraine’s interests form a comfortingly familiar triangle of economic, political, and strategic priorities: free trade and open markets across the globe; prosperous and democratic neighbors; and not being on the front-line of a conflict, still less a potential battleground, between Russia and the West.
Our goal is thus a democratic Ukraine located between prosperous like-minded neighbors to east and west.
Of course, the risk of tyranny, turmoil, and war within the so-called “post-Soviet space” is large, leaving Ukraine keen to limit its vulnerability.
Ukrainian enthusiasm about the EU is based on the idea that European security is indivisible.
We recognize, of course, that few of even the most fervent supporters of European integration want to help Ukraine quickly become a member.
But the risk to EU gas supplies shows that our fates are linked.
Europe must play its part as Ukraine redefines its historic ties to Russia, and its actions must do nothing to undermine Ukraine’s national independence – or, indeed, that of any of the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s breakup.
The proposed Baltic Sea pipeline, which would bring gas to Germany directly from Russia, bypassing Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states, and the rest of Central Europe, is dangerous in this regard, because it may allow Gazprom the freedom to cut gas supplies to customers without endangering supplies to its favored western markets.
That is a recipe for renewed threats, not only to Ukraine, but to EU members like Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the three Baltic states.
In broad terms, Ukraine seeks security and stability, and it should be remembered that our record here is strong.
Our decision more than a decade ago to surrender Ukraine’s status as a nuclear nation is the clearest sign of our good neighborly intentions and political maturity.
Today’s crisis over gas supplies must not be overblown.
Objectively speaking, Ukraine today is more secure as a nation than at any time in its history.
But Ukrainians do not feel as secure as they should.
The way to deal with uncertainty and complex situations is to think clearly and act decisively, not cut deals that place Ukraine’s future in the hands of shadowy businesses.
Only by clearly articulating and defending Ukraine’s national interests can today’s dispute over gas supplies establish our role in a transformed Europe.

Post-Communist Lessons for the Green Transition
BRUSSELS – Three decades after the events that lifted the Iron Curtain and sparked the integration of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe into the global economy, we are on the cusp of a new historic transition.
This time, however, it is the entire world that will change.
As we shift to a climate-friendly, truly digital economy, we should heed the lessons of post-communist Europe in the 1990s.
One is that norms and behavioral patterns that have been hardwired into society cannot be reversed overnight.
Change takes time, which is why it is never too early to begin the process.
A second lesson is that any transition path will be rocky.
Like the evolution of political and economic systems after communism, the transition to a “net-zero” society risks disrupting individual lives and deepening social inequalities.
Some jobs that were once thought to be secure for life will necessarily disappear, which means that the process must be inclusive from the start.
In practice, making social cohesion and solidarity a top-level priority throughout the transition will require providing concrete support to help people seize new opportunities, as well as managing expectations to avoid disillusionment.
With hindsight, we know that the societal upheaval 30 years ago was worth it, because it produced so many success stories.
We therefore should not fear the green transition.
It, too, offers new opportunity to build a more prosperous world.
Investments in human and physical capital will be the key to this transition.
For change to be inclusive, we will need to invest more in schools, universities, and adult learning.
In Europe and beyond, the green transformation will hinge on people’s creativity and technological and scientific prowess.
A third lesson is that to mobilize the necessary investments, policymakers will need to send clear signals and provide real incentives.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, European post-communist countries followed a roadmap defined by the so-called Washington Consensus, a set of market-liberalizing reforms.
The opportunity to join the European Union served as a powerful incentive to embrace these policies, and the need to harmonize their legislation with EU law provided a detailed blueprint for implementing them.
The EU accession process, in turn, prompted substantial capital inflows, much of it direct investment, which supported the region’s integration into global value chains.
With the green transition, the institutional path is not as clear; indeed, we are still piecing it together.
Once again, the United States and the EU will need to take the lead and provide policy guidance.
We should establish a new Transatlantic Partnership for Climate to develop fully compatible regulatory frameworks and a common vision on carbon pricing.
The private sector is eager for more clarity on the emerging taxonomies for sustainable investment.
Now that the US has reaffirmed its climate commitments, the same transatlantic relationship that inspired democratic reforms in Europe 30 years ago can become the engine of the green transition.
Involving China and India and leveraging the power of the G20 will be easier if the transatlantic partners are acting jointly.
But to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions in time, Europe will need to ratchet up its spending on research and development.
The International Energy Agency estimates that carbon dioxide emissions fell about 8% last year, owing to the COVID-19 lockdowns.
If we are to hold global warming within 1.5°C of pre-industrial temperatures, emissions must fall by the same margin every year for the next decade.
Obviously, we cannot achieve those kinds of sustained reductions through more lockdowns, nor can we rely on any other kind of sudden forced change in behavior.
What we need is massive investment in new technologies.
To hit its 2030 emissions-reduction target (55% below 1990 levels), Europe must mobilize an estimated €350 billion ($418 billion) of additional investment per year.
In the post-communist transformation, technological transfers and new innovations helped to propel growth and job creation in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe.
To drive breakthroughs in climate technologies, Europe needs to exhibit a greater willingness to fund ideas that are not yet ready for the market.
It cannot simply replicate the best innovations from elsewhere.
While the EU’s knowledge-sharing platforms and venture capital funds represent steps in the right direction, they are not ambitious enough.
Research shows that the carbon footprint shrinks faster in economies that receive more funding from equity markets than from credit markets.
Likewise, Europe’s green taxonomy discussion is necessary, but it ought to go further.
We must create an investment environment that will produce a truly just transition.
When new technologies do emerge, they need to be able to grow to scale and become attractive for developed as well as developing countries around the world.
Like the post-communist transition in the 1990s, climate action, technological innovation, and economic development should become inseparable parts of a single strategy to achieve a singular transformation.

Shards of Europe
PRINCETON – As European leaders struggle after another failed summit, they should think hard about what their continent – and the world – might look like if they continue to produce unsatisfactory solutions to Europe’s financial and economic problems.
What would follow the disintegration of the eurozone and – almost certainly with it – that of the European Union?
The best place to consider that question would not be Brussels, but Tiraspol, the capital of the entity that calls itself the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, or Trans-Dniestr.
This territorial sliver with a population of a half-million emerged in the early 1990’s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (population almost 300 million), when it broke away from the Republic of Moldova (population four million), which had separated in the 1940’s from Ukraine (population 50 million).
Trans-Dniestr has its own government and parliament, army, constitution, flag, and a rousing Soviet-style national anthem; of course, its nationhood would be incomplete without its own currency.
This political entity is a precise counterpart in the political world to a well-known physical phenomenon of splintering or fissuring. When stressed, a big surface bifurcates in big chunks, but then the disintegration continues into smaller and smaller fragments.
Of the six larger EU states, only France has a really well-defined centralized political system. Poland’s centralism comes close, but strong regional differences persist – a legacy of the three large and quite different imperial systems that encompassed today’s Poland in the nineteenth century.
Italy and Germany were nineteenth-century amalgamations of a colorful variety of small and medium-size political units.
The United Kingdom looks older and more stable, but Scotland today is controlled by a political party that wants to repeal the 1707 Act of Union, with the future to be determined by a Scottish referendum in 2014.
Spain after the Franco dictatorship stabilized itself by granting autonomy to its regions, which in many ways now behave like independent units.
In these fragmented political areas, the logic of integration in the past depended on areas that were dissatisfied with political outcomes appealing to new allies in larger units.
Franconians in southern Germany disliked the fact that the Napoleonic Wars subjected them to Bavarian rule; they saw German nationalism as a way to use Prussia and Berlin as a counterweight to Munich’s hegemony.
But, once Germany was united, Bavarians did not like the outcome, and then thought of a united Europe as a counterweight to the German state.
Indeed, Bavaria became adept at using European Community resources to bolster its own political system.
Integration had its own historical momentum; if and when it goes into reverse, that process will have a counter-momentum.
The argument against European structures depends on hostility to a transfer union that might lead to some redistribution of resources. Why should our money be taken away and given to people in a very different area?
What sort of claim do those people have?
Germans thinking about the likelihood of transfers to southern Europe doubtless recall their country’s reunification after the collapse of communist East Germany in 1989-1990.
There were massive transfers, and national resources were devoted to gigantic infrastructure projects.
That was not enough to halt the hollowing out of the eastern Länder, as many of the ablest and most entrepreneurial people left – an experience that put enormous strain on national solidarity.
Problems of transfers in a large political unit are at the heart of federalism.
The United States’ early history was dominated by a passionate debate about the issue of solidarity.
In 1790, when Alexander Hamilton argued that the new federal government should assume the states’ debts from the War of Independence, he encountered fierce hostility.
The only way to sustain such a new political order, James Madison argued in The Federalist Papers, was to ensure that federal powers were few and limited.
Europe is confronting a similar moment of destiny.
It is now mired in an existential crisis more profound than at any point since 1945.
And, while muddling through is a characteristic response of complex political systems, it is deeply destructive.
If Europe’s political center is widely perceived to be arbitrary and overweening, its authority will be rejected and resisted.
While adopting a new treaty may look like an unwieldy process, ill-suited to managing a fast-moving modern financial crisis, it is the only way to generate legitimacy for the institutions that are needed to address that crisis – in particular to provide reassurance that transfers will not be indefinite and unlimited.
If European integration shifts into reverse, the outcome will not be a series of happy and prosperous nation-states, living in a sort of replica of the 1950’s or 1960’s.
Southern Germans would wonder whether they were not transferring too much to the north’s old industrial rustbelt; northern Italians who support the anti-EU Lega Nord in the self-styled unit of “Padania” would want to escape from the rule of Rome and the south.
Setting the clock back would thus not simply return Europe to the mid-twentieth century.
The small states of the mid-nineteenth century, with no fiscal transfers out of a relatively limited area, might be recreated.
But the dynamic might go further: the German territories had around 350 independent political entities in the mid-eighteenth century, and more than 3,000 before the middle of the seventeenth century.
Watch out, Trans-Dniestr.

Saudi Arabia’s Old Regime Grows Older
LONDON – The contrast between the deaths, within two days of each other, of Libya’s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz is one of terminal buffoonery versus decadent gerontocracy.
And their demise is likely to lead to very different outcomes: liberation for the Libyans and stagnation for the Saudis.
But the death of Sultan, at 86, marks the beginning of a critical period of domestic and foreign uncertainty for the Kingdom.
After all, Sultan’s half-brother, King Abdullah, 87, is still hospitalized in Riyadh, following a major operation last month.
The regime is aging and ailing, and is perceived by the population as being on life support.
Meanwhile, the succession is still being argued.
Sultan’s death is the first time that the burial of a Saudi royal has been delayed to give the ruling family time to decide on the next in line – a sign of internal discord (and concord on the continuation of dynastic rule).
The Saudi regime’s stability now depends on its ability to maintain unity and establish clarity in its system of succession.
With the Crown Prince’s death, schisms are particularly threatening to the Kingdom’s stability (and that of oil exports), because the ruling Al Saud have swelled to 22,000 members, which has given rise to factional clashes among increasingly numerous claimants to power.
Sultan had already been dead – politically, that is – for the last three years; indeed, since June 2011, when he left for New York for medical treatment, young Saudis speculated on numerous Web sites that this was also literally the case.
Abdullah’s octogenarian line of successors recalls the final years of the Soviet Union, when one infirm leader after another succeeded to power for a brief period of inert rule.
Many Saudi subjects feel the same pattern of continuous uncertainty and torpor.
Making matters worse, the rule of succession is ambiguous.
After Abdullah succeeded his brother Fahd, who ruled for 23 years until his death in 2005, he created an Allegiance Council, an ambiguous and mysterious family body that resembled the Vatican’s College of Cardinals.
But here, restrictions are not based entirely on age, but on family bloodlines.
The Council included the surviving royal princes of the 43 sons of Ibn Saud, the Kingdom’s founder, and the sons of their deceased brothers – for example, the late King Faisal’s brood.
But, as Sultan’s health deteriorated, Abdullah bypassed his own creation and appointed Prince Naif, the interior minister, as a second deputy.
In other words, Naif will be anointed Crown Prince.
But, befitting this increasingly exsanguinous imperium, Naif, 82, is known to suffer from leukemia.
Sultan’s fortune is estimated at $270 billion, which he distributed between his sons prior to his death in order to shore up their political position in the competitive princely arena.
The reality is that every senior prince has placed his favorite sons in important positions in the Kingdom.
Sultan secured the defense ministry for his son Khaled, and brought back Khaled’s notorious brother, Bandar to head the Intelligence Security Council.
Abdullah guaranteed his son Mitaeb’s position as head of the National Guard.
The new Crown Prince-in-waiting, Naif, has established his son Mohammed as the next interior minister.
In short, despite Abdullah’s innovations in the succession process, it is an open secret that nothing guarantees a transition to a younger generation of leaders – or that an effective ruler will emerge.
The story of the Al Saud’s succession struggle is no longer whispered behind closed doors.
The Internet has opened a window on all of the royal family’s plots, ambitions, and double-dealings.
The Al Saud resembles a family business, established in 1932.
Ibn Saud managed to conquer and unite the vast territory of the Arabian Peninsula, give it his family name, and alienate, divide, and control his cousins and brothers in order to establish a clear and undisputed line of succession through his sons.
After Ibn Saud’s death, his sons, though never entirely united, maintained enough coherence to keep the store running.
That is no longer true of the thousands of princes that they produced.
As the older generation dies off, the new generation has fallen to fighting in front of the customers.
Indeed, with the ratio of royals to commoners now at one to a thousand (compared to one to five million in the United Kingdom), the challenge of managing princely privileges, salaries, and demand for jobs has never been more intense.
Royal perks include lifetime sinecures and domination of the civil service, which enable the princes to award contracts and receive commissions on top of their salaries.
So the Saudi regime is divided, its legitimacy is questioned, and sectarian tensions are growing.
Moreover, while oil-export revenue is booming, the neighborhood is in revolutionary flames.
In the short term, the iron-fisted Naif, as Crown Prince, will push the Kingdom into greater repression, in part by strengthening the hardline Wahhabi clerics’ place in the country’s power nexus.
Magnificent sums of money, backed by Wahhabi dogma, will be deployed to ensure popular submission and silence.
Whereas Abdullah at least talked about reform (though with no real consequences), Naif can barely bring himself to utter the word.
Denial remains the Saudi rulers’ dominant mindset.
The royals believe that custodianship of Islam’s holy places gives them a special status in the Arab world, and that no revolution can touch them.
And, if anyone tries, they will follow Naif’s counsel: “What we took by the sword we will hold by the sword.”
Throughout the region, newly mobilized (and thus empowered) Arab youth are trying to move their countries towards reform and liberalization.
Saudi Arabia, unfortunately, is moving in the opposite direction.

The G-20’s Empty Gestures
CAMBRIDGE – The world’s 20 most important finance ministers and 20 most important central bankers traveled to Washington this month from every part of the globe to accomplish, predictably, exactly nothing.
The subject of the G-20’s recent meeting was “global imbalances.”
According to the communiqué issued by the group, the meeting focused on developing a procedure for identifying which G-20 countries have “persistently large imbalances” and why they have them.
This delicate analytical task was assigned to the International Monetary Fund, which is to complete its work before the ministers’ next meeting in October.
It hardly takes a team of IMF economists to answer these questions.
Anyone who has taken a first-year undergraduate course in economics would have no difficulty in identifying the countries with the largest trade surpluses and deficits.
The United States wins first prize with a trade deficit of more than $650 billion in the most recent 12 months.
No other country comes close enough to be awarded second prize.
The broader current-account indicator (which includes trade in services and net investment income) confirms America’s leading role: its external deficit is nearly $500 billion.
No other country has more than a $100 billion current-account deficit.
Even if we look at current-account deficits relative to countries’ GDP, America’s 3.3% ratio exceeds that of almost every other economy.
The three countries with larger deficit-to-GDP ratios have a combined deficit of less than $70 billion – not enough to warrant the G-20’s attention.
The country with the largest current-account surplus is, no surprise, China, with a positive balance of more than $300 billion.
Japan and Germany are the only other countries whose current-account surpluses exceed $100 billion.
China’s current-account surplus is 4% of its GDP.
Several oil producers have larger relative current-account surpluses that, combined, exceed China’s in absolute terms.
And there are several other European and Asian countries with higher relative current-account surpluses that together exceed that of China.
But the G-20’s decision to focus only on member countries that account for more than 5% of its combined GDP will exclude these smaller countries from the spotlight.
Only China and the US, and perhaps Germany and Japan, will be at center stage.
So much for the not-so-difficult task of identifying the countries with big imbalances.
But what about the causes of those imbalances?
Every student of economics knows that a country’s current-account deficit is the difference between its national investment (in business equipment, structures, and inventories) and its national saving (by households, businesses, and government).
That is not a theory or an empirical regularity.
It is an implication of the national income-accounting definitions.
The US has an enormous current-account deficit because the federal government’s dissaving (i.e., the fiscal deficit) drags down America’s overall national saving.
And the reverse is true for the Chinese, German, and Japanese current-account surpluses.
In each of those countries, the level of national saving exceeds domestic investment, leaving output to be exported and funds to be loaned abroad.
So the policy actions needed to reduce the trade and current-account imbalances are clear enough.
The US must raise its national saving rate by shrinking its budget deficit, which currently stands at nearly 10% of GDP.
Fortunately, the desirability of doing so is now clear to every policymaker in Washington and to most of the American public.
It will begin to happen as the massive “fiscal stimulus” enacted in 2009 comes to an end, the political process begins to deliver spending cuts, and economic growth yields more tax revenue.
When President Barack Obama attends the G-20’s summit of heads of state in Cannes in November, he will no doubt agree to further reductions in the US budget deficit.
But that will be an empty promise: the US president has far less control over legislation than government heads in parliamentary democracies like Britain or in countries like China.
And Obama’s power is even more limited now that his Democratic Party controls only one house of the US Congress.
The history of previous summits suggests that the president will promise in Cannes only what he has already proposed at home.
The G-20 ministers and central bankers are, of course, in no position to change the behavior of either the US or China, whose recently adopted five-year plan makes clear that it will reduce national saving by increasing consumer spending and raising government outlays for services like health care.
In other words, China will, for its own domestic reasons, reduce its current-account surplus.
The same kind of national self-interest that is driving the Chinese to stimulate domestic spending was at work when the G-20 leaders met in London in April 2009 and agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies.
That agreement was easy to achieve, since it was in each country’s interest to expand demand.
The G-20 only ratified what was going to happen anyway.
But the G-20 leaders and finance ministers nonetheless now point with pride to what they “accomplished” in London.
The same is likely to happen over the next few years as the US reduces its fiscal deficit and thereby shrinks its current-account deficit while China reduces its national saving and thereby shrinks its current-account surplus.
The leaders of the G-20 will no doubt claim credit for this achievement.
Perhaps that is why they like to meet.

Regulate the Carry Trade
PRINCETON – During the early years of the global financial crisis, exchange rates were the least interesting part of the macroeconomic debate.
A French proposal in 2011 for a sweeping reform of the international monetary regime went nowhere.
Today, the subject has become the focus of intense anxiety – and with good reason.
Currency wars are a reminder of the fragility of the process of globalization.
As one part of that process begins to appear unacceptably painful, demand for political intervention rises, and the entire system risks beginning to unravel.
The expectation that interest rates in the United States will rise is driving up the value of the dollar, even as monetary easing in Japan and Europe is pushing down the yen and the euro.
Over the last year, the euro has lost more than a fifth of its value relative to the dollar, and there is no sign that the trend will reverse anytime soon.
The euro’s depreciation has been greeted with delight by Europe’s business leaders.
But in the US, where the dollar’s gains are threatening to choke off economic recovery, officials at the Federal Reserve are expressing signs of concern.
The swing in exchange rates could have an impact that extends far beyond the short-term rebalancing of the global marketplace.
US President Barack Obama is negotiating with Asian countries over the Trans-Pacific Partnership and with Europe over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
The dollar’s rapid rise will play into the hands of his protectionist critics in a hostile and increasingly obstructionist Congress.
Indeed, surges in the dollar’s value have long coincided with increased political pressure for trade protectionism.
After all, the most obvious way to compensate for the apparent overvaluation of a country’s currency is by imposing import restrictions.
In the mid-1980s, the dollar’s appreciating exchange rate undermined US competitiveness, inaugurating a period of rapid and painful deindustrialization.
At that time, the major competitive threat was from Japan, and American politicians faced intense pressure to respond.
In 1985, the US Senate unanimously approved a resolution condemning Japan’s unfair trade practices and called on President Ronald Reagan to act to curb imports.
This was followed by a bill proposing a special levy on countries running large bilateral trade surpluses with the US.
If anything, today’s exchange-rate swings are likely to be more extreme, and to last longer, than the surge in the dollar’s value in the 1980s or the volatility of the 1930s, when, in the aftermath of the financial crash that triggered the Great Depression, countries competed to devalue their currencies.
The problem is what is known as the carry trade, a common financial strategy in which an investor borrows money in a currency subject to a low interest rate in order to buy assets in a currency subject to a higher rate.
The interest-rate differential, often combined with high amounts of leverage, provides a profit when the loans are paid off.
When exchange rates are stable and predictable, the carry trade is relatively safe.
But this is rarely the case.
For starters, the practice has the tendency to push exchange rates further apart, as investors sell the currency in which they borrowed to make their purchases.
This creates an incentive to take on more debt, because the real value of the loan is likely to be lower when the time comes to repay it.
The large corporate borrowers engaged in the carry trade consider themselves sophisticated investors, capable of predicting when exchange rates are about to reverse.
Unfortunately, this only increases the risk, boosting the possibility of a sudden reversal as money pours back into the borrowed currency in an attempt to repay loans before the exchange rate soars to loss-generating levels.
And hedging against such a reversal merely builds up risk elsewhere in the international financial system.
The dangers are very real.
In the 1980s, governments responded to large exchange-rate swings through active intervention, intentionally driving the dollar’s value down in 1985, only to try to stabilize it 18 months later.
These initiatives served a political purpose – holding off the protectionists.
But they also caused serious financial instability, contributing to a major stock-market crash in October 1987.
There is one historical precedent that could serve as a model, should we be able to muster the political will to consider it.
In the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes championed limits on the movement of capital in order to blunt the more damaging consequences of globalization.
The equivalent today would be to introduce regulations on the carry trade.
Policymakers would do well to consider this option – before it is too late.

The Education Antidote to Radicalization
DUBAI – No visitor to the Middle East can avoid noticing the yawning gap between the educational, entrepreneurial, and occupational aspirations of the region’s young people and the harsh reality that deprives so many of them of a positive future.
Indeed, in the Middle East, half of those aged 18-25 are either unemployed or underemployed.
Aggravating this situation is the global refugee crisis, which has displaced some 30 million children, six million from Syria alone, very few of whom are likely to return home during their school-age years.
It should come as no surprise that the group known in the region as Daesh (the Islamic State) believes that it can find fertile ground for recruitment in this vast population of dispossessed and disaffected young people.
Daesh propagandists are misusing social media in the way that their extremist predecessors and contemporaries have sometimes misused mosques – as a forum for radicalization.
The group consistently posts content that challenges the possibility of coexistence between Islam and the West and calls young people to jihad.
The grotesquely violent videos that Daesh produces have shock appeal.
But what really attracts disaffected young people is the invitation to be part of something that seems larger than themselves and the societies in which they live.
Shiraz Maher of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) at King’s College London identifies a common thread of sentiment among recruits: “righteous indignation, defiance, a sense of persecution, and a refusal to conform.”
As a recent Quilliam Foundation report concludes, Daesh plays on the youthful desire to be part of something worthwhile; it is the organization’s utopian appeal that is most alluring to new recruits.
Given this, few would disagree that we find ourselves in a generational battle for hearts and minds that cannot be won by military means alone.
Hard power can eliminate Daesh’s hardcore leaders. But we will need more than that to convince nearly 200 million young Muslims that extremism is, quite literally, a dead end.
There are many examples of under-the-radar operations working to counter extremism across the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East: children’s magazines in Pakistan, videos aimed at teenagers in North Africa, radio stations in the Middle East, and books and publications opposing Al Qaeda.
They can help to expose the truth about life in Daesh – that it is brutal, corrupt, and prone to internal purges – in several ways, including by drawing attention to defections.
As a 2014 report states, “[the very existence of defectors] shatters the image of unity and determination that [the group] seeks to convey.”
But we must be more ambitious if we are to win the war of ideas, sustaining the cultural space that Daesh calls the “the grey zone,” which it longs to destroy. It is a space in which Muslims and non-Muslims can coexist, discover their shared values, and cooperate.
Peter Neumann, the director of the ICSR, has proposed a YouTube contest for videos that explain the failings of Daesh.
“You would receive 5,000 videos in no time,” he says. “Four thousand are junk, but 1,000 of them are effective – 1,000 videos against [Daesh] propaganda.”
The best long-term tool for countering extremism, however, is education.
In Jaffa, Israel, a school run by the Church of Scotland teaches the virtues of tolerance to Muslim, Jewish, and Christian children.
Throughout Lebanon, a common school curriculum championing religious diversity – including the “refusal of any radicalism and religious or sectarian seclusion” – is being taught to Sunni, Shia, and Christian children starting at the age of nine.
The country has also introduced double shifts in its school system to accommodate some 200,000 Syrian refugee children.
If troubled Lebanon, wracked by sectarian violence and religious divides, can champion coexistence and provide Syrian refugees with a chance to study, there is no reason other countries in the region should not follow its example.
The choice could not be clearer.
We can stand by and watch a new generation of web-savvy Muslim youth be deluged with false claims that Islam cannot coexist with Western values.
Or we can recognize that the young people of the Middle East and the rest of the Muslim world share the aspirations of young people in every other part of the world.
All the evidence indicates that the region’s young people want education, employment, and the chance to make the most of their talents.
Our resolution for 2016 should be to make that happen.

Ending the War of Attrition in Ukraine
NEW YORK – Wars often erupt and persist because of the two sides’ miscalculations regarding their relative power.
In the case of Ukraine, Russia blundered badly by underestimating the resolve of Ukrainians to fight and the effectiveness of NATO-supplied weaponry.
Yet Ukraine and NATO are also overestimating their capacity to defeat Russia on the battlefield.
The result is a war of attrition that each side believes it will win, but that both sides will lose.
Ukraine should intensify the search for a negotiated peace of the type that was on the table in late March, but which it then abandoned following evidence of Russian atrocities in Bucha – and perhaps owing to changing perceptions of its military prospects.
The peace terms under discussion in late March called for Ukraine’s neutrality, backed by security guarantees and a timeline to address contentious issues such as the status of Crimea and the Donbas.
Russian and Ukrainian negotiators stated that there was progress in the negotiations, as did the Turkish mediators.
The negotiations then collapsed after the reports from Bucha, with Ukraine’s negotiator stating that, “Ukrainian society is now much more negative about any negotiation concept that concerns the Russian Federation.”
But the case for negotiations remains urgent and overwhelming.
The alternative is not Ukraine’s victory but a devastating war of attrition.
To reach an agreement, both sides need to recalibrate their expectations.
When Russia attacked Ukraine, it clearly expected a quick and easy victory.
Russia vastly underestimated the upgrading of the Ukraine military following years of US, British, and other military support and training since 2014.
Moreover, Russia underestimated the extent to which NATO military technology would counter Russia’s greater number of troops.
No doubt, Russia’s greatest error was to assume that the Ukrainians would not fight – or perhaps even switch sides.
Yet now Ukraine and its Western supporters are overestimating the chances of defeating Russia on the battlefield.
The idea that the Russian army is about to collapse is wishful thinking.
Russia has the military capacity to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure (such as the rail lines now under attack) and to win and hold territory in the Donbas region and on the Black Sea coast.
Ukrainians are fighting resolutely, but it is highly unlikely that they can force a Russian defeat.
Nor can Western financial sanctions, which are far less sweeping and effective than the governments that imposed them acknowledge.
US sanctions against Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, and others have not changed the politics of those regimes, and the sanctions against Russia are already falling far short of the hype with which they were introduced.
Excluding Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system was not the “nuclear option” that many claimed.
According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia’s economy will contract by around 8.5% in 2022 – bad but hardly catastrophic.
Moreover, the sanctions are creating serious economic consequences for the United States and especially Europe.
US inflation is at a 40-year high and is likely to persist because of the trillions of dollars of liquidity that had been created by the Federal Reserve in recent years.
At the same time, the US and European economies are slowing, perhaps even contracting, as supply-chain disruptions proliferate.
US President Joe Biden’s domestic political position is weak and likely to weaken further as economic difficulties mount in the coming months.
Public support for the war will also likely diminish as the economy sours.
The Republican Party is split over the war, with the Trump faction not much interested in confronting Russia over Ukraine.
The Democrats, too, will increasingly resent the stagflation that is likely to cost the party its majority in one or both houses of Congress in the November midterm elections.
The adverse economic fallout from the war and sanctions regime will also reach dire proportions in dozens of developing countries that depend on food and energy imports.
Economic dislocations in these countries will lead to urgent calls worldwide to end the war and sanctions regime.
In the meantime, Ukraine continues to suffer grievously in terms of deaths, dislocation, and destruction.
The IMF now forecasts a 35% contraction of Ukraine’s economy in 2022, reflecting the brutal destruction of housing, factories, rail stock, energy storage and transmission capacity, and other vital infrastructure.
Most dangerous of all, as long as the war continues, the risk of nuclear escalation is real.
If Russia’s conventional forces were actually to be pushed toward defeat, as the US is now seeking, Russia might well counter with tactical nuclear weapons.
A US or Russian aircraft could be shot down by the other side as they scramble over the Black Sea, which in turn could lead to direct military conflict.
Media reports that the US has covert forces on the ground, and the US intelligence community’s disclosure that it helped Ukraine kill Russian generals and sink Russia’s Black Sea flagship, underscore the danger.
The reality of the nuclear threat means that both sides should never forgo the possibility of negotiations.
That is the central lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which took place 60 years ago this coming October.
President John F. Kennedy saved the world then by negotiating an end to the crisis – agreeing that the US would never again invade Cuba and that the US would remove its missiles from Turkey in exchange for the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles from Cuba.
That was not giving in to Soviet nuclear blackmail. That was Kennedy wisely avoiding Armageddon.
It is still possible to establish peace in Ukraine based on the parameters that were on the table at the end of March: neutrality, security guarantees, a framework for addressing Crimea and the Donbas, and Russian withdrawal.
This remains the only realistic and safe course for Ukraine, Russia, and the world.
The world would rally to such an agreement, and, for its own survival and well-being, so should Ukraine.

Instability from Rigidity
Everyone wants economic stability, and many are reluctant to abandon today what gave them stability yesterday.
But trying to obtain stability from rigidity is illusory.
The stability of the international financial system today depends on the willingness of countries with rigid exchange rates to allow greater flexibility.
In the aftermath of the international financial crisis of 1997-1998, many emerging markets found themselves – through currency depreciation, rapid productivity gains, or both – highly competitive.
Countries that ran significant current-account surpluses, built up large reserves, and fixed (or heavily managed) their exchange rates in order to support the first two objectives appeared to secure external stability.
The irony is that the crisis of 1997-1998 was one in which a particular system of exchange-rate pegs failed when capital flowed out.
Yet, in many ways, accumulating reserves worked better than anyone could have imagined – countries found that they could withstand considerable shocks and growth was impressive both domestically and globally.
So, within a few years, many countries concluded that their pegs could work fine if supported by large enough war chests of official reserves.
A new type of order emerged in the world’s exchange rate system.
There were, of course, some less desirable spillover effects on others.
If a considerable fraction of the world economy wants to run a current-account surplus (by 2006, this included much of emerging Asia, most oil exporters, and Japan), an equal share of the world economy must run a deficit.
In the period after 1998, the United States provided almost the entire required deficit.
As long as US assets were attractive to residents of surplus countries (or there was an acceptable chain of investments from surplus countries that ended in the US), these accumulations of reserves were sustainable.
The IMF worried a great deal about what would happen when this chain broke – and the eventual break was, of course, more a matter of arithmetic than economics.
The US current-account deficit can persist above roughly 3% of GDP only if unrealistic assumptions are made about the share of US assets that the rest of the world is willing to hold.
The policy plans announced by China, the euro area, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the US in the spring of 2007 – in the context of the IMF’s Multilateral Consultation on global imbalances – represent the international community’s response to the rising risks.
The US is to reduce its deficit, with the surplus countries proposing sensible steps to bring down their surpluses in ways that support global growth.
The sense of urgency in these discussions has increased in recent months, as the global situation has grown more complex.
Specifically, problems in the US housing sector have, since summer, undermined confidence in securitized assets.
The net result has been to shift global portfolio preferences in ways that have affected some exchange rates significantly.
The dollar has depreciated in a way that helps global adjustment and fortunately does not disrupt the US government securities market; long-term rates are in fact down from July, so adjustment has been “orderly.”
Yet the pattern of exchange-rate movements in the rest of the world has been largely unrelated to existing current-account positions.
In fact, currencies of surplus countries with heavily managed exchange rates have actually depreciated in real effective terms since the summer, creating inflationary pressure and frustrating global adjustment.
This has also shifted the burden of adjustment disproportionately onto countries with floating currencies, such as the euro and the Canadian and Australian dollar.
The lack of adjustment of surplus countries with inflexible exchange rate-regimes means that as the US deficit falls, a counterbalancing deficit develops elsewhere in the world – along with real effective exchange rate appreciation.
Knowing what to do in this increasingly complex and volatile situation is the easy part: look at the Multilateral Consultation policy plans and “just do it.”
As the US Treasury’s recent semiannual report to America’s Congress noted, for China these plans are to “rebalance its economy: boosting domestic demand and consumption-led growth; reforming its financial system; and achieving greater flexibility in its exchange-rate regime.
Indeed, rebalancing the pattern of growth is a central economic goal of China’s leadership.”
But expanding demand and allowing real effective exchange rate appreciation in China will not be enough if other countries do not do their part.
Oil exporters must increase fiscal spending further; Japan and the Euro area must trigger higher growth through structural reforms; and the US must implement concrete measures to sustain higher savings.
This would help maintain confidence that the adjustment process will remain orderly and free of new global imbalances or protectionism.
Implementing the policy commitments from the multilateral consultation is also needed to avoid a loss of confidence in the dollar.
The risks to global growth will increase as long as adjustment remains uneven.
The politics is not so simple, but we need cooperation between countries to reduce these risks, and we need it now.

Who’s Winning the Middle East’s Cold War?
LONDON – A cold war is taking place in a very hot place.
A key component of the sectarian competition between Shia and Sunni Islam in the Middle East is geopolitical, with Iran facing off against Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies in a struggle for regional dominance.
As with the original Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, the conflict does not involve direct military confrontation between the main rivals, at least not yet.
It is being fought diplomatically, ideologically, and economically – especially in the oil markets – and through proxy wars, such as the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.
There are few problems in the wider Middle East that cannot be traced back to the power rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
For the moment, the Iranians seem to be riding high.
Following Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s decision to agree to an international deal limiting Iran’s nuclear capability to peaceful purposes, Western sanctions have been all but removed.
Now that it is once again acceptable to do business with Iran, its ailing economy is set for a rebound.
Meanwhile, Iran’s creeping de facto annexation of parts of Iraq – astonishingly, with American acceptance – continues because no one except the so-called “Islamic State” has the stomach to stand up to it.
Iran also has an overwhelming manpower advantage, with a population of an estimated 77 million, compared to Saudi Arabia’s 28 million.
And while its army is far less well equipped than its rival’s, it is much larger.
Moreover, Iran’s main Arab ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been given a reprieve as the conflict in his country drags on without conclusion.
This has left the Saudis feeling abandoned and vulnerable.
They believe that their great traditional ally, the US, betrayed them by concluding the nuclear deal with Iran.
Meanwhile, they fear that the chaos in neighboring Iraq has exposed them to chronic strategic risks.
The Saudis are also recoiling under a barrage of criticism of their Wahhabi brand of Islam, which is widely blamed for incubating extremism and inspiring terrorism.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s human rights record – including the denial of elementary rights for women – is under constant scrutiny.
Against this background, the Kingdom is taking the fight to its enemies.
King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is the country’s above-the-fray ruler, but his son, Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, currently wields much of the power.
As Minister of Defense, Mohammad has continued the Saudi policy of backing anti-Assad rebels in Syria, in concert with Turkey, while unleashing a war on pro-Iranian tribesmen in Yemen (at an enormous humanitarian cost).
He has also backed, if not instigated, an increase in domestic repression, and has launched an economic offensive against Iran – the consequences of which have been seen, until recently, in plunging global oil prices.
In early May, Saudi Arabia’s longstanding oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, was replaced by Khalid al-Falih, an ally of Mohammad’s.
The reshuffle is an indication of Mohammad’s determination to use oil prices as a weapon against Iran and its ally, Russia.
As the world’s swing producer, with boundless reserves of cheaply extractable oil, Saudi Arabia can flood or throttle the market at will.
And for now, the Saudis are flooding the market.
They are seeking to rein in Iran and Russia, both of which need higher oil prices to sustain economic growth.
And they are hoping to bankrupt the US shale-oil producers that have reduced America’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
As Mohammad recently declared, the Kingdom doesn’t care about oil prices; “$30 or $70 – they are all the same to us.” Iran and Russia, by contrast, need a barrel of oil to be worth at least $70.
The US oil industry has proved more adaptable and resilient than expected; cheaper shale fields have opened even as old ones have closed.
But the Saudi oil offensive has helped convince Iran and Russia to drag Assad, kicking and screaming, to the negotiating table.
Mohammad’s new economic plan, Vision 2030, unveiled in May, is another front in the economic war, designed to show that Saudi Arabia is immune to the domestic economic pressures afflicting Iran and Russia.
The plan calls for economic diversification and envisages the establishment of a huge sovereign wealth fund to cushion the impact of lower oil revenues that the ruling class has traditionally used to purchase social peace.
The Saudi strategy is not without its costs.
Gulf remittances of around $10 billion a year to Egypt (itself under increasing economic pressure and a dizzying fall in tourist receipts after recent terrorist attacks) have been scaled back to around $3 billion.
And funding to Lebanon has been cut almost completely.
And yet the long-term outcome of this cold war is not hard to predict.
Iran and Russia can never be more than foothold powers in the Arab world.
The Shia might be able to maintain influence in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon (through Hezbollah), but they will be unable to compete more broadly.
Some 90% of Arabs are Sunni Muslims, and thus potential Saudi allies.
The Saudis can afford to be more mature, and less suspicious than they have been.
The US should take steps to reassure them – while never easing up pressure to improve human rights and implement political and economic reforms.

A Misaligned Euro?
CAMBRIDGE: Caught by rising inflation from oil prices and a soaring dollar, the European Central Bank (ECB) has raised interest rates yet another notch.
More is to come.
Growth is wonderful; inflation is terrible; a central bank cannot avoid choosing: it must restore price stability even if that means sacrificing growth.
This is what lies ahead, unless there is sudden relief from an upturn in the euro.
But is it realistic to expect a rally from a currency that has been under siege since its birth?
At its introduction the euro reached impressive heights, like a high-tech IPO.
But the IPO soon sunk miserably.
Since its introduction, the euro has fallen further from its peak then even the Nasdaq in the high-tech sell-off of earlier this year.
Like the Nasdaq’s high-tech high-flyers, the nagging questions about the euro are these: what is its fundamental value?
Is there a fundamental misalignment of the euro with other currencies (most notably the dollar) and how long might this last?
It is commonly assumed (but nobody takes big bets) that the Nasdaq still carries major downside risks while the euro, sooner or later, must return to normality, whatever that means.
Could the opposite happen?
A recent study by the IMF reports on “equilibrium” exchange rates derived from models of long run factors in currency valuations.
The equilibrium rates are reported in the accompanying table and so are today’s actual rates.
According to these IMF theoretical equilibrium rates, the euro is grossly misaligned: 30% underpriced against the dollar, 18% against the Yen!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Actual IMF Equilibrium Rate
Dollar/Euro ($/_) 0.88 1.26
Yen/Euro (-/_) 93.1 113.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In judging whether these theoretical values foreshadow a big euro realignment, lets see what causes them.
First and most importantly, these equilibrium rates are based on a theoretical model where long run current account balances tend toward zero.
Under this scenario, any country that runs persistent, large current account balances must look forward to a hard landing and a correction in the value of its currency.
No country can borrow forever or at least at very high rates.
But do current account constraints apply to major, financially stable countries?
Canada has run current account deficits for all but three of the last 50 years; the US has done the same for 30 years.
So long as a borrowing country is stable and attractive, a major reversal due to the current account balance will not be forced by the market.
That is America’s story: despite a yawning trade deficit, investment is running high, eagerly financed by the rest of the world; public finance is formidable and inflation insignificant; new economy prospects run unabated and asset markets are revealing that even if there is a US bubble, it is unlikely to burst as violently as in Japan a decade ago.
In such an environment, long run equilibrium rate models are pretty useless as guides to short or even medium term exchange rate developments.
The second limitation of long run models is this: they are estimated from history and so make no allowance for dramatic changes in the supply side or financial environment.
Japan, for example, is in the grip of a growth crisis and public finance disaster - not the usual companions of an appreciating currency.
On the dollar/euro front, the US has embarked on a high productivity trend unmatched anywhere; never mind the current account, the upswing in American productivity (combined with financial stability) is the dominant feature no matter the current account.
The counterpart of here, because exchange rates always ride on differential performance, is a continued poor supply side performance in Europe and Japan’s ongoing and pervasive economic distress.
There is a third reason why estimates of long run equilibrium with current account balance may be of little predictive value.
Do Europe and Japan really want to see the US achieve an external balance?
Europe and Japan, indeed the whole emerging economy world, are living off America’s trade deficits.
They keep the world growing!
Were there a risk to the continued funding of these deficits by the private sector, the ECB and the Bank of Japan would step in to buy all the dollars that their private sectors had shunned.
There is precedent for this: whenever the dollar weakens, foreign central banks are eager to help.
As John Connally, President Nixon’s Treasury Secretary of 30 years ago, said: “the dollar is our money and their problem.”
The chance of seeing exchange rates near the IMF values any time soon is slim.
Yes, the euro can tend toward dollar parity.
But it is also plausible that lack of support for the euro and the ongoing US miracle will see the euro sink to exceptionally low levels of near .80 and even less.
For the time being, investors will continue to think of the euro as a problem just as the ECB does.
The euro IPO crashed because it came at a time when the US economy was flying high.
The European product is going to make it; it will have its day in the sun.
But right now?
It has no chance to shine.

The Moment When America Fell Behind
DENVER – As governments around the world adopt policies to address the immediate economic fallout of COVID-19, they are making decisions that will also determine their countries’ competitiveness for decades to come.
If designed correctly, stimulus and recovery packages can position countries and regions to reap the benefits of the industries of the future.
The European Union is already poised to speed ahead with the European Green Deal.
And China will inevitably build on its pre-pandemic competitive advantages in solar power, electric vehicles (EVs), and batteries.
The United States, on the other hand, is increasingly at risk of being left behind.
The European Green Deal is the perfect model for designing stimulus and recovery packages to create both immediate and long-term economic advantages.
In the short run, its proposed investments would produce many high-paying jobs in clean-energy infrastructure, funding the installation of more wind and solar facilities, EV charging stations, hydrogen production plants, and programs to retrofit buildings for energy efficiency.
Better still, over the long term, all of these investments will result in lower energy costs, more resilient energy systems, and a healthier population – among many other benefits.
The costs of clean-energy technologies have been falling rapidly, following predictable learning curves.
Over time, they will only become cheaper and faster to deploy on a greater scale.
Recognizing these advantages, Europe’s recovery efforts have already allocated billions of euros to build solar farms in Iberia and offshore wind turbines in the North Sea.
European companies such as Vestas, Siemens Gamesa, and others will do all the work.
And these expanded sources of cheap, renewable electricity will then be used to produce the hydrogen molecules that will power heavy industry in the future.
By earmarking €40 billion ($45 billion) for investment in hydrogen infrastructure, the European Green Deal aims to ensure that shipping, steel manufacturing, and other industries can run on clean fuel.
The EU has also set aside recovery funds to install two million electric and hydrogen vehicle charging stations, thereby stimulating demand for EVs that can be built locally by companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, and Renault.
In these and other ways, Europe is taking meaningful steps to catch up with China in green technologies.
Then again, if China were to introduce a stimulus and recovery package modeled after the European Green Deal, it could extend its competitive advantage into other forms of renewable energy, electric mobility, and hydrogen-powered industry.
As in Europe, investment in green infrastructure will produce millions of good jobs in the near term, while reducing or containing air pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions over the long term, even as the Chinese economy grows.
The clean air, quiet streets, and pristine views that became an accidental byproduct of the pandemic lockdown can be made permanent with cleaner forms of energy and transportation.
In the US, by contrast, though the federal government has taken some of the necessary steps to mitigate the short-term collapse of the economy, policymakers have thought little about the future.
That is why many of the dirty industries of the past are being bailed out.
A decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that America would lead the energy future, because it was approaching “energy independence,” owing to massive reserves of shale oil and gas that could now be extracted through hydraulic fracturing (fracking).
But those industries are now in structural decline.
The cost curves are clear: fossil fuels cannot compete with cheaper, more efficient, and clean-energy solutions.
By the same token, EVs will become steadily cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion engines, just as green hydrogen will become the energy of choice for increasingly decarbonized heavy industries.
Watching US President Donald Trump’s administration attempt to rescue jobs in coal mining, I am reminded of my first job after high school, when I worked in a typewriter factory in the south of the Netherlands.
Imagine if the Dutch government had for some reason decided to bail out that factory when personal computers started coming to market in the 1980s and 1990s.
It would have been investing in a museum, not in a viable industry.
While jobs in the fossil-fuel industry will be lost, many more jobs will be created to manufacture wind turbines and batteries, install solar panels, build EVs, retrofit buildings, and so forth.
The world is making the transition to clean energy, and those countries that are betting on the technologies of the past are digging their own economic graves.
Concerted industrial policies to build clean-energy infrastructure will do an enormous amount of good, not just for people and the planet, but also for countries’ economic competitiveness and future prosperity.
Europe and China understand this, and are already on track to become the leaders of the world economy in the coming decades.
They are actively leveraging their recovery packages to hasten that historic shift.
In Europe, especially, future generations will admire today’s leaders for creating jobs, driving down air pollution, and establishing a competitive economic position for decades to come.
In the US, not so much.

Twenty Years After the Wall
BERLIN – Those who witnessed that night 20 years ago in Berlin, or elsewhere in Germany, will never forget what happened – the night the Wall came down.
History in the making is all too often tragic. Only rarely is it capable of irony.
November 9, 1989, was one of those rare moments when irony reigned, because East Germany’s bureaucratic socialism died as it had lived – with a bureaucratic snafu.
The Speaker of the Politburo, Günter Schabowski, had simply misunderstood that body’s decision and, by releasing to the public incorrect information about the lifting of travel restrictions, triggered the fall of the Wall!
Groucho Marx could not have bettered Schabowski that night.
It was Germany’s happiest hour.
Twenty years later, many revolutionary consequences of that night lie behind us. The Soviet Union and its empire quietly disappeared, and with them the Cold War international order.
As the victorious heir to the collapsed Cold War order, the United States stood alone, undisputed, at the peak of its global power.
But, within two decades – following the war in Iraq and financial and economic crisis – the US had squandered that special status.
Arrogance of power and blindness about reality were the two main causes for the decline of the sole remaining superpower.
While most of the blame lies with George W. Bush, numerous negative trends had preceded him. He merely took them to the extreme.
After September11, 2001, the US had a second big chance to use its unique power to reorganize the world.
After this terrible crime, countries – including in the Arab world – were ready to embrace far-reaching steps.
At that moment, peace between Palestinians and Israelis could have been achieved, and thus a new beginning made in the Middle East.
Even a radical about-face in US energy policy, with the introduction of energy taxes, would have been possible under the banner of national security.
The challenge posed by global climate change could have been addressed more effectively that way.
But that opportunity, too, was thrown away.
Europe – and, within it, Germany – were among the big winners of November 9, 1989.
The Continent reunited in liberty: Germany on October 3, 1990; Europe with the great European Union enlargement of May 1, 2004.
The introduction of a common European currency was successful; political integration by means of a constitutional treaty a failure. Since then, the EU has been stagnating, both internally and externally.
Europe has made only insufficient use of its opportunities since 1989 – and could dramatically lose influence in the emerging power structure of the twenty-first century.
In Germany, which largely owes its reunification to its firm roots in the EU and NATO, Europe-weariness is palpable.
The generation ruling in Berlin today increasingly thinks in national rather than European terms.
This was never more obvious than in the deciding days and weeks of the global financial crisis.
Russia, the big loser of 1989, remains two decades later mired in a mix of social and economic depression and political regression and illusion.
Life expectancy continues to decline; investment in infrastructure, research, and education are stunted; the economy is barely able to compete internationally; and the social divide between poor and rich is deepening.
Economically, Russia has turned into a commodity exporter, dependant on the imponderables of the global energy market, while simultaneously dreaming that it can use energy as a tool to revise the post-Soviet order in its neighborhood.
Russia’s elites still largely think in the power categories of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
This constitutes the illusionary and historically regressive element of current Russian policy.
Russia’s desire to reclaim its role as a powerful global player is understandable and legitimate.
But if it turns toward the past in looking for its future, and if it believes it can dispense with investments in the future in favor of shameless personal self-enrichment, it will continue to lose ground.
November 9, 1989, marked not only the end of the Cold War era, but also the beginning of a new wave of globalization.
The real winners of this new world order are the large emerging countries, first and foremost China and India, which increasingly set the pace of global economic and political development.
The G-8 has been dismissed by history as a club of Western industrial nations; its place has been taken by the G-20, which conceals the underlying formula of power distribution within the new world order: the G-2 (China and the US).
All these changes reflect a dramatic transfer of power from West to East, from Europe and America to Asia, which within the next two decades is likely to bring to an end 400 years of Eurocentrism.
The past two decades also have seen the world begin to reach its ecological limits.
The majority of humanity has sought since November 9, 1989, to achieve Western living standards at all costs, overstretching our planet’s climate and ecosystems.
The years since the Berlin Wall came down have been rich in dramatic change, but the real era of upheaval lies ahead.
Global warming is only the tip of the iceberg towards which we are moving, knowingly, with eyes wide open.
What matters now is that states act globally and in unison.
Twenty years after Berlin, Copenhagen is calling.

Crime and Punishment, Refugee Style
The horrible murder of Giovanna Reggiani that took place near a Romanian refugee camp in the suburb of Tor di Quinto in Rome shocked both Italy and Romania.
The case gained significance by adding fuel to the fiery public debates now underway not only in Italy but across Europe on the status of refugees and foreign residents.
Some Italians responded violently; some Italian and Romanian politicians, eager to offer quick and tough solutions, made scandalous statements that echoed the xenophobic and totalitarian slogans of the past.
We are encountering, not without irony, a kind of grotesque reverse of the “national pride” seen when cultural and sporting stars are appropriated by the state and presented as part of the collective patrimony.
Although the murder was an individual crime, to compound the tragedy of a crime through measures that target an entire minority is irresponsible, and will have grave moral and social consequences not only for the unjustly punished but also for the punishers.
No minority is, after all, homogenous, which was demonstrated by the fact that the person who alerted the police was a compatriot of the killer and from the same camp of refugees.
Collective punishment also means not only a type of amnesia by Italians and Romanians about what happened under fascism, nazism, communism, but also for their own national histories.
Italians, after all, migrated not only from Italy’s south to its north, but also to other countries looking for a better life.
They, too, know what it is like to be a refugee, an exile, a stranger.
Romania, for its part, has a history not at all admirable in regard to it its “Roma” minority, whose shortcomings and deeds always attract blame but never any real action by the state to improve their condition.
The Roma minority first appeared in Romania in the 14th century, but only in 1856 was its slavery abolished!
Romanian society nowadays is dealing with the consequences of decades of terror and lies, of demagogy and poverty that scarred several generations.
These wounds cannot be instantly healed.
Communism’s fall unleashed a huge surge of human energy, but this started with a bizarre and cynical transfer of privileges and assets within the old “nomenklatura,” and with a new general Darwinian struggle.
Although economic progress is visible across Romania, and a gradual renewal of a civic conscience through the arrival of democracy has appeared, Romania’s burlesque of a political life – despite its European Union membership – shows how persistent its bad old habits of duplicity, inconsistency, fatalism, inertia, and corruption are.
Corruption, indeed, now seems to be the society’s engine.
There remain in Romania today disadvantaged and neglected groups who are pushed to society’s sordid margins.
The Roma population, indeed, has 41% seasonal workers, 33.5 % lack any professional skills, 38.7 % are illiterate.
This is not only a Romanian problem, but has become a problem for all of Europe.
Nicolae Romulus Mailat, the young man of 25 accused of Giovanna Reggianni’s murder, had been interned at age 14 in a school for re-education.
He was later condemned again for theft, but was pardoned a year before arriving in Italy.
Was poverty the cause of his juvenile offenses in Romania and his crime in Italy?
In Dostoievski’s great novel Crime and Punishment , Raskolnikov is pushed to committing his crime not only by his nihilism and rebelliousness, but also by poverty.
His social identity is not the same as Mailat’s, his spiritual “entity” is drastically different, but his double crime is no less abominable.
For now, there is no reason to hope that Mailat will find through his crime a new start towards salvation through suffering and spiritual renewal.
But perhaps we should hear again the words of one of Raskolnikov’s interlocutors when he speaks about the “disgusting Sodome” in which he wanders and says that poverty is not a vice, but misery.
In poverty one still keeps a kind of “innate noble sentiment,” while in misery moral collapse is inherent and disastrous.
Mailat sought escape from his Romanian misery and his Romanian past, but could not imagine that he would find in an Italian refugee camp as much misery as before; that the image in the mirror of his daily new life would be that of a killer.
People who know the frightening neighborhood of Tor di Quinto, where Giovanna Reggiani was killed have harsh words to say about the neglect and indifference of Rome’s city government.
This isn’t, of course, an excuse for this crime or for any crime, but it cannot be ignored.
Although we cannot expect a miraculous reincarnation of the criminal Mailat, we can and must ask for a radical review of the situation that marginalized people like him face.
That review must be done not only by Romanian and Italian states, but by the Roma community in Romania and Italy and also by the European community itself.
For the perpetrator is a member of all these communities.
We hear voices now who are exasperated by the EU’s enlargement and the social tensions it provoked.
Increased migration is, indeed, a daily fact in our centrifugal and global modernity, but it isn’t only a negative one.
The free movement of people doesn’t only mean more social conflict and criminality. It also means a gradual and beneficial cohabitation that began immediately after WWII as a common effort to help out the defeated countries and enhance their chances for democracy and prosperity.
When I visited Barcelona and Madrid last year, I was delighted to receive enthusiastic news about the successes of the growing Romanian community in these cities.
Some Romanian refugees were already candidates for the local elections, praised for their hard work and honesty.
It will happen, I hope, also in other places and not only with Romanians but with all the people ready to face the provocations of our time.
For these are examples not only of individual success, but are victories for the community as well.
Europe deserves to prove that it is a real community, one diverse, democratic, spiritual, free, and prosperous.

Fighting Ebola on All Fronts
PARIS – Judging by the media coverage in the United States and Europe of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, one might conclude that conditions in the affected countries are gradually improving.
But, though the epidemic is no longer a front-page story, the virus is far from being contained.
On the contrary, it remains a serious global health threat.
I recently traveled to Conakry, the capital of Guinea, together with French President François Hollande, and then visited Macenta, a rural district in the country’s forest region, close to where the outbreak began.
In both places, I witnessed firsthand the virus’s devastating impact: suffering, fear, despair, and, ultimately, death.
Even the trivial has become weighted with meaning: no one shook hands.
The truth is that the Ebola virus continues to spread – and quickly.
Granted, it has been contained in Liberia, but only in Liberia, and even there, there is no way to ensure that another outbreak will not occur.
Ebola is spreading in ways that differ from what we have previously seen.
The virus does not spread as rapidly as many others, such as influenza, which in the past limited the scale of epidemics, particularly because outbreaks were confined to rural areas.
But this time, the virus has entered cities and towns, making it especially dangerous.
High population density provides fertile ground for any virus, let alone Ebola.
West Africa’s treacherous combination of widespread poverty, scarce medical resources, and crowded urban areas can be devastatingly deadly.
Nearly 7,500 people are reported to have died from Ebola this year.
More than 16,000 are reported to have been infected.
These are ballpark figures, and while they provide important information about the trajectory of the epidemic and the effectiveness of response efforts, officials warn that the real numbers are probably far higher.
Health is a global public good.
In most countries, the right to health is enshrined in the constitution or legislation.
The right, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), includes “access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality.”
But, in the case of viruses like Ebola, few states, if any, can issue such guarantees.
From a moral point of view, it is incumbent upon the international community, with its institutions, authorities, resourceful businesses, and individuals – as well as its knowledge and wealth – to deploy the necessary means to stop the spread of Ebola.
The imperative is equally strong from a purely self-interested point of view.
If the virus is not quickly contained, everyone – every country – will be at risk.
The good news is that Ebola can be contained.
Eventually, it can be eradicated.
If we are to achieve this, however, the virus must be understood and diagnosed.
Its spread must be prevented, and treatment must be offered.
Though there is no clinically proven vaccine against Ebola, this could soon change.
Since the outbreak of the virus in March, the Institut Pasteur, an independent, non-profit research organization, has worked to understand how the virus can be contained and what treatment can be offered.
Our researchers are tracking the spread of the virus to understand how epidemics evolve, and we are working to empower local scientific and medical personnel.
We expect to have two vaccine agents ready for clinical trials in 2015.
The Institut Pasteur’s Ebola Task Force is fighting the virus on the ground in West Africa and in the laboratory in France, studying the virus and how it spreads, and leaving no stone unturned to find a medical solution that will stop this outbreak and prevent new ones.
Together with the WHO and non-governmental organizations including Médecins Sans Frontières and the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the Institut Pasteur is committed to fighting the virus and its causes.
Countries around the world have pledged support, financial and otherwise, to tackle the most immediate concerns: helping affected people and communities.
Many countries already contribute to research into the causes, spread, and treatment of the Ebola virus.
An international “coalition of the willing” has been established, and we call on all states, relevant organizations, interested businesses, and qualified individuals to join it.
Together, we can and will see the end of Ebola.

Liz Truss vs. the Bank of England
NEW YORK – Following a week of financial-market turbulence, UK Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to scrap her plan to abolish the 45% top income-tax rate for high earners.
This U-turn, an attempt to counter a stunning market sell-off that caused the pound to crash and saw the Bank of England launch a massive bond-buying program to prevent “material risk to UK financial stability,” is a necessary first step toward stabilizing the economy.
But unless Truss reverses more of the tax cuts or introduces policies to protect pensioners and help struggling mortgage borrowers, the market turmoil will not end soon.
In fact, it could get worse.
The “mini-budget” that Truss and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng proposed at the end of last month, which includes sweeping tax cuts for corporations and the rich, would likely cause an economy-wide surge in demand, further overheating the UK economy and pushing up the already-high inflation rate.
The prices of British gilts fell during the week of September 23-27, as investors expected the BOE to offset inflationary pressures by raising interest rates faster than it had planned.
But instead of selling bonds, the BOE began buying gilts to push down the interest rate.
What explains this maneuver?
Government bonds are a key part of many pension-fund portfolios, and in recent years, many UK pension funds used so-called liability-driven investment strategies to hedge against risks.
As yields on UK government bonds soared, pension funds struggled to meet collateral requests.
The BOE’s attempt to stabilize the price of long-term bonds was thus meant to prevent the fallout in the pensions sector from spilling over and causing a full-blown financial meltdown.
But the BOE most likely has another motive for intervening in the government-bond market. Unlike the US housing market, where 15-30-year fixed-rate mortgages are common, many UK homeowners have floating-rate mortgages.
About one-third of the country’s mortgages are on fixed rates that will expire in the coming two years.
This means that any interest-rate increase would raise the monthly mortgage payments of many British homeowners immediately or very soon.
It would also make mortgages less affordable, driving many prospective home buyers to put off buying a house.
So, the BOE’s intervention may have prevented a mortgage-market meltdown and a housing market crisis at the same time.
But it will also boost inflation.
US President Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts in the early 1980s – an inspiration for Truss and Kwarteng’s program – generated upward pressure on prices, but the effect on inflation was offset by the Federal Reserve’s decision to sell US Treasuries rather than buy them.
The BOE’s bond-buying program, on the other hand, will add fuel to the inflationary fire.
Given the BOE’s inflation-fighting mandate, it is reasonable to expect that it would look for ways to undo or at least mitigate the impact of its intervention.
But monetary policymakers are stuck between a rock and a hard place. They can either raise the interest rate to fight inflation – thereby tolerating falling bond prices and risking mortgage troubles – or lower the interest rate to bail out mortgage borrowers and bond investors and accept rising inflation.
Truss can and must help the BOE find a way out of this conundrum.
Given that she has demonstrated a willingness to increase government borrowing to pay for a two-year cap on household energy payments, she could also introduce a two-year cap on household mortgage payments and add protections for pensioners.
To be sure, price caps are not the most effective way to deal with either skyrocketing energy bills or higher mortgage payments.
But if the government is willing to cap households’ energy payments, it might as well cap mortgage payments, too, since both have the same “popularist” logic.
Yes, doing so would increase the deficit – but it would also allow the BOE to focus on fighting inflation without worrying too much about pension and mortgage crises.
The best way the government can stabilize the UK economy and fight inflation, however, is to reverse more of the planned tax cuts, replace the energy-price cap with a fixed subsidy per household, and implement most of the spending cuts it announced.
The UK’s corporate and personal income tax rates were among the lowest in the OECD even before Truss and Kwarteng’s budget plan, so it is hard to make the case that substantial tax cuts are required to make the UK more competitive.
Moreover, providing a fixed energy subsidy instead of an energy cap would require a smaller government expenditure to provide the same amount of help to lower-income households, provide an incentive to save energy, and reduce the overall cost of energy-price relief.
The combination of spending cuts and reversal of some of the announced tax cuts would have an inflation-reducing effect akin to an interest-rate increase.
That would make it easier for the BOE to tame inflation with a smaller increase in the interest rate.
And by facilitating the task of lowering inflation, the UK government could also make the pound more attractive to currency traders, potentially reversing some of sterling’s recent declines.

In Defense of Angela Merkel
PARIS – The recent cover of Der Spiegel showing German Chancellor Angela Merkel in front of the Acropolis surrounded by Nazi officers serves an important purpose: it finally poses, in a way that cannot be evaded, the question of Germanophobia in Europe.
The abuse of Germany has dragged on for quite some time.
Demonstrations in Cyprus in March 2013 included banners bearing caricatures of Merkel done up as Adolf Hitler.
In Valencia at around the same time, on the occasion of the annual Fallas celebration, there was Merkel as an evil headmistress delivering to the head of the Spanish government and his ministers “The Ten Commandments of Angela the Exterminator.”
She ended up being burned in effigy in the flames of the bonfires of St. Joseph.
Two months later, in Portugal, similar parades featured the same Hitlerized Merkel caricatures, borne by howling demonstrators dressed in mourning clothes and decrying the German leader’s “policy of massacring the poor.”
And, naturally, there was Greece, where the phenomenon reached its apogee during the near-riots of October 2012, in which the world was treated to the spectacle of Nazi and German flags flown together – and then burned – together before the Acropolis in scenes that presaged the Der Spiegel cover.
In Italy, the right-wing daily newspaper Il Giornale had no scruples about devoting its headline for August 3, 2012, to the emergence of the “Fourth Reich.”
Likewise, conspiracy websites in the countries of northern Europe claim that Germany’s eagerness to support Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko against Russian President Vladimir Putin is a reenactment of Hitler’s subjugation of Ukraine.
Then there is France, where the game seems to be to see who can come out on top in populist denunciations of the new and detestable “German empire.”
From the extreme right, National Front leader Marine Le Pen chides Merkel for the “suffering” that she is imposing on the peoples of Europe.
From the opposite extreme, we have the Left Party’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon thundering against Merkel’s “austerity” policy and inviting her to “shut up.”
The problem with this Germanophobia is not simply that it is stupid, or that it is yet another symptom of the decomposition, before our eyes, of the noble European project of integration and ever-closer union.
No, the problem with today’s Germanophobia is that, contrary to what the sorcerer’s apprentices who stoke it would have us believe, their behavior is not a sign of their opposition to the true fascism that lies on the horizon, but rather of their allegiance – and even contribution – to it.
Why?
There are several reasons.
For starters, to oppose Germany’s social, economic, and foreign policies by equating Merkel with Hitler is to banalize Hitler.
However legitimate disagreement with those policies may be, Germany is one of the continent’s most scrupulous and exemplary democracies.
To say that it resembles in any way the Nazi regime – which in Europe still stands for the destruction of democracy (indeed, civilization itself) – is to exonerate that regime, and to reassure and encourage today’s neo-fascists, allowing them, whether intentionally or not, to reenter the public debate.
What is more (and this is key), those keenest to discredit Merkel just happen to be the same people who do not hesitate to waltz with Viennese neo-Nazis or to form an alliance, as in Athens, with the leaders of a genuinely extremist party.
All of the clamor raised around a Germany that has supposedly “reunited with its demons” masks the voice of fascistic parties – from Greece’s Golden Dawn to Hungary’s Jobbik, Slovakia’s SNS, Belgium’s Vlaams Belang, and Bulgaria’s Ataka – that are in the process of establishing themselves in Europe.
It should also be noted that Merkel is a woman, and that hatred for women – the disdain in which they, right alongside the Jews, were regarded by the racist theoreticians of the 1920s and 1930s – has been an essential dimension of every expression of fascism.
Likewise, the slogans slung about in Valencia in October 2012 – with demonstrators urged to chant at the chancellor’s effigy, “You will love money above all else” and “You will honor the banks and the Bank” – had the unmistakably foul odor of the old mantras about “the golden calf” and the “cosmopolitan plutocracy.”
People have finally come to understand that anti-Americanism, born on the extreme right and fed, in Germany, for example, by the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and his acolytes, is a fixture of fascism.
It is now time for us to understand that the same is true of Germanophobia.
In France, it appeared with the French anti-Semitic novelist and activist Maurice Barrès, who saw in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant a vehicle for the “Jewification” of European minds.
It triumphed with Charles Maurras’ Action Française and its protracted war with “Jewish and Germanic abstractions.”
And it culminated with the red-brown cells that, even today, on sites that I prefer not to mention, offer “grub” and a “hideout” for persons willing to “bump off” the “bosses” on the chancellor’s “payroll.”
The history of ideas has its logic, reason, and folly, its unconscious and its trajectory.
It is both futile and dangerous to deny any of them.
That is why, today, it is critically important, in the face of a dark force that is rising, swelling, and unfurling in Europe, to defend Angela Merkel.

Trump’s New Troubles
WASHINGTON, DC – As the US Congress reconvenes this week after a six-week recess, the administration is mired in controversies, almost all of them set off by President Donald Trump.
Trump’s behavior has been at its most peculiar since he took office, undoubtedly partly owing to panic over the 2020 election.
He has more reason than most incumbent presidents to wish for reelection, as he is still facing several lawsuits.
Perhaps the greatest political danger to Trump lies in the growing evidence that he has used the presidency to enrich himself.
Unlike his predecessors, Trump declined to put his assets in a blind trust, and he is being sued for accepting constitutionally prohibited “emoluments” (payments to a president by foreign governments).
For example, the Saudi regime and others have made extensive use of his hotels, including one near the White House.
Similarly, at last month’s G7 summit, Trump let it be known that he wants to host next year’s meeting at his struggling Doral golf resort near Miami.
Voters may well have grown accustomed to Trump’s frequent patronage of his own hotels and golf facilities (along with the cost of the Secret Service and other attendants).
According to one estimate, by mid-July, Trump had spent 194 days at his own golf courses, earning the Trump Organization $109 million.
Various Republican Party functions have taken place on his properties.
But in recent days, Trump’s presidential greed was in particularly high relief.
First, there was Vice President Mike Pence, who, earlier this month, stayed at a Trump-owned facility in Ireland, flying 181 miles (291 kilometers) to reach his high-level meetings.
Pence’s chief of staff ultimately confessed that Trump had “suggested” the accommodations.
Shortly thereafter, Politico reported that earlier this year, a military transport on a routine supply trip to the Middle East refueled near a Trump-owned property in Scotland, where the fuel cost more than at military facilities normally used during flights to the Middle East.
The five-man crew stayed overnight at Trump’s also struggling Turnberry golf resort.
Having discovered many more stopovers at Turnberry, the Air Force has ordered a review of its use of stopover facilities around the world.
Trump has turned the presidency into a racket.
In addition to revelations of Trump’s venality, his near-pathological insecurity has become increasingly flagrant.
To Trump’s mind, an associate has said, to admit an error is to appear weak.
The most flagrant recent example was his desperation to convince the public he hadn’t been wrong in predicting Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama.
It was so essential to him that, using a black marker, he modified a National Weather Service map to indicate that the state would be affected.
Then, at the president's behest, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, issued an unsigned statement supporting Trump and repudiating a correction of Trump that had been issued by the service’s meteorologists in Birmingham, Alabama.
Thus, a crucial federal science agency was corrupted, and in the future, no one can be certain of the truth of Trump’s emergency warnings.
Trump stirred up another ruckus in early September by ordering $3.6 billion in Pentagon construction funds to be shifted to his phantasmagoric wall on the southern border with Mexico.
Despite doubts about the constitutionality of a president unilaterally diverting appropriations approved by Congress, 127 projects – many of them schools and other facilities to take care of military families, and some of them in states represented by Republicans up for reelection next year – lost their funding.
Trump has also transferred funds to be used for disaster relief – on the eve of hurricane season.
These moves highlight Trump’s desperation to have a substantial portion of the wall built or underway by the election.
He’s a long way from it.
What he first depicted as a 1,000-mile concrete barrier is now to be about half that length and, so far, all that has been constructed is 64 miles of steel fences to replace structures installed during the Obama administration.
With his supporters feeling let down by the lack of progress, the president even told aides to seize private lands if necessary and that he would pardon them if they broke the law.
Although few believe that Trump’s wall is the most efficient way to keep out illegal immigrants, his mentions of it during the 2016 campaign drew wild cheers (at the time, he assured the crowds that Mexico would pay for it).
They still do, so he has stuck himself with the issue.
Other major issues on the agenda this fall – including gun control (which the administration is resisting even as it bans vaping pens) and a decision by House Democrats on whether to launch a formal impeachment process – are also likely to ratchet up pressure on Trump.
Foreign policy, too, is causing Trump – and the country – problems.
His tariff war with China is damaging the US economy; signature initiatives, including direct negotiations with North Korea and the Taliban, are unraveling.
Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, predictably, has backfired.
Trump's sudden dismissal this week of John Bolton, his third national security adviser – Bolton insists that he quit – was both surprising and inevitable; it’s well known that two men have disagreed on most foreign-policy issues.
Bolton was the hawk to Trump’s dove; one of the more interesting disclosures about the president is that he really doesn’t want to go to war.
The final split came when Bolton let it be known that he opposed Trump's negotiating with the Taliban so that US troops could be withdrawn from Afghanistan, preferably by the election.
Bolton strongly opposed Trump's wacky idea of hosting the Taliban at a Camp David peace conference.
Bolton’s removal won’t make much difference.
Many of Trump’s goals are unrealistic.
He’s a bad negotiator.
And his White House has no coherent decision-making process.
US foreign policy has come to reflect Trump’s caprices and his outsize faith in his ability to persuade others.
The Republican Party has lashed its fate to an increasingly unhinged leader.
Though three other presidential hopefuls for 2020 are challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, none can defeat him.
But they can damage his reelection effort, which is why the Republican Party has been scrapping some primaries and caucuses.
How well Trump does in November next year may well depend on how his fragile ego withstands the coming months.

Israel’s Government Hawks and Military Doves
PRINCETON – Those who lead Israel’s defense establishment often come to consider peace with the Palestinians a necessary condition for the country’s security.
Being tasked with maintaining the territories Israel has occupied since the Six-Day War in 1967 evidently causes the military and security brass to support political measures that would end the occupation.
And yet the government shows no interest in pursuing a permanent settlement.
To appreciate this divide, consider the late Meir Dagan, who served as Major General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and then as Director of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.
Several years ago, I sat on a panel at a conference in Jerusalem convened by then-Israeli President Shimon Peres.
To my right sat Dagan, who had just completed eight years as head of Mossad; to my left sat Dore Gold, a former academic and former Israeli ambassador.
The two men held very different views about how best to guarantee Israel’s security, and it is worth recapitulating their respective arguments.
Gold argued that returning to pre-1967 armistice lines would leave Israel without “defensible borders.”
He insisted that Israel could guard against threats from the east only if it maintained a military presence in the West Bank and controlled the Jordan River – which runs along the border separating Jordan from Israel and the West Bank.
Dagan countered that the military’s role is to safeguard Israel’s borders, regardless of where those borders are drawn.
While the IDF would certainly prefer to operate with the strategic advantages that holding more territory can confer, it would fulfill its mission under whatever conditions the Israeli government set for it.
But Dagan went further, describing the principle of “defensible borders” as a canard that ignores the intentions and capabilities of the party on the other side of the border.
With an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, the burden of defending the border would be vastly reduced, because Israel would have a serious cross-border partner with a mutual interest in avoiding armed conflict.
A Palestinian security force would by default provide a significant measure of security for Israel as well.
Dagan’s dovish position has a long tradition in Israel’s defense establishment.
Peace Now, a nongovernmental organization that represents Israelis who support a political resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was founded in 1978 when 348 IDF reservists sent a letter to then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin urging him to conclude the peace process with Egypt.
Similarly, in the aftermath of the first Intifada, the Palestinian uprising that lasted from 1987 to 1993, the defense establishment led the effort for peace.
In 1991 Yitzhak Rabin – a former IDF chief of staff, prime minister, and defense minister who at the time served on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset, Israel’s legislature – argued for a comprehensive regional peace effort.
Like Dagan, Rabin considered the Arab-Israeli conflict to be a burden on Israel’s security, and both active and retired military officers have since then led or participated in negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria.
Most recently, many prominent former defense figures supported the deal reached between Iran and the so-called P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany) over Iran’s nuclear program – an agreement that Israel’s government bitterly opposed.
Indeed, the divide between the security establishment and the politicians now governing Israel seems wider than ever.
Most former senior defense officials echo Dagan’s argument, while government officials sound more like Gold.
A number of advocacy organizations have emerged to push for peace.
The Peace and Security Association, which includes hundreds of veterans of the IDF, Mossad, Shin Bet (Israel’s domestic security agency), and the National Police Force, says its mission is, “to promote a sustainable political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a critical component of Israel’s national security and social resilience.”
The nongovernmental organization Commanders for Israel’s Security (CIS), with more than 200 members from Israel’s security elite, just published a paper titled “Security First” with a comprehensive set of proposals to revitalize efforts to share peacefully the land west of the Jordan River.
CIS maintains that terror against Israel cannot be defeated by military means alone, and that any peace process must improve Palestinians’ quality of life.
Senior former Israeli security officials also participated actively in a study undertaken by the Center for a New American Security that produced a detailed security plan for an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
Some former officials have gone even further: Former Mossad Director Efraim Halevy argues that Israel should accept “the political reality of Hamas” and open a dialogue with the organization that governs the Gaza Strip.
Likewise, in the 2012 documentary The Gatekeepers, six former heads of Shin Bet reflect on the lessons of the past few decades and issue a call for peace with the Palestinians.
Remarkably, Israel’s political leadership has not suffered electorally for ignoring the views of the defense establishment.
There was no public reaction when, after The Gatekeepers was released, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement saying he had not seen the documentary and had no intention of doing so.
Given the public’s high regard for the Israeli defense establishment, particularly relative to the government, voters’ indifference is a mystery.
In a 2015 survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, 93% of Israeli Jews expressed trust in the army, compared to only 40% in the government, and only 22% in Israeli political parties.
One answer is that, after so many failed efforts, the Israeli public is disillusioned with the peace process.
Moreover, acts of incitement and terrorism emanating from the occupied territories have intensified.
This allows the current governing coalition to justify policies – such as enabling expanded settlement activity in the West Bank – that further deepen the conflict.
Against this backdrop, Netanyahu has portrayed himself as Israel’s protector, appropriating the esteem afforded to the defense establishment.
Those calling for a renewed peace process will now have to make their case to the public and reclaim that title.
Whether they can do that in a context of regional turmoil and domestic insecurity remains uncertain, to say the least.

Russia's Manipulative Media
MOSCOW: Today, there are no political parties in Russia, only mass media.
This is the little noticed result of the last parliamentary and presidential elections.
To be sure, the press is powerful in most democracies and often influences the ways in which political messages are read by the public.
But in more developed systems, political programs and ideas are ultimately the work of political parties and politicians – what people ultimately vote for or against.
In Russia, the media don't "mediate"; they are the very source of Russia's political ideas.
Russian voters vote don't vote a party line, they vote the mass media line.
Last summer there was little doubt that the coming parliamentary elections would make the Luzhkov/Primakov Fatherland-All Russia party (OVR) the biggest fraction in the Duma.
After the vote on December 19, OVR was not even runner up: it came third, with 13% of the vote and 46 out of 450 seats in the Duma.
Similarly, no one doubted last July that the next President would be either ex-prime minister Primakov or Moscow's mayor Luzhkov.
All that was left to guessing was which of the two would agree to be prime-minister in the other's presidential administration.
When the presidential election occurred, however, neither man was anywhere to be seen.
What happened to OVR, supposedly the new party of power?
What happened to Primakov and Luzhkov?
Did they change their political positions?
Did OVR commit some huge political blunder that finished them off?
They were destroyed, not by themselves or their unpopularity with voters, but by the mass media.
That same mass media also created a new idol who has now swept all before him.
A new inter-regional movement, Unity, founded only in September ‘99, dominated the parliamentary elections last December on a platform that could be summarized in two words: Vladimir Putin.
From then on the presidential election was a yawn: the only (not very exciting) question was whether Putin would need one or two rounds to switch from being the "acting" to the "elected" holder of the highest office.
In the wake of Putin's personal juggernaut, Unity also lapsed into desuetude.
To understand what happened, we need to look beyond politics and into the psychological makeup of Russian voters.
Only two groups of Russians today show some resistance to the all-powerful sway of the media.
The first – around 30% of the voting population – is made up of political extremes, mostly hard core communist supporters for whom "party discipline"and unqualified hatred of everything since the Soviet Union's collapse trumps all other considerations.
Included in this 30% is a also sprinkling of right-wing nationalists who look at post-1991 history as a vast anti-Russian conspiracy.
The other group less subject to informational hypnosis are young people.
By and large, the new generation, grown to adulthood after 1991, has its own mind and does not look at every published word as if it was revealed truth.
But in what is perhaps the most damning failure of democracy in Russia, the young are politically apathetic and refuse to vote or actively participate in politics.
The rest of the Russian public is held in thrall by TV and the press.
How?
After all, the Russian media do not seem more trustworthy, better informed, or more professionally run than in most countries; quite to the contrary, they are owned by a few oligarchs, and their bias and manipulation are both transparent and crude.
The answer lies in the most insidious Soviet heritage.
More than 62 million Russians who are over 40 today were formed by the Soviet system.
Although many do not have much sympathy for the old regime, most have been conditioned to view any published word, or anything they see on TV, as a type of gospel truth not subject critical assessment.
Such atrophy of critical thinking and unprecedented information naivete make it possible for a politically and financially motivated press to manipulate a good half of the voters.
The abnormal power of the media also means that they are not run as normal businesses.
Since owning the media allows powerful interests to achieve their coveted political or economic objectives, political influence, not profit, drives media behavior.
Just look at who stands behind the most important newspapers and TV stations in Russia.
The largest players are the state and business empires for which the media is not a significant profit center.
The list of major owners, in addition to the federal government and the usually mentioned moguls, such as Berezovsky and Gusinsky, includes the oil giant Lukoil, the gas empire Gazprom, the financial group Oneksimbank, the Moscow government, and others.
Of these, only the Gusinsky group derives its profits primarily from the media.
Another peculiarity of Russia's media market, stemming from the absence of the profit motive, is a chronic overproduction of titles.
New players are forever trying to gain a foothold of political influence.
17 daily newspapers are published in Moscow, 10 of which call themselves "national."
Some 5,000 newspapers appear in Russia.
Their total combined circulation is of similar size to total newspaper circulation in Germany, but there fewer than 500 titles do the job.
All the while, the total volume of advertisements during the best of times (before the 1998 crisis) did not exceed $2.5billion, as compared with more than $20 billion in Germany and more than $117 billion in America.
The power to think critically develops only slowly.
So Russia must wait before Russian politics asserts its independence and the media learns to report, rather than create.
The hope that this may one day happen lies in the fact that, despite its corruption, the media is free – one of the great legacies of Yeltsin's presidency.

The Greening of Work
MONACO – When environment ministers from some 100 countries meet here on February 20-22 for UNEP’s Governing Council and Environmental Forum, talks will focus on environmentally friendly “green growth” and ways and means by which the world can achieve a low-carbon economy.
The employment and development potential of combating climate change is only now being understood as a part of this effort.
UNEP has invited the International Labour Organization and the International Trade Union Confederation to contribute to these discussions.
Changes underway are a result of the Kyoto Protocol, but they are also partly being made in anticipation of deeper emission cuts to come.
Equally important, the perception of organized labor and industry concerning environmental issues is changing dramatically.
Environmental regulation was sometimes viewed with suspicion and concern for business and labour.
Now, business sees profits and unions see jobs.
Consider these facts:
·A Washington-based consulting firm estimates that the U.S. environmental industry generated more than $340 billion in sales and almost $50 billion in tax revenues in 2005.
The 5.3 million workers in the environmental industry outnumber pharmaceutical workers ten to one.
·A British company specializing in improving the energy efficiency of homes was floated on the London Stock Exchange last June and now employs 4,000 people who once worked in nearby, now closed, coal mines.
·A study prepared for the German Ministry of Environment estimates that employment in the German environmental technology industries will surpass employment in the automobile industry by 2020.
·China has some 1,000 solar thermal energy firms, generating sales of $2.5 billion and employing 600,000 workers in manufacturing and installation.
·The Indian city of Delhi is introducing new eco-friendly compressed natural gas buses, which will create an additional 18,000 new jobs.
These trends look set to continue.
The United Nations Environment Programme’s Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative estimates that investment in renewable energy has reached $100 billion worldwide, or 18% of new investment in the power sector.
The Initiative, which involves some 170 financial institutions, also estimates that market financing for clean and renewable energies could reach $1.9 trillion by 2020.
International efforts are now beginning to bear fruit.
The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol could channel $100 billion in funds from North to South for investment in carbon offsetting projects such as renewable energy schemes and tree planting.
The Bali conference last year agreed to include avoided deforestation in tropical countries into a new climate regime, which could generate new employment opportunities in sustainable management, conservation, and tourism.
Several countries, including Costa Rica, Norway, and New Zealand, have pledged carbon neutrality, which in turn will require investment and employment in carbon-friendly sectors.
Significantly, labor is adding to the effort.
At Bali, the global trade union movement signaled its commitment to an 85% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, underlining the perceived value of environmentally sustainable development and a future in “green jobs.”
These jobs will play a vital role in reducing the environmental footprint of economies and promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns.
In a rapidly greening labor market, those jobs lost to environmental unsustainability will have to be replaced by just transitions involving the promotion of social security, economic diversification and retraining.
Yet green jobs are not enough.
Meeting the challenge of climate change will require a new development model that combines reduced emissions with a better future for the vast majority of people and the opportunity to earn a living in a decent job.
Last month, President Hu Jintao of China called for the realization of sustainable development and decent work by advancing “economic globalization in the direction of balanced development, shared benefit and win-win progress and to make sure that international economic, trade and financial institutions provide favorable conditions … so that the 21st century is genuinely a century of development for all … to realize sustainable development and for the vast majority of workers to enjoy decent work”.
Clearly, change is in the air.
Our responses to climate change must have a social dimension.
Workers, employers and governments must engage in dialogue to put in place the social policies which ensure that green jobs are decent jobs.
Only in this way can the poor and the jobless from Marseille to Mumbai and Sao Paulo to Shanghai be optimistic that creating an environmentally-sustainable world will also deliver decent, environmentally-sustainable work.

The Digital Money Revolution
LONDON – How radically will digital currencies change our methods of exchange and the way that we think about money?
With innovation in digital payments barreling ahead, these questions are now commanding the attention of the World Economic Forum and other international institutions.
Regardless of how Facebook’s own digital-currency moonshot, Libra, fares, it has already provided a wake-up call for firms and policymakers around the world. “If revolution there is to be, let us rather undertake it than undergo it,” Otto von Bismarck once said.
The question for policymakers is not whether to try to shape the digital-money revolution, but how.
Digital money is already a key battleground in finance, with technology firms, payment processing companies, and banks all vying to become the gateway into the burgeoning platform-based economy.
The prizes that await the winners could be huge.
In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay already control more than 90% of all mobile payments.
And in the last three years, the four largest listed payment firms – Visa, Mastercard, Amex, and PayPal – have increased in value by more than the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google).
In a way, Libra is actually crashing the party late.
The opportunities offered by digital money are clear.
Across Western countries, moving money is overly costly and inefficient, and those who end up paying the most are often the ones who can least afford to do so.
As I argued in a report for the Bank of England (BOE) earlier this year, improving these processes could yield significant returns and social benefits.
Moreover, the needs – the potential returns – are even greater in many emerging markets, particularly when it comes to cross-border payments.
According to the World Bank, the cost of sending international peer-to-peer remittances averages around 7% of the sum.
Efforts to improve the main payment channels are ongoing. TransferWise, for example, claims to have reduced the average cost of cross-border transfers for its clients to 0.74%.
But less well-trodden routes remain a challenge, owing to the hurdles posed by anti-money-laundering rules and poor data quality.
Given the concerns that Libra has raised, some central banks have begun to explore the option of issuing their own digital tokens.
Others are studying the thorny legal and regulatory challenges posed by digital money, so that they can safeguard monetary and financial stability.
For her part, Lael Brainard, a governor on the US Federal Reserve Board, recently suggested that the risks of cryptocurrencies outweigh the benefits.
By contrast, the People’s Bank of China is forging ahead – though not toward the decentralized or “permissionless” blockchain model envisioned by crypto enthusiasts.
The PBOC wants to use cryptography to issue tokens to mainstream banks, which will then be passed on to customers within the existing two-tiered banking system.
Hence, if the European Central Bank (or others) wanted to be the first central bank to issue digital money, the opportunity is there for the taking.
To policymakers considering the options presented by digital money, I would offer five recommendations from my BOE report.
First, monetary authorities should create the infrastructure to enable alternative payment methods to connect to one another.
The private sector can flourish when central banks act as a platform for innovation, as BOE Governor Mark Carney has shown by granting non-bank payment firms access to the BOE payments system.
But success will depend on how easily new providers can access the central-bank infrastructure, which will require well-designed application programming interfaces through which to receive and share information.
Second, policymakers should usher in the next generation of payments regulation.
Rules need to be updated to reflect the increasing complexity and shifting risks of the current system.
As the cost of payments falls, the value of data will grow.
Yet existing rules pertaining to data sharing, security, and liability are mostly rudimentary. Given the flurry of new entrants, there is a case to be made for tiering regulation – as the Singaporeans have done – and stress-testing payment firms for their financial resilience and cyber-security protections.
Third, governments need to champion better digital identification, which is essential to improving financial inclusion, curbing cyber fraud, and reducing costs.
Some countries have already made impressive progress on this front.
India, for example, has largely cracked the identification problem with its Aadhaar program, which dramatically simplifies the process through which networks can know their customers.
Countries that do not have a tradition of issuing national ID cards have more work to do, but their governments can cooperate with the private sector, or use existing high-quality national data sets such as passport and tax numbers.
Fourth, all countries need to support stronger messaging standards to improve cross-border payments, reduce costs, and prevent fraud.
Just as postal codes help mail get to the right place, so too could better tagging of payment senders and recipients.
Fifth, and critically, policymakers need to create a roadmap for the decline of cash.
In Sweden, cash payments have fallen by 80% over the past decade, and many other developed markets are just 5-10 years behind.
Digital payments bring many benefits, but the Swedish experience shows that without a coordinated plan, the pace of change risks excluding some groups in society.
As payment habits shift, each country will need a strategy to improve its payments infrastructure – including broadband and mobile-telephony networks – so that no one is left behind.
Payments innovation is moving at a dizzying pace.
Some ideas may fail to get off the ground, while others may need to pivot to become commercially viable.
Other issues, like market dominance or cyber-security risks, will undoubtedly become more prominent in policy debates.
On balance, however, the economic and social benefits of a frictionless, fraud-free, and trusted global payments system will likely outweigh the risks.

Why Trump Cries Electoral Fraud
LONDON – US President Donald Trump, perhaps unsurprisingly, has alleged fraud in the November 3 presidential election, without offering what anyone would consider real evidence, other than the fact that votes for his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, keep turning up in states where Trump initially led in the count.
The president has already announced that he intends to take the election to the US Supreme Court, despite the fact that at the time of his statement, millions of votes in numerous states were still to be counted.
Yet Trump’s fraud claims could be part of a psychological strategy, deftly executed by a master manipulator.
If so, the president may be paving the way to persuading large numbers of Americans to reject the legitimacy of his defeat.
A unique scientific study conducted the day before and the morning of the 2016 US presidential election, probing attitude changes in 1,000 US voting-age adults, found that exposure to conspiratorial rhetoric about election interference produced a profound psychological effect.
In particular, it led to significantly heightened negative emotions (anxiety and anger), and also undermined support for democratic institutions.
The study, recently published in the academic journal Research & Politics, found that those exposed to conspiracy theories regarding election-rigging were less willing to accept the results of an election, and became less inclined to concede the outcome when the result threatened their partisan goals.
Its authors, Bethany Albertson and Kimberly Guiler of the University of Texas at Austin, argue that vote-rigging allegations strike at the very foundations of democracy.
For example, they may render the public doubtful as to whether non-violent transfers of national authority should follow from a rigged vote.
Moreover, the study contends that political conspiracy theories may have ominous, extensive, and long-lasting consequences, such as reducing political participation, trust in government, confidence in elections, and faith in democracy.
Vote-rigging stories immediately after an election also can profoundly affect voters’ mental state.
Besides becoming angrier and more anxious, voters in the study also reacted with increased sadness and disgust, and both Democrats and Republicans reported feeling less enthusiastic and less hopeful.
The authors suggest that the deep emotional and psychological effects they uncovered might also reflect the fact that people were on edge on election day, in a way that made both groups of partisans receptive to conspiratorial rhetoric.
They conclude that Americans are vulnerable to being affected significantly by election-rigging allegations.
Throughout his presidency and the two election campaigns he has now waged, Trump has time and again demonstrated a better feel for his electorate’s mental state than the US intelligentsia and chattering classes have.
The latter groups might dismiss Trump’s fraud allegations as merely the childish reactions of a sore loser, but there is a psychological method to his seemingly mad claims.
Another recent study published in Political Research Quarterly examined why so many Americans are prone to believe that electoral fraud exists.
The study’s authors, led by political scientists Jack Edelson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joseph Uscinski of the University of Miami, suggested that more deeply embedded conspiratorial thinking may be to blame.
They point to a strong link between feelings of powerlessness and conspiracy paranoia.
Supporters of the losing side in an election are therefore more likely to suspect scams.
US Republicans appear especially prone to believing that people are casting votes they should not, whereas Democrats are more concerned about being disenfranchised.
After Republican challenger Mitt Romney’s defeat in the 2012 US presidential election, the authors note, 49% of Republicans believed that a Democratic activist group had stolen the election for President Barack Obama (only 6% of Democrats believed this).
Likewise, following the 2000 presidential election, 31% of Democrats believed that George W. Bush had stolen the presidency (only 3% of Republicans agreed).
And 30% of Democrats stated that they did not consider Bush a “legitimate president.”
But the authors argue that some measures aimed at combating perceptions of vote-rigging in the United States, such as stricter voter-identification laws upheld by the Supreme Court, could actually make things worse.
Tightening voter-ID requirements leads to yet more conspiracy theories of election-rigging through vote suppression.
Finally, the authors cite a previous study of letters to the editor of the New York Times from 1890 to 2010, which reveals that disgruntled losers call nearly every US presidential election into question.
Trump’s claim of fraud in the 2020 election has taken this practice to a new and potentially dangerous level, with unpredictable psychological and political consequences.
Narcissists, convinced of their superiority, can never accept losing in any contest.
The threat to their ego is too catastrophic.
In their eyes, no one can ever beat them fair and square.
Accusations of cheating thus make perfect psychological sense.
It protects the ego from the threat that losing implies.
But followers may not appreciate a leader’s psychological vulnerability.
Supporters and leaders can then forge a bond in their denial of an emotionally distressing result.
Biden’s strategy of passive “wait and see” may be psychologically naive, reflecting a failure to grasp the emotional power of the subconscious forces being unleashed against him.
A psychiatrist might advise stronger engagement with the mental processes behind Trump’s vote-rigging claims, as opposed to dismissing them.
It follows that Biden’s team should have anticipated and been more prepared – politically, not just legally – for Trump’s moves.
History has shown time and again that when narcissism, emotional distress, and denial combine and go on the march, democracy is in danger of being trampled.

America Is the New Center of Global Instability
NEW YORK – Whether the storming of the US Capitol was an attempted coup, an insurrection, or an assault on democracy is merely a question of semantics.
What matters is that the violence was aimed at derailing a legitimate transition of power for the benefit and at the behest of a dangerous madman.
President Donald Trump, who has never hidden his dictatorial aspirations, should now be removed from power, barred from public office, and prosecuted for high crimes.
After all, the events of January 6 may have been shocking, but they were not surprising.
I and many other commentators had long warned that the 2020 election would bring civil unrest, violence, and attempts by Trump to remain in power illegally.
Beyond his election-related crimes, Trump is also guilty of a reckless disregard for public health.
He and his administration bear much of the blame for the massive COVID-19 death toll in the United States, which accounts for only 4% of the global population but 20% of all coronavirus deaths.
Once a beacon of democracy, rule of law, and good governance, the US now looks like a banana republic that is incapable of controlling either a contagious disease – despite spending more on health care per capita than any other country – or mobs incited by a wannabe dictator.
Authoritarian leaders around the world are now laughing at the US and scoffing at American critiques of others’ political misrule.
As if the damage done to US soft power over the past four years was not immense enough, Trump’s failed insurrection has undermined America’s standing even more.
Worse, although President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated in about a week, that is plenty of time for Trump to create more mayhem.
Right-wing militias and white supremacists are already planning more acts of protest, violence, and racial warfare in cities across the US.
And strategic rivals such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea will be looking to exploit the chaos by sowing disinformation or launching cyber-attacks, including potentially against critical US infrastructure.
At the same time, a desperate Trump may try to “wag the dog” by ordering a strike – perhaps with a tactical nuclear warhead – on Iran’s main nuclear facility in Natanz, on the grounds that it is being used to enrich uranium.
Far from this being out of the question, the Trump administration has already held drills with stealth bombers and fighter jets – loaded, for the first time, with tactical nuclear weapons – to signal to Iran that its air defenses are no defense at all.
No wonder Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi felt the need to reach out to the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss steps to prevent a nuclear strike by the Dr. Strangelove in the White House.
Whereas an unwarranted order to launch a nuclear attack on a target with a large civilian population would be rejected by the military as obviously “illegal,” an attack on a military target in a non-populated area might not be, even if it would have dire geopolitical consequences.
Moreover, Trump knows that both Saudi Arabia and Israel would tacitly support an attack on Iran (indeed, the US may avail itself of Saudi logistical and ground support to carry one out, given the shorter range of nuclear-armed fighter jets).
The prospect of an attack on Iran may give Vice President Mike Pence the pretext he needs to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from power.
But even if this were to happen, it would not necessarily be a win for democracy and the rule of law.
Trump could – and likely would – be pardoned by Pence (as Richard Nixon was by Gerald Ford), allowing him to run for president again in 2024 or be a kingmaker in that election, given that he now controls the Republican party and its base.
Removing Trump with the promise of a pardon may be a Faustian deal that Pence strikes with Trump.
Because the self-pardon that Trump has been considering might not pass constitutional muster, it is reasonable to assume that he will be groping around for other creative outs.
He cannot simply resign and allow Pence to issue a pardon, because that would make him look like a “loser” who accepted defeat (the worst insult in Trump’s egomaniacal lexicon).
But if the president were to order an attack on Iran and then become a (pardoned) martyr, he could both preserve his base and avoid accountability.
By the same token, Trump cannot risk being impeached (again), because that would open up the possibility of his being disqualified from holding office in the future.
By this reasoning, he has every incentive to go out with a bang and on his own terms.
If this all sounds like the final days of Nero “fiddling while Rome burned,” that’s because it is.
The decay of the American empire appears to be hastening rapidly.
Given how politically, socially, and economically divided the US is, four years of sound leadership under Biden will not be enough to reverse the damage that has been done.
Most likely, the Republicans will do everything they can to sabotage the new administration, as they did with former President Barack Obama.
Even before the election, US national-security agencies were warning that domestic right-wing terrorism and violence would remain the primary home-grown threat to the US.
With Biden in office, this risk will be higher still.
For the last four years, heavily armed white-supremacist militias have been kept relatively at bay by dint of the fact that they had an ally in the White House.
But once Trump is gone, the groups whom he has instructed to “stand back and stand by” will not simply accept Democratic control of the presidency and Congress.
Trump, operating from Mar-a-Lago, will continue to incite the mob with more lies, conspiracy theories, and falsehoods about a stolen election.
The US will thus most likely be the world’s new epicenter of political and geopolitical instability in the months and years ahead.
America’s allies will need to hedge their bets against a future return of Trumpism, and strategic rivals will continue to try to destabilize the US through asymmetric warfare.
The world is in for a long, ugly, bumpy ride.

Your Genes or Mine, How Different Are We?
For some time, scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9% genetically identical. The 0.1% of the genome that was different (approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA) was comprised of “single nucleotide polymorphisms” (SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA) scattered throughout the genome.
It was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different, but otherwise normal individuals.
In the summer of 2004, two groups of scientists working independently (one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) called this scientific dogma into question.
Their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual.
With only a few exceptions, all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies (one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father).
Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies.
This alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood, and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery.
This discovery was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion.
That has changed over the last five or six years, with the development of a technique known as “array-based comparative genomic hybridization” (array-CGH), revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics.
About three years ago at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, when we were seeking a potential tool for high-resolution diagnostics, array-CGH offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome-wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non-subjective fashion.
When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “normal, healthy” individual with the DNA from another “normal, healthy” individual, we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared.
These became known as copy number variants, or CNVs.
Combining the data from our study and the study from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit CNVs among normal individuals.
Since these two initial studies, many other groups, including ours, have confirmed and documented many more CNVs in other individuals studied.
This is the goal of the Structural Genomic Variation Consortium’s Copy Number Variation Project, which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of CNVs in humans.
The Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa, Asia or Europe (known as the HapMap collection) to construct a new map of the human genome.
Using two complementary genome-wide technologies, with subsequent validation studies, a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified.
The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought.
Many of the regions in which the CNVs were identified overlapped known disease genes.
Since they are being identified in normal individuals, CNVs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease, but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases, serve as disease markers, and/or indicate potential regions of genomic instability.
Some CNVs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxification-related metabolism (some of the human body’s reactions to the environment that we live in).
Indeed, some CNVs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications.
Hopefully, a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation (i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation, such as CNVs) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner, that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient, with minimal side effects.
Overall, we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-changing environment.
Indeed, as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs, we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations, complex diseases, and human adaptability.

Argentina’s Energy Dilemma
BUENOS AIRES – The expropriation of nearly all of the Spanish company Repsol’s stake in Argentina’s energy producer YPF, announced in a vehement speech by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, has raised legal alarms worldwide.
In fact, the move will not resolve the country’s energy problems in the absence of enormous inflows of investment to the sector.
Repsol acquired complete control of YPF in 1999; in February 2008, it transferred part of its shares to the Petersen Group, which today holds 25%.
Repsol currently holds 57%, with the rest owned by stock-market investors.
The Argentine government intends to expropriate 51%, leaving Repsol with a 6% stake.
In the 2008 sale of shares, the two majority stockholders agreed to distribute at least 90% of future profits in cash.
That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks, and to Repsol itself, that it incurred with its share purchase, for which it made no initial payment.
This is an extraordinarily high dividend in the world oil industry.
In the past decade, YPF’s reserves diminished significantly, along with those of most oil companies operating in Argentina, because investment in exploration was greatly reduced.
At the same time, natural gas accounts for 51% of energy consumption, compared to 32% for oil and barely 17% for coal, renewables, and hydroelectric and nuclear power.
Worldwide, gas accounts for barely a quarter of total energy consumption – for example, 27% in the United States and just 9% in neighboring Brazil.
Argentina has the world’s largest fleet of vehicles running on compressed natural gas; families use gas intensively; most electricity is generated with gas; and the petrochemical industry is based on it.
Of course, in a few other countries (Qatar, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Russia), gas also accounts for more than half – or even more than 60% – of energy consumption.
But there is an enormous difference: all of these countries have reserves that will last another 70-100 years.
Argentina, by contrast, is a highly gas-dependent country with diminishing reserves – equivalent to less than eight years of production.
Covering this drop in reserves – more than half of gas reserves and a fifth of oil reserves have been consumed – with imports implies an annual cost of more than $300 billion.
Indeed, after two decades of cheap, abundant energy and exports of surplus output, a new cycle of expensive, scarce, and imported energy has begun, as oil production has fallen by one-third since 1998, and gas production by 15% since 2004.
Argentina’s greatest challenge today is to try to regain energy self-sufficiency through significant investment in exploration on land, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the country must modify its consumption model through greater reliance on hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind energy.
While there is great potential for new non-conventional resources, all of this is expensive, requiring annual investment of about 3% of GDP over the next five years.
It is very likely that, in the short term, growing imports of expensive liquid natural gas and other fuels will continue to exert pressure for change.
Last year, the external energy deficit was more than $3 billion, and this year it is expected to double.
The important question is whether the Argentine government’s decision to nationalize 51% of YPF’s shares is the best way to recover self-sufficiency in oil and gas production, and to attract the capital needed for exploration and development of conventional reserves.
Argentina has particularly high potential for production of non-conventional gas resources as well, given that it holds the world’s third-highest level of such reserves, after China and the United States.
But, as with the country’s conventional resources, these reserves will not produce themselves.
