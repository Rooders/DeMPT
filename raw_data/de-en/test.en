A Woman’s Place Is in the Digital Revolution
MONTREAL – Digital technologies are a double-edged sword for the world’s women.
Men’s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially.
But if women can tap the full power of digital technologies, vital new opportunities will open up for them.
According to estimates by the GSM Association, women’s access to the Internet and mobile phones is about 85% of the level for men, on average, and a total of 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries are unconnected.
This severely limits the prospects of women and girls.
Digital technologies enhance women’s access to finance, with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long journeys to a branch or ATM.
Likewise, technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes, as it reaches women even in the remotest areas, sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor.
The timesaving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment.
Today, women undertake three-quarters of all unpaid care work, producing output of around $10 trillion, or 13% of global GDP – none of which is translated into income, let alone economic power.
By their nature, e-commerce and technology-based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy, helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work.
In Indonesia, women-owned businesses generate 35% of e-commerce revenue, compared with only 15% of the revenue of offline businesses.
Likewise, in China, 55% of new Internet businesses are founded by women, and Alibaba’s Taobao e-commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners.
In fact, China is home to 114 of the world’s 147 self-made female billionaires, compared to just 14 in the second-place country, the United States.
Women’s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit.
The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has estimated that advancing gender equality could add $12 trillion per year to the world economy by 2025.
In the Asia-Pacific region alone, getting more women into full-time employment in higher-paid, higher-productivity sectors could add $4.5 trillion per year to GDP, 12% above the current trajectory.
At the company level, a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines.
Greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision-making.
If given the opportunity, women could be leading innovators in the age of automation and artificial intelligence, and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias.
But major barriers prevent women from seizing these opportunities.
For example, in India, where only 29% of all Internet users are female, girls in rural areas often face gender-based restrictions on their use of information and communications technologies.
One village in Uttar Pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home.
Beyond the social attitudes that undermine women’s access to digital technologies, women and girls often disproportionately lack the requisite skills to seize the opportunities of the digital age.
In Singapore, for example, women lag behind men in education in science, math, engineering, and technology.
At Nanyang Technological University, females comprised only 27% of the undergraduate computer-science program in 2015-2016, despite accounting for half of all undergraduates at the university.
What is at stake is not just women’s ability to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution, but also their capacity to withstand the coming wave of automation.
According to MGI research, in Singapore alone, 800,000 full-time-equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to automation.
The jobs that are most vulnerable to automation are the low-paid, lower-skill jobs that women are more likely to hold.
At the same time, though automation risks disrupting many jobs (or tasks within jobs) for both men and women, it also takes some of the drudgery out of current work, tailoring it to human abilities.
The result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases, with emerging economies gaining the most.
Furthermore, among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care, where women have traditionally thrived.
According to MGI research, more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-15 years as health care and education needs grow.
It is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women’s employment.
But there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women’s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills, so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution.
The success of women in e-commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field, to the benefit of individual women, their communities and societies, and the world economy.
More women in work – particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future – would be good news for all.

Who's the Nazi?
WARSAW – Vladimir Putin’s regime has banned Russian media from referring to his invasion of Ukraine as a “war.”
Instead, it is to be framed as “an operation to liberate Ukraine from neo-Nazis.”
The state-run RIA news agency has published lurid propaganda arguing that Russia “for the second time in history will take on the burden of responsibility for the liberation of Ukraine from Nazism.”
Readers are told that “Nazism, having just slightly covered the swastika with cosmetic concealer and high-quality powder” was “the main method of building Ukrainian statehood.”
Now, Russia is carrying out a “denazification” operation “in the interests of all Europe, even if Europe is not aware of it.”
It is worth dissecting this propaganda, because propaganda plays an important role in sustaining Putin’s dictatorship, especially in times of crisis.
And, without Putin’s dictatorship, there certainly would be no war in Ukraine.
The more Russia’s military campaign falls short of what he had hoped, the more he will rely on propaganda.
Over the years, Putin has told the Russian people many contradictory things about Russia and Ukraine.
During his first two terms as president (2000-08), he had ambitions to modernize Russia and deepen its ties with the West.
But after he had gotten a taste of power, he started thinking primarily about how to keep it.
Modernization gave way to police-state brutality, and now, thinking about his place in history, he has concluded that without Ukraine, Russia cannot be a world power.
Yet when he took office, Ukraine was still pro-Russian, and the Kremlin still had significant influence over it.
It was his annexation of Crimea and seizure of 7% of Ukraine’s territory in 2014 that lost Ukrainian hearts and minds.
Between failing to modernize Russia and driving Ukraine away, Putin has committed multiple unforced errors that future generations of Russians will not forgive.
Recall that in the early days, Putin himself considered bringing Russia into the European Union and even NATO.
Denying Ukraine’s sovereignty was not on his mind.
When asked in May 2002 about Ukraine’s declaration of willingness to join NATO, he replied:
“As for NATO enlargement, you know our attitude to this issue.
It does not change, but this does not mean that Ukraine should remain on the sidelines of processes aimed at strengthening peace and security in Europe and on earth in general.
Ukraine is a sovereign state and has the right to independently choose the path to secure its own security.”
But when Ukrainians took to the streets in the 2004 Orange Revolution to protest corruption and electoral fraud, Putin got scared.
What if Russians ever decided to do the same?
By 2008, Putin had adopted a new posture.
Speaking at a NATO-Russia Council meeting in Bucharest, he offered an early preview of the rationale that has now led him to wage aggressive war against Ukraine.
Had Western governments taken him seriously, they would not have spent the past three months guessing at his intentions, and they probably would have supplied Ukraine with more weapons and money.
Putin made his intentions plain:
“The south of Ukraine, completely, there are only Russians.
Who can tell us that we have no interests there? ...
In Ukraine in general, one third of the population is ethnic Russians.
Of the 45 million, according to the official census, 17 million are Russians.
There are regions inhabited only by Russians, say, in Crimea – 90% Russians.
Ukraine in its present form received territory from Poland – after World War II – from Czechoslovakia, Romania.
It received huge territories from Russia in the east and south of the country.
It is a complicated state creation.
And if you add to that the NATO problem, other problems, they can put statehood itself on the brink of existence altogether.”
The two census claims were untrue: 17 million is merely the number of Ukrainians who declared Russian as their first language; and ethnic Russians comprised no more than 60% of Crimea’s population at the time.
But the point is that Putin signaled 14 years ago that he would use historical revisionist claims about Russian minorities outside Russia’s borders as a pretext for interfering in other countries’ internal affairs.
In doing so, he was following in the footsteps of Adolf Hitler, who, six months before invading Poland, used German minority populations across the border as a pretext to destroy democratic Czechoslovakia.
Moreover, like Nazi Germany, Putin is consumed by a stab-in-the-back myth.
Echoing German nationalists in the 1920s and 1930s, he cannot accept the fact that the Soviet Union fell without losing to the West on the battlefield.
The only other explanation is that it must have been betrayed by elites, who dragged the great nation down from within.
Apparently oblivious to these historical parallels, Putin sees Nazis on the march everywhere but at home.
Yet it is he who routinely enlists the help of neo-Nazis like Dmitry Utkin, a mercenary with the Wagner Group, a private army financed by pro-Kremlin oligarchs, who bears Waffen-SS tattoos on his collarbone and chest.
As with Nazi Germany, the Kremlin’s provocations seem extraordinarily inept.
Russia is ostentatiously and brutally violating international law in an effort to humiliate Ukraine and frighten a dissolute West.
That is why the Kremlin’s propaganda has gone to such lengths to smear Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a drug addict and a neo-Nazi, even though he is a Jew whose grandfather fought the Nazis in World War II, and who lost many other relatives in the Holocaust.
Until recently, Russian propaganda has worked not only in Russia but also in the West.
Beyond the US Republicans who have openly sided with Putin, many Germans have long failed to appreciate that the Soviet victims of Nazism were not all Russian.
In fact, Nazism claimed proportionally more Ukrainian victims, and a Ukrainian soldier was the first to open the gates of Auschwitz.
Whatever happens in Ukraine, Moscow has already lost the war for hearts and minds.
The period of craven forbearance toward Russia is ending.
Around the world, the Ukrainian people and their leaders are now regarded as heroes.
And as more body bags arrive in Russia or are burned in mobile crematoriums, even Putin’s closest supporters may come to doubt his leadership.

Syria’s No-Solution Solution
MADRID – Syria is a blood-soaked shambles.
Four years of civil war have left more than 200,000 dead, one million wounded, and 6.7 million people internally displaced.
Another 3.8 million are living as refugees outside the country, and 13 million (out of a pre-war population of 20 million) are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Two illustrious United Nations special envoys – Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi – have resigned in the face of Syria's self-perpetuating spiral of violence.
But, against this bleak background, there is reason for cautious optimism.
Kurdish forces recently succeeded, after months of heavy fighting, in expelling the Islamic State from the border town of Kobane.
Moreover, the new UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has initiated a pragmatic and determined “Aleppo first" strategy, which aims to freeze military operations in the shattered city and facilitate the entry of aid.
Could this mark a turning point for Syria?
When the crisis in Syria erupted, nobody predicted how serious, protracted, and complex it would turn out to be.
For starters, observers underestimated citizens' ever-deepening sense of hopelessness, which has driven them to support jihadi groups or the Assad regime.
The conflict is also unique in its asymmetry, stemming from the numerous and disparate actors involved.
There are only two conventional armies: the Kurdish fighters and the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.
The opposition comprises factions dependent on foreign sponsors.
Indeed, the “nationalist" opposition is merely an assortment of factions responsible for protecting small territories, and the “Free Syrian Army" is little more than a fantasy.
The stark reality is that the best-organized groups are the jihadists: the Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra, and the Islamic Front.
De Mistura's plan aims to stabilize the situation by shifting the policy focus away from a relentless military campaign – an approach that is benefiting only the Islamic State.
The plan's emphasis on Aleppo – which is not only a commercial hub and Syria's largest city, but also represents a sort of microcosm of the country – distinguishes it from the shaky cease-fires that have been implemented in Homs and elsewhere in the country.
The strategy's main strength is that it is not, in itself, a peace project.
Instead of requiring that any or all factions surrender or relinquish their weapons, it calls only for the cessation of heavy fighting, to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and prevent Aleppo's total collapse.
Such a freeze – guaranteed by an effective enforcement mechanism – would present an important opportunity to make progress in confidence-building.
Recent talks in Cairo and Moscow produced small, but not negligible, steps in that direction.
The objective should be to initiate a productive dialogue – and, ultimately, achieve consensus – among relevant actors.
In this proxy war, no solution will be possible without the agreement of the factions' main sources of support – Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
Likewise, Turkey must not only address the inflow of refugees, security concerns along its border with Syria, and its position as a transit country for jihadists; it must also develop a coherent policy toward the Islamic State that is not subsumed in official anxiety over demands by the country's Kurdish minority.
Other powers will also have a key role to play.
Support by the United States for de Mistura's initiative symbolizes a quiet – and constructive – shift by President Barack Obama's administration from its demand that Assad step down immediately.
The European Union's policy toward Syria, however, remains confused, with member states having managed to agree only to create a “regional trust fund" to address the crisis.
Given the EU's strong interest in a more stable Syria, rooted in its geographical proximity, it is time for European leaders to take an unequivocal stance on Syria.
But a lasting solution to the conflict ultimately comes down to the Syrians.
In fact, the foundations for the kind of Syrian-led political solution that is needed were laid with the 2012 Geneva I Communiqué.
At that time, successive rounds of negotiations failed, owing to an all-or-nothing mentality, based largely on the mistaken assumption that Assad, like Tunisia's Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, would be ousted relatively quickly.
But de Mistura has made it clear that he aims neither to build a lasting peace with Assad nor to establish Assad's departure from power as a precondition for peace.
The solution lies between these two options, and the West – especially Europe – must accept that.
Placing unrealistic demands on a Syrian peace process is a sure route to failure.
Pragmatism is essential, even if it means that some relevant actors, including the EU, have to swallow their pride.
The stability of the region and the lives (and what is left of the livelihoods) of the Syrian people depend on it.

Infrastructure’s Class of Its Own
BEIJING – After several months of disappointing economic indicators, China’s State Council has unveiled a “mini-stimulus” package, focused on social-housing construction and railway expansion.
The decision came a month after Premier Li Keqiang’s declaration that China had set its annual growth target at “around 7.5%” – the same as last year’s goal.
The implication is clear: While consumption-driven growth remains a long-term goal for China, infrastructure will continue – at least in the short term – to serve as a key driver of China’s economy.
Of course, China is not the only economy that depends on infrastructure investment to buttress economic growth.
The World Bank estimates that infrastructure investments accounted for nearly half of the acceleration in Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic growth in 2001-2005.
According to the Bank, a 10% increase in infrastructure investment is associated with GDP growth of 1%.
Such investment also creates jobs, both in the short term, by creating demand for materials and labor, and in the long term, for related services.
For example, every $100 million invested in rural road maintenance translates into an estimated 25,000-50,000 job opportunities.
But these benefits are diluted in China, owing to its excessive reliance on public funding.
Indeed, in recent years, less than 0.03% of Chinese infrastructure investment – which amounted to roughly 9% of GDP – was derived from private capital.
This problem is not limited to China; of the 7.2% of GDP that Asian countries spend, on average, on infrastructure development, only about 0.2% is privately funded.
By contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, private capital finances, respectively, 1.9% and 1.6% of infrastructure investment.
Discussions within the G-20 have produced two possible explanations for Asian countries’ inability to attract more private capital to infrastructure projects.
Most developing countries argue that the problem is rooted in the provision of capital, with investors preferring to fill their infrastructure portfolios with low-risk projects, and insurance companies and banks facing overly restrictive regulations.
OECD countries like Germany counter that the problem is the lack of investment-worthy assets; there are simply not enough bankable projects available.
In fact, both explanations are correct – but neither is complete.
It is time for Asia’s leaders to recognize that the lack of private funding for infrastructure projects cannot be reduced to one or even two problems, and to develop comprehensive solutions that account for the full scope of the challenge.
This requires, first and foremost, abandoning the view that infrastructure assets fit into the paradigm of traditional asset classes like equity, debt, or real estate.
Infrastructure must be redefined as a new asset class, based on several considerations.
For starters, there is the public-good element of many infrastructure projects, which demands contingent government obligations like universal coverage levels for basic services.
In order to make such projects more appealing to private investors, economic externalities should be internalized, and a link should be established between the internal rate of return, which matters to a commercial investor, and the economic rate of return, which matters to society.
Moreover, innovative mechanisms to supply new assets to investors would be needed – and that requires the creativity found and priced by markets.
To this end, private-sector sponsors must be given space to initiate valuable projects.
The new asset class would need its own standardized risk/return profile, accounting, for example, for the political risks that public-sector involvement may imply and for the lower returns from infrastructure relative to traditional private equity.
Moreover, the risks associated with the new asset class would change as projects progress from feasibility study to construction to operation, implying that each phase would attract different sources of funding.
A clear understanding of this process would enable potential investors to assess projects more effectively, which is critical to encouraging them to put up financing.
Another important consideration is the considerable technical expertise that infrastructure investments demand, which makes them more complex than most assets.
Similarly, a specialized network of actors would be needed to ensure that intermediation of infrastructure transactions is efficient and cost-effective, instead of fragmented and slow, as it is now.
For countries that lack China’s strong fiscal position, the need to attract private capital to infrastructure investment is obvious.
With nearly 70% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lacking access to electricity and 65% of South Asians lacking access to basic sanitation, there is no greater imperative than to plan, fund, build, and maintain infrastructure assets.
But private investment in infrastructure remains vital even in countries like China, because it brings the power and dynamism of the market, which improves the allocation of capital and promotes transparency.
Indeed, more private-sector involvement would make the kind of scandals that have occurred in China’s railway sector far less likely.
In short, redefining infrastructure as a new asset class is the only credible way to attract funding for infrastructure construction, and thus to boost long-term economic growth and the employment rate.
It is time for Asia’s leaders to step up.

The Real Side of Fake News
NEW YORK – Today’s digital devices and social networks deliver so much information that even the savviest consumer cannot evaluate all of it.
We seem to be living in a version of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, where truth is drowned in a sea of irrelevance.
But the future need not be the dystopia that the present seems to suggest.
The share of Americans who get their news from social media has grown rapidly in recent years, to 62% as of 2016.
And yet, according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, media, academic, technology, and publishing professionals have increasingly come to view the Internet as a cesspool of hate speech, anger, and trolls.
Much of what arrives on our digital doorstep these days is best described as “fake news”: hoax stories, propaganda, and other forms of misinformation.
But while “fake news” is a useful label for a very real problem, it does not tell us if we are in fact living in a “post-truth” world; and, if so, whom we should hold responsible.
To answer those questions, we need to examine the fake-news infrastructure.
Many of the anonymous political hobbyists and social hackers who are creating and disseminating fake news do so on Reddit.
With around 300 million monthly users globally, Reddit is the fourth most visited website in the US, and eighth in the world, as of this month.
A casual observer who visits Reddit will find what looks like a Web 1.0 message board that is ridden with near-indecipherable jargon and acronyms, such as “HH,” “cucks,” “centipedes,” and “God Emperor of the Internet.”
These are insider code words that did not emerge accidentally.
They respectively refer to “Heil Hitler,” critics of the so-called alt-right, Trump supporters, and, of course, Trump himself.
Despite being wildly popular, Reddit is mentioned in mainstream media coverage only when its most controversial conversations boil over, as occurred in 2008, when a Reddit subpage (or subreddit) called “Jailbait” provided a platform for users to exchange child pornography.
Following a public outcry, Reddit banned the subreddit in 2011, as it did again when the public took notice of a subreddit about stalking women called “CreepShots.”
Still, misogyny and hate speech have continued to flow freely on the site.
In an ugly masquerade of free speech, Reddit has hosted subreddits called “BeatingWomen,” “FatPeopleHate,” and “The Chimpire” (promoting racism).
Most recently, a “Pizzagate” subreddit hosted conspiracy theorists claiming that Hillary Clinton ran a child pornography ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington, DC.
When Edgar Maddison Welch, armed with an AR-15, arrived at the establishment and started firing off rounds, the media finally, but only temporarily, took notice of Reddit’s role in the fake-news phenomenon.
Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, for his part, doesn’t seem to spend much time worrying about the potential dangers posed by his website.
When Ohanian delivered a keynote address at the popular SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, this year, he didn’t talk about the line between free speech and hate speech.
Nor did he mention the infamous subreddit “The_Donald,” which has more than 300,000 registered users, and may have played a critical role in electing Donald Trump.
Instead, he spoke about a Reddit user called “Shitty Watercolour,” and he declared “pseudonymity” to be the hallmark of freedom and uncensored speech.
During an “Ask Me Anything” session after his speech, Ohanian took no questions about Pizzagate, “The_Donald,” or hate speech.
To be sure, Reddit isn’t the only supporter of the kind of online anonymity that allows users to distribute hate speech and fake news without consequences.
And there are those who worry that cleaning up Reddit will only drive the trolls underground to less public sites like Voat.
But while other large online platforms such as Facebook are taking steps to address the problem, Reddit remains defiant.
Reddit’s relative immunity from criticism may help to explain its indifference.
As a top-ten site for US web traffic, it acts as a major conduit for media outlets, which use it to increase their page views, and thus their advertising revenues.
Reddit itself is owned by some familiar names.
Its single largest shareholder is Advance Publications, the parent company of Condé Nast; and its other investors include Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Snoop Dogg, Jared Leto, and Josh Kushner, the brother of White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner.
Sadly, none of these high-profile investors seems to have objected to Reddit’s hosting of subreddits called “WhiteNationalism,” “rapeisfun,” “BurningKids,” “cutefemalecorpses,” and so on.
Fake news is a symptom of a larger problem.
With advertising revenues declining, media organizations are increasingly desperate for clicks.
Most readers do not hesitate to share or re-tweet headlines that support their own biases and beliefs.
And technology companies shrug and claim that they are “just a platform,” while they reap profits from the traffic that fake news brings in.
So, what can news consumers do to push back against fake news?
For starters, we should be demanding that trusted media outlets avoid hosting their content on anonymous sites like Reddit.
And we should apply more pressure on companies like Advance Publications to take responsibility for the sites they own and what happens there.
Above all, that means rolling back the culture of digital anonymity that facilitates hate speech and misinformation.
Digital platforms should require those who espouse ideas and share information to sign their names to their output.
Pseudonyms are for fiction writers.

Ghettoizing Identity
PARIS – Once, as I picked up the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen at his hotel, the receptionist asked me if I was his driver.
After hesitating, I nodded yes.
Among my various identities that day, that of driver was the most obvious to her.
This sense of multiple identities is something that Sen himself highlighted mischievously in his book Identity and Violence : “The same person can be, for example, a British citizen, of Malaysian origin, with Chinese racial characteristics, a stockbroker, a non-vegetarian, an asthmatic, a linguist, a bodybuilder, a poet, an opponent of abortion, a bird-watcher, an astrologer, and one who believes that God invented Darwin to test the gullible.”
Only a minimum of introspection shows that our difficulty in answering the question, Who am I?, arises from the complexity we face in distinguishing between our many identities and understanding their architecture.
Who am I, indeed, and why should I accept people reducing me and the richness of my identity to only one of its dimensions?
Yet such reductionism lies behind one of today’s dominant concepts, multiculturalism, according to which one of our identities must prevail above all others, serving as the sole criterion for organizing society into distinct groups.
Nowadays, we are often told that there are only two ways for people to integrate into a society: the “British” model of cultural pluralism, and the “French” model, based on acceptance of Republican values and, above all, the concept of equality.
According to the conventional wisdom, Britain’s social model is based on coexistence between different communities, with each continuing to observe its conventions and customs while respecting the country’s laws – an informal federation of communities.
But that common wisdom is grossly mistaken, because British law grants immigrants from all the Commonwealth countries something extraordinary: the right to vote in British elections, even national ones.
Citizens know by experience that democracy does not consist in universal suffrage alone, but also requires a public sphere that is equally open to all.
In the United Kingdom, a large group of immigrants thus share with native Britons the right to participate in public debates on all matters of general interest, whether local or national.
Because fundamental equality is granted in this way, the British system manages to cope better than others do with a greater expression of distinctive identities.
Nowadays, however, Britain’s government itself seems to be forgetting the bedrock conditions of this British model by trying to satisfy the desire of particular communities’ for public recognition by officially promoting things like state-subsidized denominational schools.
According to Sen, this is regrettable because it leads to people giving one of their identities – religious, say, or cultural – priority over all others at a time when it is essential that children broaden their intellectual horizons.
By embracing the kind of separatism that such schools represent, the British are now saying, “This is your identity and you can have nothing else.” That approach amounts to communitarianism, not multiculturalism.
In the last few years, the “French model” has also been subjected to misinterpretation, due to confusion about its basis – genuine inclusion in the life of society, which means genuine equality in terms of access to public services, the social welfare system, schools and universities, employment, and so on.
Republicanism grants each individual, regardless of his or her other identities equal rights in order to achieve universal equality.
It does not deny distinctive identities and gives each the right to express itself within the private sphere.
The temptation of communitarianism, which the French have debated for at least a decade, comes from the wish to turn the failure of genuine equality into something positive.
It offers integration by default within the differentiated space of various communities – a sort of imprisonment by civilization, Sen would say.
But you cannot dress up failure in the clothes of success.
As long as urban areas are socially and economically deprived, communitarianism will only serve to mask the violation of the principle of equality.
Social groups are then measured in terms of their “ethnic” or “racial” differences.
Because the social conditions of the “French model” have been so neglected, the model is now a living contradiction of its core principle: equality.
To reverse the trend, French republicanism must, like English multiculturalism, contradict itself in order to fulfil itself.
The French must recognize that equality before the law is a core principle, but a weak one; it needs to be complemented by a stricter vision of how to achieve equality.
This vision should make republican efforts proportional to the importance of people’s handicap in order to free them from the burden of their initial conditions.
Genuine equality in the public sphere – which differs according to the values and history of each country – implies a minimal level of acceptance of a country’s history and values.
Sen says that what is being accepted here should be thought of as national identity.
But this identity must be open.
It is an identity we share by living together and by what we have in common, whatever the differences between our multiples identities.
The great British novelist Joseph Conrad, born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski to Polish parents in Russian-ruled Ukraine, said that words are the biggest enemy of reality.
The appeal of “national identity” must not be turned into a collective smokescreen behind which inclusion becomes a disembodied dream coexisting with the communitarianism that is now emerging from its failure.

Unsettling America
LONDON – Is there more to be said about Egypt?
Hosni Mubarak has been sacrificed to save the military regime.
A “strongman” who cannot keep order in the streets is of no use to anyone.
Whether “democracy” will ensue is much more dubious.
Judging on the basis of Pakistan, and much of the rest of the Muslim world, periods of (corrupt) civilian rule will alternate with “cleansing” military coups.
I doubt that most Egyptians put what we call democracy at the top of their political agenda.
Journalists who claim otherwise are not a representative sample, even in Western countries.
They are a restless breed, flitting round the world’s trouble spots, pen and camera poised.
Freedom of expression is in their bones; mass protests their visual lifeblood.
They try to report the world as it is, but theirs is not the world of most people – their business depends on the disruption of “ordinary” business, so they systematically underestimate people’s desire for law and order (or at least order).
Most people, it seems, will tolerate a modest amount of political repression, including secret police, torture, and corruption, if it delivers security and a modicum of prosperity and fairness.
Otherwise, there is no explanation for the longevity of dictatorships such as Mubarak’s 30-year rule. Likewise, in the referendum that ended his 16-year rule in Chile in 1990, General Augusto Pinochet, with thousands of tortured and vanished victims in his grisly cupboard, ran on a law-and-order platform and received 44% of the vote.
Most Western leaders think naturally in terms of a “transition to democracy.”
This is what they want to happen in Egypt, hoping that democracy will not jeopardize Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel.
But Western democracies’ combination of freedom and order – the West’s most precious gift to the world – is the product of a long history that cannot be replicated in short order.
Non-Western political systems are typically archaic: good rulers can sleep soundly at night, while bad rulers face continual danger of overthrow from the army or the streets.
Most non-Western peoples rely upon the ruler’s personal virtues, not institutional limits on his power, to make their lives tolerable.
We interpret as striving for democracy what is really the traditional way of getting rid of bad rulers.
Yet all of this leaves out the possibility of change, particularly change influenced by the United States’ unsettling role in the world.
The idea that the US is a status quo power is a delusion of international-relations experts.
In the short run, of course, the US behaves like an ordinary power.
It has interests to protect, and this often requires supporting unsavory regimes.
But America’s long-term project is to remake the world in its image.
Where America has room for maneuver, it always presses forward in this direction.
And, despite the rise of China and the move to a more “plural” international system, the US still has the power to change “facts on the ground” in large parts of the world, particularly the Middle East.
Experts have always underestimated the expansionary character of American foreign policy, because they think of expansion in old-world terms: conquest, imperialism, and colonialism.
The US does not seek to create an empire in the old sense: America pursues an imperialism of the values that it holds dear.
If all countries have the same values, traditional imperialism becomes obsolete.
Though it clearly lacks the power to impose its values by force, the US certainly has the power to unsettle established conditions, both through the attraction of its “soft power” (the American way of life) and by the exemplary use of force.
I was one of those who opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Now I wonder whether I was right.
Parts of the invasion and occupation were certainly badly mishandled by the US, leading to a much greater loss of life than was necessary.
But, taking the long view, can anyone doubt that the invasion had the effect of shaking up the pieces, not just in Iraq, but across the Islamic chessboard?
That is why I am not at all sure that the street uprisings in Egypt, following those in Tunisia, and now spreading to other Muslim-majority countries, can be interpreted simply as traditional forms of protest against bad rulers.
Throughout the Muslim world, there is a sense of enlarged possibilities, especially among the young: more than half of Egypt’s 80 million people are under 25.
Surely, this sentiment can be traced back to the US invasion and forcible overthrow of Saddam Hussein.
In his great verse drama Faust, Goethe has God send humanity the Devil (Mephistopheles) in order to stir things up.
His intention is quite clear: “Man’s active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level; Unqualified repose he learns to crave, Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave, Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.”
Mephistopheles is rather a joker.
So is America, always stirring sleepy societies out of their torpor – a role begun when Commodore Matthew Perry “opened up” Japan in 1854.
If we want to hold fast to any vision of progress, this is an indispensable role, and only America can play it today.
With China, like seeks to talk to like.
With America, like deliberately engages with unlike, and tries to infuse it with some of its vigor.
True, America’s intervention in the Middle East also strengthened extremist Islam, breeding on the resentment that the US presence arouses.
But, taking the long view, the future surely does not lie with organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood. The religious demon is a far less appealing devil than Uncle Sam.
Sooner or later, the Brothers will suffer the fate of all bad devils.

The Health Benefits of Fighting Climate Change
LIMA – Governments often see climate change as too costly to address.
In fact, it is too costly to ignore.
That is why the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, has linked the prevention of disastrous climate change to “immediate health benefits and health cost savings” from the reduction of air pollution.
The statistics are grim.
Air pollution caused more than seven million premature deaths – one in eight globally – in 2012, compared to nearly six million premature deaths from tobacco.
One of the biggest causes of harm are the fine particles called PM2.5, with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers.
They wreak havoc by traveling deep into the lungs, contributing to inflammation, cancer, and respiratory infection, or by passing into the bloodstream, where they can trigger changes in blood vessels that cause heart attacks and strokes.
The combustion of diesel and coal are among the main causes of air pollution, with 3.7 million deaths attributed to outdoor fumes and 4.3 million resulting from poorly ventilated homes.
Motorized transport now accounts for half of premature deaths from ambient particulate matter in the 34 OECD countries.
Coal-fired power is also the main source of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change, which causes about 150,000 premature deaths annually and threatens pervasive risks this century and beyond.
To be sure, the coal industry has helped billions of people escape poverty, not least in China, where coal-fired power has underpinned the nearly 700% growth in per capita income since 1990.
But human health is at greater risk in countries that burn more coal.
Research for the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate last year calculated that particulate matter alone caused 1.23 million premature deaths in China – the world’s top coal-consuming economy – in 2010.
Estimates for 2012 suggest that 88% of air-pollution-related deaths occur in low- to middle-income countries, representing 82% of the world’s population.
The Western Pacific and Southeast Asian regions bear the burden of 1.67 million and 936,000 deaths, respectively.
But pollution is worsening and taking lives in high-income countries as well.
For example, PM2.5 reduces life expectancy across the European Union by eight months and, together with ozone, was responsible for 430,000 premature deaths in the EU’s 28 member states in 2011.
In Britain, more than six decades after the Great Smog of 1952, PM2.5 pollution levels still persistently exceed WHO guidelines.
The health costs of air pollution in the EU are up to €940 billion annually.
The WHO recently carried out a review of the evidence on the health effects of air pollution, and found that the range of such effects is broader and occur at lower concentrations than previously thought.
In addition to the well-known effects of air pollution on the lungs and heart, new evidence points to its detrimental impact on children’s development, including in utero.
Some studies even link air pollution to diabetes, a major chronic disease and health challenge in Indonesia, China, and Western countries.
Despite the overwhelming evidence of health risks, many countries routinely ignore air-quality standards – as well as the emissions monitoring needed for effective regional cooperation – mainly owing to governments’ fear of their economic impact.
Economic models used by advisers to shape development strategy – and touted by lobbyists to influence decisions on major infrastructure projects – exclude the human cost of air pollution and the long-term benefits of measures to reduce it.
Any solutions to the problems posed by air pollution will require not only new economic models, but also integrated measures by local, national, and international governments.
Cutting emissions from urban transport, for example, will involve city mayors, local planners, and national policymakers working together to induce compact development.
Fortunately, government support for effective action is growing.
Air pollution is at the top of China’s domestic agenda, following the choking smog dubbed “airpocalypse” that engulfed its major cities in January 2013 and Chai Jing’s recent documentary (and social-media phenomenon) “Under the Dome,” which exposed the catastrophic health impacts of air pollution.
Indeed, China’s government has closed some of the country’s dirtiest power plants, resulting in a drop in coal consumption last year for the first time since 1998.
A recent draft resolution on air pollution and health for the World Health Assembly (the WHO’s governing body) suggests that countries should “underscore” a link between air pollution and climate change.
Countries should adopt the WHO air-quality guidelines and highlight additional opportunities for greener urban planning, cleaner energy, more efficient buildings, and safer walking and cycling.
A formal acknowledgement by governments of the immediate health-related benefits of cutting carbon-dioxide emissions can tip the scales toward greater progress on climate change, air pollution, and human health simultaneously.
Policymakers everywhere should recognize the economic opportunities – and the political benefits – that such an outcome promises to deliver.

The Negative Rates Club
BRUSSELS – For the better part of a decade, central banks have been making only limited headway in curbing powerful global deflationary forces.
Since 2008, the US Federal Reserve has maintained zero interest rates, while pursuing multiple waves of unprecedented balance-sheet expansion through large-scale bond purchases.
The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank have followed suit, each with its own version of so-called “quantitative easing” (QE).
Yet inflation has not picked up appreciably anywhere.
Despite their shared struggles with deflationary pressures, these countries’ monetary policies – and economic performance – are now diverging.
Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom are now growing strongly enough to exit their expansionary policies and raise interest rates, the eurozone and Japan are doubling down on QE, pushing policy long-term interest rates further into negative territory.
What explains this difference?
The short answer is debt.
The US and the UK have been running current-account deficits for decades, and are thus debtors, while the eurozone and Japan have been running external surpluses, making them creditors.
Because negative rates benefit debtors and harm creditors, introducing them after the global economic crisis spurred a recovery in the US and the UK, but had little effect in the eurozone and Japan.
This is not an isolated phenomenon.
By now, most of the world’s creditor countries – those with large and persistent current-account surpluses, such as Denmark and Switzerland – have negative interest rates, not only for long-term governments bonds and other “riskless” debt, but also for medium-term maturities.
And it is doing little good.
Despite the weak impact of low interest rates, central banks in these economies remain committed to them.
If it is suggested that QE or lower interest rates are unlikely to benefit their economies much, they shift the focus of the discussion, railing against the notion that raising interest rates would stimulate the economy – an ostensibly airtight argument.
Only it is actually far from airtight.
Basic economics courses cover the curious case of the “backward-bending supply curve of savings”: In some circumstances, lower interest rates can lead to higher savings.
Because lower rates reduce savers’ income, they spend less, especially if they have a savings target for their retirement.
None of this discredits the general rule – which forms the basis of modern monetary policymaking – that a lower interest rate tends to stimulate consumption and other expenditure.
The impact simply varies according to the economy’s debt position.
In a closed economy, there is a debtor for every creditor, so whatever creditors lose from ultra-low interest rates, debtors should gain.
But in an economy with a large net-foreign-asset position, there are naturally more creditors than debtors.
For a country with large foreign debts, the opposite is true.
The effectiveness of monetary policy at the lower bound should thus be different in creditor and debtor economies.
Until recently, this condition did not matter, because foreign-asset positions were usually small (as a percentage of GDP).
Today, however, these positions in the major industrial economies are large and increasingly divergent, partly owing to the buildup of leverage that led to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
And, in fact, at the international level, leverage is continuing to grow.
Though current-account imbalances have generally fallen since the financial crisis began, they have not reversed.
This implies that the surplus countries continue to strengthen their creditor positions, diverging from the deficit economies.
Commodity exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, which ran large current-account surpluses when oil prices were high, are the main exception to this pattern of diverging foreign-asset positions.
With the precipitous decline in world oil prices since June 2014, their fortunes have reversed.
Their export earnings have plummeted – falling by half in many cases – forcing them to run deficits and draw on the large sovereign-wealth funds they accumulated during the global commodity boom.
A radical reduction in expenditure has now become unavoidable.
The industrialized economies face very different challenges.
Their problem – in a sense, a luxury problem – is to ensure that their consumers spend the windfall from lower import prices.
But in the creditor countries, negative rates do not seem to advance this goal; indeed, some external surpluses are even increasing.
This divergence is also playing out within the eurozone.
Though it is a creditor economy overall, it comprises debtor countries as well.
The debtor economies, such as Spain and Portugal, now run small current-account surpluses, and are gradually reducing their debt.
But the traditional creditors have seen their current-account surpluses grow so much that the debtor/creditor asymmetry continues to increase.
Most notably, since the start of the financial crisis, Germany's current-account surplus has increased to nearly 8% of GDP, meaning that the country has accumulated more surpluses in that period than in its entire previous history.
On current trends, the German creditor position might rise from 60% of GDP to 100% of GDP.
Central bankers are supposed to be patient.
Indeed, economists supported the global movement toward central-bank independence precisely because it seemed that central bankers would be less inclined to try to stimulate the economy for short-term gain.
But central bankers seem to have become impatient, fretting about low inflation, even though the output gap is slowly closing and full employment has been reached in the US and Japan.
Creditor countries’ central bankers must stop trying to manipulate their economies with more potentially counterproductive monetary easing.
Instead, they should allow the recovery to run its course, even if that happens slowly, and wait for the base effect of lower oil prices to disappear.
ECB President Mario Draghi recently admitted that, in today’s global context, the current monetary-policy approach might not be effective.
But promising more of the same is not the answer.

Time for a Great Reset
GENEVA – COVID-19 lockdowns may be gradually easing, but anxiety about the world’s social and economic prospects is only intensifying.
There is good reason to worry: a sharp economic downturn has already begun, and we could be facing the worst depression since the 1930s.
But, while this outcome is likely, it is not unavoidable.
To achieve a better outcome, the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions.
Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed.
In short, we need a “Great Reset” of capitalism.
There are many reasons to pursue a Great Reset, but the most urgent is COVID-19.
Having already led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, the pandemic represents one of the worst public-health crises in recent history.
And, with casualties still mounting in many parts of the world, it is far from over.
This will have serious long-term consequences for economic growth, public debt, employment, and human wellbeing.
According to the Financial Times, global government debt has already reached its highest level in peacetime.
Moreover, unemployment is skyrocketing in many countries: in the US, for example, one in four workers have filed for unemployment since mid-March, with new weekly claims far above historic highs.
The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to shrink by 3% this year – a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points in just four months.
All of this will exacerbate the climate and social crises that were already underway.
Some countries have already used the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to weaken environmental protections and enforcement.
And frustrations over social ills like rising inequality – US billionaires’ combined wealth has increased during the crisis – are intensifying.
Left unaddressed, these crises, together with COVID-19, will deepen and leave the world even less sustainable, less equal, and more fragile.
Incremental measures and ad hoc fixes will not suffice to prevent this scenario.
We must build entirely new foundations for our economic and social systems.
The level of cooperation and ambition this implies is unprecedented.
But it is not some impossible dream.
In fact, one silver lining of the pandemic is that it has shown how quickly we can make radical changes to our lifestyles.
Almost instantly, the crisis forced businesses and individuals to abandon practices long claimed to be essential, from frequent air travel to working in an office.
Likewise, populations have overwhelmingly shown a willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of health-care and other essential workers and vulnerable populations, such as the elderly.
And many companies have stepped up to support their workers, customers, and local communities, in a shift toward the kind of stakeholder capitalism to which they had previously paid lip service.
Clearly, the will to build a better society does exist.
We must use it to secure the Great Reset that we so badly need.
That will require stronger and more effective governments, though this does not imply an ideological push for bigger ones.
And it will demand private-sector engagement every step of the way.
The Great Reset agenda would have three main components.
The first would steer the market toward fairer outcomes.
To this end, governments should improve coordination (for example, in tax, regulatory, and fiscal policy), upgrade trade arrangements, and create the conditions for a “stakeholder economy.”
At a time of diminishing tax bases and soaring public debt, governments have a powerful incentive to pursue such action.
Moreover, governments should implement long-overdue reforms that promote more equitable outcomes.
Depending on the country, these may include changes to wealth taxes, the withdrawal of fossil-fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade, and competition.
The second component of a Great Reset agenda would ensure that investments advance shared goals, such as equality and sustainability.
Here, the large-scale spending programs that many governments are implementing represent a major opportunity for progress.
The European Commission, for one, has unveiled plans for a €750 billion ($838 billion) recovery fund.
The US, China, and Japan also have ambitious economic-stimulus plans.
Rather than using these funds, as well as investments from private entities and pension funds, to fill cracks in the old system, we should use them to create a new one that is more resilient, equitable, and sustainable in the long run.
This means, for example, building “green” urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries to improve their track record on environmental, social, and governance metrics.
The third and final priority of a Great Reset agenda is to harness the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to support the public good, especially by addressing health and social challenges.
During the COVID-19 crisis, companies, universities, and others have joined forces to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and possible vaccines; establish testing centers; create mechanisms for tracing infections; and deliver telemedicine.
Imagine what could be possible if similar concerted efforts were made in every sector.
The COVID-19 crisis is affecting every facet of people’s lives in every corner of the world.
But tragedy need not be its only legacy.
On the contrary, the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world to create a healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous future.

Finishing Off Malaria
JEDDAH – Malaria has long been one of the major killer diseases of our age.
World Health Organization data show that as much as half of the world’s population is at risk.
But roughly 90% of malaria cases and 92% of malaria deaths take place in just one region: Sub-Saharan Africa.
Europe and North America live completely free of malaria.
But children in Sub-Saharan Africa often suffer through multiple bouts of the disease before they reach the age of five.
And children below the age of five account for 70% of malaria-related deaths.
Pregnant women who contract the disease can suffer serious health complications.
The good news is that the fight against malaria has lately gained momentum, with infections falling steadily in most places and malaria-related deaths down by 29% since 2010.
Progress can be attributed partly to innovations, including new rapid diagnostic tests that work in just minutes, more accessible and affordable anti-malarial drugs, and rising use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs).
Greater community engagement has also helped, with popular musicians, media organizations, and religious leaders advocating for stronger action against malaria.
Senegal is one of the countries leading the decline in cases.
Nearly 86% of the population now uses LLINs, and most people have access to rapid diagnostic tests, as well as artemisinin-based combination therapy, which is provided for free by the government and donors.
Community health workers, under the direction of an effective national program led by the country’s health minister, Awa Marie Coll-Seck, have played a pivotal role in enabling progress.
The results are impressive.
In 2001, nearly 36% of outpatient visits in Senegal were malaria-related.
According to the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), that figure stood at just 3.3% last year.
Over the same period, malaria-related deaths fell from nearly 30% to just above 2%.
The US-based Centers for Disease Control reports that, from 2008 to 2010, the number of children under the age of five infected with malaria dropped by 50%.
Senegal is hoping to achieve pre-elimination (defined by the NMCP as fewer than five cases per 1,000 people annually) by 2020, with the WHO certifying malaria as fully eliminated from the country by 2030.
But getting there will not be easy.
Senegal will need more resources, a stronger government commitment, increased support from development partners, and greater community involvement.
Against this background, the Lives and Livelihoods Fund (LLF) – a grant facility launched by the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation – has joined Senegal’s fight against malaria.
The LLF combines $500 million from donors – including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, the Qatar Fund for Development, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, and the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development (ISFD) – with $2 billion of IsDB financing for health, agriculture, and rural infrastructure projects.
Administered by the IsDB, the LLF is the biggest initiative of its kind based in the Middle East, aiming to increase the resources available for development across the 30 least-developed and lower-middle-income countries in the Muslim world.
One of the LLF’s first projects will be a $32 million malaria pre-elimination project in Senegal.
The LLF’s governance mechanism, the Impact Committee (of which I am an alternate member, representing ISFD), approved the year-one pipeline last September.
The Senegalese government officially agreed to the project – a scaled-up version of the already-successful NMCP – in February.
As a result, 25 districts in five regions of Senegal will be helped in achieving malaria pre-elimination, directly or indirectly benefiting nearly four million people (about 25% of Senegal’s total population).
I recently traveled to Senegal to assess the project’s progress.
The other Impact Committee members and I met with Coll-Seck and other national leaders, who affirmed the project’s importance.
The most moving part of the trip was our visit to the Deggo health post, in the suburbs of Dakar, where health workers and community volunteers explained to us their ongoing efforts to fight the disease.
We left that meeting confident that the project possesses both the right skills and the needed commitment to succeed.
Investments in combating malaria, like those by the LLF, are among the most cost-effective health interventions, yielding broad socioeconomic benefits.
A healthy child is more likely to attend school, resulting in improved learning outcomes, just as a healthy adult can earn a steady income, resulting in reduced poverty and hunger.
Healthy workers are more productive, boosting economic output.
Malaria-free communities can divert their health budgets to fight other scourges, such as non-communicable or neglected tropical diseases.
Progress in the fight against malaria will mean progress toward several Sustainable Development Goals (the United Nations targets to which world leaders agreed in 2015), from eliminating poverty to ending preventable deaths in children under age five.
If we are to win the fight, more financing from funds like the LLF, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, is the way to do it.

Lessons from Japan's Economic Malaise
Japan's economy has been in a state of malaise--slow growth alternating with recession--for over a decade, with intense debate meeting policy vacillation.
Some, for instance, prescribe budget deficits to stimulate the economy; others, remembering the Clinton Administration's claim that fiscal consolidation underpinned the US recovery in 1993, argue for deficit reduction.
Similarly, some argue that the country needs a mild dose of inflation, while Japan's central bank continues to resist the very idea that inflation could ameliorate any economic problem.
Confusion about what cure to prescribe is caused in part by the fact that different medicines are suited for different problems, whereas much of the policy debate fails to distinguish among them adequately.
As one of President Clinton's economic advisers during the critical period of America's economic recovery, I feel obligated to point out that circumstances in the US in the early 1990's were unique.
Normally, deficit reduction in an economic downturn makes a downturn worse--just as the British economist John Maynard Keynes demonstrated 70 years ago.
Indeed, thanks to the IMF, we have had ample opportunity to see what happens, both in East Asia and Latin America, when an economy in a downturn tries to balance its budget.
The reason deficit reduction worked in the US in 1993 was that America's banks, whose balance sheets were weak, had large holdings of long-term bonds, the value of which increased as long-term interest rates fell.
The fall in interest rates, which spurred business investment, was in part due to the long-term deficit reduction strategy.
Today, Japan faces a problem of deflation, not inflation.
During the Great Depression, the great American economist Irving Fisher focused on the adverse effects of falling prices.
My own work, with Bruce Greenwald of Columbia University, updates these theories, taking into account the imperfections of capital markets, especially those associated with asymmetries of information.
Keynes worried about price rigidities--the failure of prices and wages to fall when there is excess supply of labor or goods.
Keynes' colleague at Cambridge University, A.C. Pigou, voiced the standard theory of the time: if wages and prices fell sufficiently, then consumers with money would eventually feel well enough off (given how cheap everything had become) that they would start to spend, rejuvenating the economy.
Keynes famously retorted that in the long run we are all dead.
Fisher's criticism, however, was even more devastating--and more relevant to Japan's current circumstances: as prices fall, debtors, whose obligations are fixed in nominal terms (that is, in terms of yen) find it increasingly difficult to repay what they owe.
In real terms, they are forced to pay back more and more to their creditors.
Some debtors default--the debtor problems then become the banks' problem--while others are forced to cut back their expenditures, deepening the downturn.
Falling prices also mean that even when the nominal interest rate is very low, the real interest rate, taking into account the deflation, may be significantly higher, so investment, too, is discouraged.
In short, falling prices worsen the economy's situation in the short run.
How can Japan's deflation be reversed?
Assume that the Japanese government financed its deficit partly by printing money rather than borrowing.
Some individuals and firms who receive this money might simply hold on to the newly minted yen, but others might choose to spend it on goods and services, thereby stimulating the economy.
Similarly, higher deposits might simply add to some banks' excess liquidity, but others might find it attractive to lend more, providing a further economic boost.
A carefully paced program could add enough to aggregate demand to pick up the slack in the economy, and reverse deflation, setting into motion a virtuous cycle.
Higher prices would make debtors better off, and they might as a result begin to spend more.
More debtors would be able to repay their loans, which might lead the banks to lend more.
Meanwhile, the yen would weaken, helping exports, and even if the real exchange rate did not change much, given Japan's position as a major creditor, the yen value of its foreign holdings would increase, providing still more economic stimulus.
Of course, those infected with inflation paranoia might worry: won't such a policy simply lead to an inflationary spiral?
There is no economic research that supports such worries.
For countries with low to moderate inflation, moderate increases in inflation do not lead to runaway inflation, regardless of what central bankers may say on the matter.
To be sure, if Japan's government started printing money recklessly--as some countries have done in the past--such worries would be well grounded.
But the Japanese government has shown a remarkable record of fiscal responsibility, and could even calibrate the fraction of the deficit financed by issuing money.
What would be the impact on confidence in the Japanese economy of such fiscal stimulus?
There is nothing that undermines confidence in an economy so much as recessions; and there is nothing that undermines confidence in a government's ability to manage the economy so much as ongoing failure to address either the extremes of inflation or persistent stagnation.
Restoring growth would be good for Japan, good for Asia, and good for the world economy.
Perhaps more importantly, the lessons gleaned from a policy of determined stimulus would be invaluable for other countries facing similar problems.

Elections Are Venezuela's Last Chance
Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate.
President Hugo Chávez clings to power despite the obvious failings of his government: severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization.
The opposition, tainted by their botched coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Chávez from office through a costly general strike.
Both sides justify their intransigence with one-sided interpretations.
His sympathizers glorify Chávez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish, coup-plotting elite.
His fiercest opponents demonize Chávez as an autocrat pursuing a Cuban-style revolution and destroying democracy.
Both interpretations are flawed.
The Chávez government has not helped Venezuela's poor in any significant way.
On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors, inciting economic decline and boosting unemployment and poverty.
Now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor.
The opposition comprises most of Venezuela's organized civil society, not only business, but also trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs.
So Venezuela's polarization does not pit "the poor" against "the oligarchy," but a populist against civil society.
The opposition's view--shared by rightists in the Bush administration--is equally unconvincing. Rather than initiating a revolution, Chávez merely spouts fiery rhetoric.
While his democratic credentials are dubious, he has not acted in an openly authoritarian fashion.
True, he has systematically concentrated power in his own hands and has undermined governmental checks and balances.
But while harassing the opposition, he has not overturned the minimal principles of democracy.
Indeed, he now invokes his formal democratic legitimacy to fend off demands for his resignation.
But Chávez's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical.
Four years ago, Chávez deviated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to engineer a new one, tailor-made for him.
Now he invokes that charter to block calls for a plebiscite on his continuation in office.
The paradox here is that Chávez's earlier example may provide the solution to today's standoff.
As Chávez used para-constitutional means to advance a desire for change in 1999, so the international community should not be confined by the present constitution in pressing to resolve a crisis that is ruining the country.
In fact, the Latin American members of the "group of friendly nations" trying to mediate this conflict can draw on interesting experiences to design such a solution.
After all, confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America's rigid presidential systems.
When chief executives with fixed terms of office lose political support, they cannot be removed through a no-confidence vote, as in parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems therefore risk lengthy stand-offs that threaten democracy--as in Venezuela today.
But over the last decade, Latin American politicians have made presidential systems more flexible by finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents.
One of Chávez's discredited predecessors was impeached on flimsy charges of malfeasance; Ecuador's Congress declared a disastrous chief executive "mentally incompetent"; in Peru, an autocratic president, after months of domestic and international pressure, was forced into exile.
While politicians interpreted the law with a good deal of creativity in these instances, they usually did so to ensure the survival of fragile democracies facing a crisis.
As long as these maneuvers do not proliferate and turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment, they may provide a safety valve for presidential systems.
International monitoring can also safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms.
It is to be hoped that the group of friendly nations can help design an innovative solution to Venezuela's standoff.
To be acceptable to both sides, such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each.
The opposition prefers an "up-or-down" vote on Chávez's continuation in office, which it would most likely win--and which Chávez will never accept.
Chávez insists on the recall referendum mechanism included in his constitution, which the opposition cannot tolerate: removing the president in this way would require a larger absolute number of votes than Chávez garnered in the last election.
But rising abstention makes this virtually impossible.
Both proposals are thus politically unfeasible.
Only a democratic mechanism for conflict resolution that has an uncertain outcome has any chance of being adopted.
That mechanism is an election, to be held as soon as possible (realistically, by this summer).
Both sides will have to work hard if they want to win.
The fractious opposition will need to go beyond rejection of Chávez, elaborate a program for the country's reconstruction, and unite behind an attractive candidate.
President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian Revolution."
Since Chávez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition so far lacks unity, he will have a realistic chance of winning--which should make a new contest acceptable to him.
Pressure from the group of friendly nations may induce both sides to accept this last chance to avoid a political and economic meltdown.
Elections can be made legitimate through a constitutional amendment shortening the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort.
Since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis, it would not become a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin America's democratically elected governments.
An election now in Venezuela will save, not undermine, democracy.

Sanctions and Solidarity
BRUSSELS – The European Union has finally agreed on its “third-level sanctions” against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
As is usual for the EU, arriving at this point has been a long and difficult process.
A key problem all along has been that, though sanctions serve a common purpose, the costs of implementing them are borne by individual member states.
Moreover, the costs are very concrete and visible, as jobs in enterprises that depend on exports to Russia seem to be at stake.
So it was not surprising that many member states were more concerned about the potential cost of the sanctions on their economies than they were about the overall foreign-policy goal of signaling to Russia that its disregard of international law and norms has consequences.
That is why a common fund to provide compensation for the economic costs of sanctions should be an integral part of the EU’s emerging foreign-policy stance toward Russia.
Creating such a fund would provide a potent symbol of solidarity within the EU, while providing an ideal opportunity to reflect on the nature of the sanctions’ costs.
From an economist’s perspective, a key point is that losing export sales does not represent a cost per se.
For example, if a company that produces a generic consumer good like food, or even cars, sells less in Russia than it did before, one should not necessarily count the reduction as a loss.
After all, if such goods have a global market, a loss of sales in one market can be compensated by higher sales in another.
In fact, a large proportion of Russian imports from the EU are precisely of these generic consumer goods, which are not affected by sanctions.
Thus, reports claiming that sanctions imply a high cost – because EU exports to Russia amounted to €120 billion ($161 billion) last year and represent tens of thousands of jobs – are highly misleading.
An economic loss arises only if a firm produces some specialized good that can be sold only in Russia using labor and capital that are also specialized and cannot be employed to produce something else.
This applies especially to Germany: The famous German Mittelstand often does produce highly specialized goods; but it also prides itself on its flexibility and adaptability.
Given this, there might be a case for compensation in some cases, but it should be strictly limited in time.
It would not be difficult to develop objective criteria for access to an EU “Sanctions Compensation Fund.”
A firm could be eligible for compensation if it operated in the sectors covered by sanctions, and if the product in question had special characteristics that prevented sales from being redirected elsewhere.
A quantitative test of eligibility could be that sales to Russia over the previous three years accounted for more than one-quarter of total sales and diminished by more than a certain percentage this year.
Compensation would take the form of retraining programs for personnel, and maybe refinancing of loans taken to finance specialized machinery.
But there are two sectors in which no compensation is needed: energy and finance.
Why?
For starters, the risk to Europe’s energy imports from Russia is negligible.
Should Russia demand a higher price for its oil, Europe could simply turn to the global market.
Likewise, Russian gas giant Gazprom could increase the price it charges its European customers only by breaking existing contracts.
Moreover, Europe is the only customer for a large share of Russian gas exports, which, at least in the short run, must be transported through the existing pipelines.
Given this, the case for compensation in the energy sector is exceptionally weak.
Only the makers of highly specialized equipment, perhaps for exploration under Siberian conditions, might have grounds for drawing on the compensation fund.
The case for compensation is even weaker in the European financial sector.
Providing the kind of medium- to long-term financing that is now subject to sanctions constitutes an infinitesimal fraction of European banks’ business.
Moreover, as Russia’s political system becomes ever more oppressive, and its legal system ever more arbitrary, rich Russians will be more inclined than they already are to establish a safe base abroad for their wealth and families.
The freedom and rule of law provided by financial centers such as London will become even more attractive.
In 2006, the EU established a “Globalization Adjustment Fund” to cushion those sectors hardest hit by rising imports. Though the Fund initially was allocated only €500 million, a rather modest sum compared to the overall annual EU budget of around €100 billion, its creation was an important signal of the EU’s readiness to compensate those who lose out from a common policy.
A similar political signal is needed today to overcome EU member states’ resistance to decisions that advance a common foreign policy. Here, too, the sum needed would probably be rather small compared to the overall EU budget.

Is Globalization the Only Way to Develop?
A US Treasury official recently "urged Mexico's government to work harder to reduce violent crime, saying the country's high crime rate could frighten away foreign investors." An off-the-cuff remark, perhaps, but it shows how foreign trade and investment are seen as the yardsticks for evaluating developing countries.
Development strategy, indeed, is becoming hostage to the idea of integration into the world economy.
This equation is too facile.
Openness to trade is presented as the most potent force for economic growth, yet integration into the world economy has demanding institutional prerequisites, which are not met cheaply.
It would cost a typical developing country $150 million - a sum equal to a year's development budget in many poor countries - to implement the reforms required under WTO agreements.
Although countries benefit from strengthening their institutions in relevant areas, the reality, according to Michael Finger, who calculated these figures, is that "WTO obligations reflect little awareness of development problems." Integration has other, more subtle, institutional requirements as well.
Openness implies heightened exposure to external risk, and thus greater demand for social insurance.
So, in the real world opening up is not simply a matter of letting barriers down.
You must ensure that you abide by international rules of propriety, covering newly exposed domestic sources of weaknesses, and protecting yourself from the elements.
None of the institutional reforms needed for insertion in the world economy are bad; in fact, many are independently desirable.
But recognize the argument favoring openness for what it is: trickle-down institutional reform.
Reforms may or may not trickle down; even when they do, they will rarely constitute the most effective way of targeting the desired ends (whether those ends are legal reform, observance of human rights, or reduced corruption).
Investing in the prerequisites of trade and financial openness as the first order of business in development not only forecloses alternatives, it crowds out possibly urgent priorities by diverting human resources, administrative capabilities, and political capital.
Consider some tradeoffs:
Education.
What should a government's priorities be in its education budget?
Should it train more bank auditors and accountants, even if it means fewer secondary-school teachers?
Corruption.
How should a government focus its anti-corruption strategy?
Should it target the "grand" corruption that foreign investors complain about, or the petty corruption that affects the average person the most?
Legal reform.
Should a government focus its energies on "importing" legal codes and standards, or on improving existing domestic legal institutions?
Public health.
Should a government pursue tough policies on compulsory licensing and/or parallel importation of basic medicines, even if that means running breaking WTO rules?
Industrial strategy.
Should a government simply open up and let the chips drop wherever they might, or emulate East Asia's experience before the 1990s, with industrial policies such as export subsidies, directed credit, and selective protection?
Social protection and safety nets.
How much can a government afford to spend on such programs in view of the fiscal constraints imposed by market "discipline?"
In each area, a strategy tilted toward global integration precludes other paths that could be more development-friendly.
Of course, none of this would be bad if openness were the key to growth.
Alas, evidence for a link between a country's trade barriers and its growth rate is weak.
The appropriate conclusion is not that trade protection is preferable to trade liberalization, because there is no evidence that trade protection systematically promotes higher growth.
But don't oversell the benefits of trade openness.
When useful policy objectives compete for scarce administrative resources and political capital, trade liberalization often does not deserve the priority it typically receives in development strategies.
This lesson is of real importance to countries (such as in Africa) in the early stages of reform.
My conclusion is that openness is not an adequate substitute for a development strategy.
Policymakers must evaluate globalization in terms of developmental needs, not vice versa.
Any economist who appears to question the benefits of trade openness risks banishment, so let me be clear: I do not question the standard version of the gains-from-trade theory, but the extravagant, unsubstantiated claims made about the consequences of openness.
For the latter endangers broad public acceptance of the real article because it unleashes expectations unlikely to be fulfilled.
In the real world, opening up is not a simple matter of revising tariff codes and removing barriers to foreign investment. It requires a heavy dose of institutional reform, which consumes financial, bureaucratic, and political resources.
While many institutional reforms are development-friendly, they may not be targeted at key developmental goals - growth, improved governance, industrial and technological capability, poverty alleviation - and occasionally divert attention from them.
Institutional reforms aimed at maximizing trade and capital flows may produce broad benefits, but they are not necessarily the most effective way of fostering development.
Strategic use of international trade and capital flows is part of a development strategy; it should not be a substitute for it.

The ECB’s Changing of the Guard
LONDON – This month, the European Central Bank hosted a colloquium in honor of Peter Praet, its departing chief economist.
Having worked closely with ECB President Mario Draghi through the years after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent euro crisis, Praet, more than anyone else, has been the one to steer the bank’s governing council toward a common decision in difficult situations.
His departure comes after that of Vice President Vítor Constâncio last summer, and he will be followed out by Draghi in October and Benoit Coeuré of the ECB executive board in December.
These important changes in the ECB leadership offer a chance to reflect on the challenges the Bank will face in the coming years.
As the eurozone’s only truly federal institution, the ECB has found itself acting as the “institution of last resort” during past crises, picking up the pieces when national governments fail to reach agreement.
It has managed this despite its complex governance structure.
The ECB governing council comprises 19 national central-bank governors, each representing countries with different interests, as well as the executive board, whose six members are appointed by the European Council following an intense bargaining process.
Though Draghi tends to get most of the attention, he made sure to point out at the colloquium that it was Praet whose recommendations have consistently been accepted by the governing council these past eight years.
The departing leadership’s success in building a consensus within such a diverse group should not be taken for granted.
Over the past decade, the ECB, like other central banks, has vastly expanded its monetary-policy toolkit.
This process started with Draghi’s predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, but it deepened under the current leadership with the launch of long-term refinancing operations for banks, quantitative easing (QE), forward guidance, and negative interest rates on deposits.
It was much more difficult for the ECB to these pursue unconventional measures than it was for the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan.
These policies have distributional implications well beyond those of traditional interest-rate policies, and in the eurozone this often takes on a geographical dimension, which can intensify disagreement.
Nonetheless, the ECB has capably defended the principle that these implications less important than the necessity (and economic advantage for all) of preserving the euro and fighting deflation.
Now, a new leadership team will have to face new challenges.
Appointees to the ECB must be technically competent, well regarded in the economic community, and politically unencumbered, so that they can resist pressure from national governments.
Their job is to devise a policy strategy that makes sense for the eurozone as a whole, while at the same time engaging with all stakeholders in a constructive manner.
These are demanding requirements.
If the ECB’s next leaders do not meet them, the euro itself will be at risk.
Complicating matters further, by 2020, the European Commission and the European Council will each have a new president and leadership teams of their own, and the European Parliament will have seated a new generation of politicians who have not taken part in the past decade’s compromises and reforms.
On the contrary, many of them will have been elected in a political environment of anger, diminished trust, and intra-EU fragmentation.
Still, there is a broad consensus that the eurozone will need more than monetary policy to ensure continued growth and stability.
Obviously, with interest rates at the zero lower bound, more monetary/fiscal-policy coordination is a must.
The eurozone would also benefit substantially from macroprudential policies and better bank-resolution tools, as well as the development of a common capital market.
Yet there is little political consensus for the expanded federal competencies and increased level of risk sharing such policies would require.
As a result, holding the eurozone together will continue to fall to the ECB.
The task will not be easy.
In the event of another slowdown, limited fiscal capacity in some countries, combined with the absence of common stabilization tools, suggests that the ECB will have to push the boundary of unconventional policies even further than it has.
That might mean expanding its asset-purchase program and the size and composition of its balance sheet.
Yet without progress toward deeper financial integration and a common capital market, private risk sharing will remain limited, impairing the effectiveness of the ECB’s efforts.
More broadly, the ECB should take stock of the past year and revise its strategy accordingly.
It needs to improve the transparency of its decision-making process by clarifying the roles of economic and monetary analysis in its “two-pillar approach” to maintaining price stability.
Its inflation target – currently defined as “below, but close to, 2% over the medium term” – must be made more precise, with a correction for its downward bias.
This process will be controversial.
As is already happening elsewhere, the ECB’s independence will be challenged.
But, unlike the Fed and the BOJ, the ECB will have to navigate the interests of separate countries across a deeply divided union.
Looking back, it is clear that a political agreement to create a common European currency would have been impossible but for the emergence of a worldwide consensus around central-bank independence in the 1990s.
That new consensus turned out to be so strong that the ECB’s independence was actually established by treaty (as the condition for Germany’s buy-in).
Independence is thus the eurozone’s key governing principle.
It must be defended at all costs, particularly in circumstances under which the ECB is forced to evolve and assume a larger role to make up for divisions among national governments.
The battle over central-bank independence will define the ECB’s next decade.
As national governments reflect on Praet’s departure and look ahead to the selection of a new president and executive board, one hopes they will take seriously the task of picking the right women and men for the job.

Can Turkey Rewrite the Crisis-Management Rules?
LAGUNA BEACH – Whether by accident or design, Turkey is trying to rewrite the chapter on crisis management in the emerging-market playbook.
Rather than opting for interest-rate hikes and an external funding anchor to support domestic policy adjustments, the government has adopted a mix of less direct and more partial measures – and this at a time when Turkey is in the midst of an escalating tariff tit-for-tat with the United States, as well as operating in a more fluid global economy.
How all this plays out is important not only for Turkey, but also for other emerging economies that already have had to cope with waves of financial contagion.
The initial phases of Turkey’s crisis were a replay of past emerging-market currency crises.
A mix of domestic and external events – an over-stretched credit-led growth strategy; concerns about the central bank’s policy autonomy and effectiveness; and a less hospitable global liquidity environment, owing in part to rising US interest rates – destabilized the foreign-exchange market.
A political spat with the US accelerated the run on the Turkish lira by fueling a self-reinforcing dynamic.
And all of this occurred in the context of a more uncertain and – aside from the US – weakening global economy.
In keeping with the traditional emerging-market-crisis script, Turkey’s currency crisis spilled over onto other emerging economies.
As is typically the case, the first wave of contagion was technical in nature, driven mainly by generalized outflows from Turkey’s currency and bond markets.
The longer this contagion continues, the greater the concern that it will lead to more disruptive financial and economic outcomes.
As such, central banks in several emerging economies – as diverse as Argentina, Hong Kong, and Indonesia – felt compelled to take counter-measures.
What has followed is what makes this episode of emerging-market crisis different, at least so far.
Rather than sticking with the approach taken by numerous other countries – including Argentina earlier this year – by raising interest rates and seeking some form of support from the International Monetary Fund, Turkey has shunned both in a very public manner, including through strident remarks by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Facing an accelerated exchange-rate depreciation that, at one stage, almost halved the lira’s value, Turkey has taken a variety of measures that attempt to simulate – albeit partially – the traditional approach that emerging economies have tended to follow in the past.
Domestically, it tightened funding conditions and, at the same time, provided liquidity to domestic banks, along with regulatory forbearance.
It made it harder for foreigners to access lira liquidity, thereby squeezing speculators that had shorted the currency.
It promised to deal with credit and fiscal excesses while ruling out capital controls.
Externally, the government has mobilized at least $15 billion from Qatar to be used for direct investment in Turkey.
And, in the midst of all this, the government also found time to retaliate against the doubling of tariffs on Turkish metal exports by US President Donald Trump’s administration.
The question is whether this response will be enough to act as a circuit breaker, thus giving the Turkish economy and its financial system time to regain their footing.
This is particularly important because continued currency turmoil would tip the economy into recession, raise inflation, stress the banking system, and increase corporate bankruptcies.
With this comes the toughest question of all for the government: Can it bring about recovery without reneging on its pledge not to raise interest rates or approach the IMF?
It is possible, but not probable.
Absent additional measures, it is unlikely that a critical mass of corrective steps has been attained in Turkey.
While the domestic policy adjustments provide short-term relief for the currency, they may be neither comprehensive nor sufficient as yet to return Turkey to a promising path for inclusive economic growth and durable financial stability.
On the external side, the funding from Qatar, assuming it materializes fully and in a timely fashion, appears small relative to Turkey’s gross external funding needs.
It also doesn’t come with the IMF imprimatur that reassures many investors.
And it is far from clear how this money will make its way into the economy to maximize the potential for currency stabilization.
And then there is the trade skirmish with the US.
Like other countries, it is only a matter of time until Turkey comes to the same realization as others about confronting the more protectionist stance adopted by the US.
Because of its size and systemic influence, and assuming it remains willing to incur the risk of suffering some damage in the process, the US is destined to win a tit-for-tat tariff escalation.
As such, the best approach is what the European Union decided to do last month: seek a way to pause the skirmish while working on the longer-term underlying issues.
Rather than rewriting the game plan for crisis management in emerging markets, Turkey may well end up confirming it.
One hopes this will lead to the restoration of financial stability and growth as the government looks to reverse its stance on central-bank independence, interest-rate policy, and perhaps even the IMF.
The alternative – persisting with the current approach and, in the process, running the risk of turning technical dislocations into much more damaging longer-term economic and financial disruptions – would also prove problematic for other emerging economies.

The Trouble with Hope
PARIS – America’s presidential election campaign is being followed in Europe with passionate interest.
It is seen as a long saga full of surprises.
The human and intellectual qualities of the three remaining candidates are even viewed with some envy on this side of the Atlantic, where you can hear statements such as: “Could we borrow just one of your candidates?” Many Europeans feel all three candidates are superb, and that, contrast to previous elections, America is suffering from an embarrassment of riches.
But Europeans’ interest in this presidential election cannot mask the fact that what they expect from it is far from clear.
Europeans may want a more “normal” America, closer to their own values, but they simultaneously worry that a more modest America would demand more of them in the realm of “hard” military power.
America as a model or America as a protector – this “European dilemma” is in itself new.
For, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, most Europeans viewed the United States as both its defender against the Soviet Union’s expansionist aims and the key external actor for their deeply wounded continent’s moral and economic reconstruction.
This is no longer the case.
The collapse of the USSR, America’s self-inflicted wounds – particularly in Iraq – and the spectacular rise of Asia have changed European perceptions of the US.
America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be, nor is it alone in terms of influence and power.
One can even say that the European Union has slowly become a “normative” force in the world in reaction to the evolution of America’s power.
Europe has long known that it could never balance America in the realm of “hard power”; but, with the decline of America’s “soft power,” it became more important than ever to incarnate the “humane” and law-abiding face of the West.
In this sense, Europe has come to see itself, at least in part, as an alternative dream for everyone who had stopped dreaming about America.
But, seen from within, the EU model often appears less convincing.
Thus, many Europeans continue to be nostalgic for America as a model.
For these Europeans, Barack Obama, campaigning under the banner of “hope,” is the ideal choice to restore, as if by magic, America’s soft power.
After all, he himself incarnates the American Dream.
But some Europeans prefer Hillary Clinton or even John McCain, because they are apprehensive about the consequences for America’s European partners of a more restrained and less experienced president.
They worry about not only competence, but also the old transatlantic issue of “burden sharing.”
The implicit question behind some European reservations about Obama may be formulated in one question: “Will we have to do more in Afghanistan and beyond?”
Could the restoration of America’s international reputation turn out to be bad for Europe, by eroding its new monopoly on representing Western values and calling it back to its hard power duties?
Could it be that a candidate of fear – McCain or, increasingly, Clinton – really serves Europe’s interests better than a candidate of hope?
With Obama in power, it would become – at least initially – more difficult for Europeans to denounce America, even if the “New France” of Nicolas Sarkozy has already moved away from this easy temptation.
But it would also be less easy to reject a call for greater burden sharing in the world.
This “defensive” view of transatlantic relations is problematic.
The best America for Europe and the world is a confident America – an America that sheds its culture of fear and rediscovers the roots of its culture of hope.
This is Obama’s America.
Of course, the greater your expectations are, the greater the risk of disappointment.
But, after eight years of America’s self-imposed isolation under Bush, it is a risk worth taking.
Even if America is no longer the world’s only superpower, it still remains the “indispensable nation.”
So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America’s presidential election.
Regardless of who wins, the consequences of the outcome will reverberate throughout the world.

Hollywood’s Favorite Villains
Once upon a time, Cold War enemies, white supremacists, and evil geniuses reigned supreme as Hollywood’s favorite bad guys.
No more.
Today, it is multinational corporations that are increasingly being cast as the über-villains of our globalized world.
For all their subliminal paid promotions and subtle product placements, corporations are getting drubbed in the main story lines of our popular culture.
This treatment goes far beyond documentaries like Michael Moore’s polemical Fahrenheit 9/11 or The Corporation , an earnest if somewhat paranoid portrayal of multinational companies’ role in globalization.
It extends to mainstream hits like The Constant Gardener , in which the idealistic protagonists do battle with a malicious global pharmaceutical company that is bent on exploiting Africa’s misery to test experimental drugs.
To be sure, sociopathic corporations have populated books and films for more than a century. But corporate villains, typically multinational companies, have never been so ubiquitous as today.
Is it unfair?
Most corporations, after all, are merely convenient mechanisms for ensuring that scarce global capital is used at maximum efficiency, to the benefit of all.
Are famously liberal Hollywood film directors spending too much time going to anti-globalization rallies?
Perhaps.
But I would submit that Hollywood’s misgivings, however untutored, represent only the tip of a growing iceberg of resentment against the perceived injustices of globalization.
The simple truth is that corporations represent capital, and capital – in the form of factories, equipment, machines, money, and even houses – has been the single biggest winner in the modern era of globalization.
Corporate profits are bursting at the seams of investors’ expectations in virtually every corner of the world.
Even in moribund economies like Germany and Italy, where employment security is vanishing, corporations are swimming in cash.
This phenomenon comes as no surprise to economists.
Add two billion Indian and Chinese workers to the global labor force, and the value of other means of production – particularly capital and commodities (for example, gold and oil) – is bound to go up. And so it has, with capitalists everywhere gaining an ever larger share of the economic pie.
(In theory, capitalists in labor-abundant China and India could end up as losers, but in practice they, too, have benefited thanks to their governments’ success in simultaneously liberalizing and globalizing.)
Many policymakers seem to be under the impression that surging profits are a purely cyclical phenomenon, as economies continue to grow out from the depths of the 2001 recession.
Wait a bit, they predict, and wages will fully catch up later in the cycle.
Not likely.
Capital’s piece of the pie has been getting bigger for more than 20 years, and the trend looks set to continue.
Indeed, corporations’ growing share of income has been a major driver behind the long, if uneven, bull market in stocks that began in the early 1990’s.
At the same time, inflation-adjusted wages for rich-country unskilled workers have barely budged over the last two decades.
Some of these trends also have to do with the nature of modern technological change, which seems to favor capital and skilled workers disproportionately.
But, regardless of their cause, rapidly growing inequalities are a powerful force for instability everywhere, from wealthy America to rapidly growing China to reform-challenged Europe. “A rising tide lifts all boats,” conservatives like to say.
Fine, but what happens to people, like the poor of hurricane-struck New Orleans, who don’t own boats?
Growing inequality would not be such a problem if governments could simply raise taxes on the rich and strengthen subsidies to the poor.
Unfortunately, any country that taxes capital too aggressively will only succeed in chasing it to regions where the tax burden is lighter.
In a globalized world, national governments’ ability to tax potentially mobile factors of production is sharply circumscribed.
The same mechanism that pours profits into the pockets of global corporations also prevents governments from claiming a larger share of the spoils.
Unfortunately, the long-term trend towards ever-lower income shares for unskilled workers is likely to continue over the coming decades, as modern technology permeates the globe, and as emerging markets like China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe continue to integrate into global production.
This is not to say that unskilled workers are actually being made worse off by globalization in absolute terms; the vast majority are actually breaking even or better.
But unskilled workers’ incomes are not keeping pace with overall economic growth, and the resulting social strains are a ticking bomb.
If so, then Hollywood’s cartoon-like caricatures of evil multinational corporations may some day seize mainstream consciousness, leading to political upheavals that shatter today’s social contract.
That won’t be good for profits, or for the poor.
Governments – and corporations – must find better ways to provide equal opportunity through improved education, broader financial markets, and other channels.
Otherwise, globalization’s storyline may not proceed according to the script.

Sustainability Equals Prosperity
Trinidad – Sustainability has become the foundation for almost all economic thinking nowadays.
It is essential not only to economic recovery today, but to ensuring peace and security tomorrow.
Factoring sustainability into all our thinking is necessary because, as a global society, we are living on the edge.
The last two years have brought a series of crises: energy, food, climate change, and global recession.
I fear that worse may be in store.
Indeed, today’s global economic crisis, if not handled properly, could evolve into a full-scale political crisis – one defined by social unrest, weakened governments, and angry publics who have lost faith in their leaders and their future.
In addition, we are entering a new age of austerity.
We are facing more problems with fewer resources.
National budgets have shrunk.
Aid programs are being squeezed.
Voluntary contributions are drying up.
Yet there is a third reality, which provides cause for optimism: the challenges that we face are interrelated, so, if we are smart about it, if we spot and utilize the inter-connections among these problems, solutions to each problem can be solutions to all.
We can get more bang for our collective buck, peso, and real, and find effective, efficient, enduring paths to a more sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous future.
At the recent G-20 summit in London, world leaders explicitly recognized these linkages.
They agreed on a genuine global stimulus that advanced the interests of all countries, not just a few.
They stood against protectionism, and they recognized the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals as an engine for development, growth, and creation of quality jobs worldwide.
They took a major step toward a “Green New Deal” and vowed to reach agreement at the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen in December.
This last development is vital.
I have seen shrinking glaciers in Antarctica and the Andes.
I have seen the effects of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and the loss of biodiversity.
The very existence of some Caribbean countries, including portions of Trinidad and Tobago, could be threatened if sea levels rise.
But bold, visionary leadership will be needed to seal a successor deal to the Kyoto Protocol in Copenhagen later this year.
The agreement reached there must be ambitious, effective, and fair, offering rich countries a way to cut greenhouse-gas emissions while supporting poorer countries as they adapt to the adverse impact of climate change.
We need to protect vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples, and we need financial incentives to preserve forests and the livelihoods of those who depend on them.
By tackling climate change, we also deal with the economic crisis — green jobs for green growth.
All of us see the links between economic growth and political stability, democracy, and human rights.
For me, as UN Secretary-General, collective social and economic security is a basic principle of justice – global social justice.
But to achieve this goal, we must think about and work to advance the sustainability agenda for what it really is: a prosperity agenda.
Opportunities to do so will be coming up at the July G-8 meeting in Italy and the climate change summit at the UN in September.
For my part, I pledge to bring the UN together in coordinated, decisive, and innovative ways to realize this agenda.
We will create a new mechanism for coordinating additional financing for food security to help vulnerable nations weather the storm.
We will support a Global Jobs Pact – a recovery strategy to meet peoples’ basic need for decent work.
And we will launch a UN Global Vulnerability Alert, collecting real-time information on the social effects of the economic crisis worldwide.
Ultimately, solidarity and common cause must be our greatest strength.
For today we have before us an opportunity to re-invent how we as countries work together to deliver collective solutions to our collective problems.
Indeed, the times require a new multilateralism as the foundation of a new and sustainable prosperity for all.

Germany’s Divided Soul
MUNICH – This November, Germany will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
But the country is in a gloomy mood, and cheers will be few and far between – especially in the east.
Today, more than one-third of eastern Germans describe themselves as second-class citizens.
Contrary to their expectations at the time of German reunification in 1990, the east of the country has not become as prosperous as the west.
Unsurprisingly, eastern Germans today think, feel, and vote differently than western Germans do.
In fact, Germany is one country with two souls.
The latest evidence of this came on September 1, when the xenophobic right-wing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) secured a strong second place in regional elections in the eastern German states of Saxony and Brandenburg, with 27.5% and 23.5% of the vote, respectively.
In western German states, the AfD’s electoral share is typically half of that.
Germany’s east-west political divide reflects sharp economic differences.
Between 1991 and 1996, per capita income in eastern Germany increased from 42% to 67% of west German levels.
But in the 20 years after 1996, this figure rose only to 74%.
In other words, the post-1989 process of economic convergence between eastern and western Germany largely came to a halt around 25 years ago.
Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s 1990 prediction of “flourishing landscapes” in the east still has not materialized.
Economic convergence within Germany stalled largely as a result of policy decisions. Prior to reunification in October 1990, the West German government decided to liberalize trade with East Germany overnight.
All barriers to the movement of capital and labor were removed, and the East German Ostmark was converted into Deutsche Marks at a rate of 1:1 for smaller amounts, and 2:1 for larger sums.
The currency reform caused eastern German wages to rise to western German levels, even though eastern productivity was only 10% of that in the west.
As a result, East Germany’s manufacturing sector went bankrupt overnight, and its firms lost all their Eastern European markets.
In 1990, the East German government established a new super-authority, the Treuhandanstalt, to help the country’s manufacturers to survive.
The agency privatized and sold eastern German companies and assets to western firms, often at a symbolic price of one DM in exchange for job guarantees.
This massive subsidy gave western German firms an incentive to move to the east, even though the latter had lost its comparative low-wage advantage.
The program worked: by 1994, the Treuhandanstalt had sold virtually all eastern German firms to western investors, and the agency was dismantled.
For a while, the eastern German economy grew rapidly and started to catch up with western Germany.
But without the Treuhandanstalt to provide further subsidies, western firms did not want to invest in eastern Germany.
And as investment dried up, the east’s convergence process came to a standstill.
Eastern Germans, meanwhile, hated the Treuhandanstalt, and saw it as the body giving away valuable assets to western firms.
The agency’s first chairman, Detlev Rohwedder, was assassinated in 1991; even today, two populist German parties – the left-wing Die Linke and the right-wing AfD – blame the organization for eastern Germany’s economic plight.
After 1989, eastern Germans were told that there was no alternative to the Treuhandanstalt, because they had no high-quality products to sell.
But the law of comparative advantage holds that a country always has something to sell if its wages and prices are low enough.
Unfortunately, the high wages and prices resulting from the 1990 currency reform prevented the eastern German economy from thriving like other Eastern European countries did following the collapse of communism.
The narrative of having “nothing to sell” and a “low-value manufacturing sector” had a detrimental effect on the eastern German psyche.
People felt they had no value in a market economy and lost their dignity.
In the 1990s, I worked at the Humboldt University of Berlin in the east of the city, and experienced firsthand this feeling of worthlessness among eastern Germans.
The German government’s biggest mistake, however, was to dismantle the Treuhandanstalt after all the eastern assets were sold.
Instead, the agency should have continued to offer subsidies to foreign firms willing to invest in eastern Germany, in order to compensate for the high wages there.
But it is never too late for Germany to restart the economic convergence process.
Encouragingly, the government is now discussing how to create equivalent living conditions (gleichwertige Lebensverhältnisse) in the east and west of the country.
By introducing economic incentives for foreign investment in eastern Germany, policymakers could yet help to bring about the flourishing landscapes that Kohl envisaged.
An economic recovery in the east would not only bring material benefits.
It would also help to heal Germany’s psychological divide, and thus make eastern Germans less likely to vote for extremist parties that prey on their fears.

Tackling Climate Change with COVID-19 Urgency
DUBLIN/CAPE TOWN – In recent weeks, the world has been focused on urgently battling the fast-evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
The World Health Organization, governments, and central banks have acted rapidly to mitigate the virus’s impact, while scientists, policymakers, and public-health experts are sharing vital data via sophisticated tracking tools.
And the large number of people who have recovered from the virus attests to the efficacy of the response to date.
But in addition to the novel and immediate COVID-19 threat, the world also faces an unprecedented climate and environmental emergency.
Governments and businesses must now start addressing climate change with the same resolve and urgency that they are showing in fighting the pandemic.
Consider air pollution, which kills an estimated seven million people worldwide each year.
Unlike COVID-19, this threat is not new, stems from multiple sources, and is closely linked to how we heat and light our homes, move around, and deal with waste – daily habits that are deeply embedded in our lifestyles and economic systems.
Tackling such a complex challenge thus requires action on many fronts to reduce the risk of even more premature deaths.
Indeed, while the COVID-19 response has demonstrated the power of open, collaborative science and swift action in dealing with emerging threats, it also has highlighted deep-seated issues that limit our ability to respond to challenges like global environmental change.
In particular, the world is waking up to the possibility that the pandemic – and the strict measures introduced to contain it – could result in an even deeper economic downturn than the one triggered by the 2008 global financial crisis.
The systemic nature of such risks may also explain why climate action to date has been insufficient.
The science is clear: Global carbon dioxide emissions must decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by mid-century if the world is to have a chance of preventing catastrophic global warming.
But although the need for urgent and decisive government action in this area has never been greater, political leaders have so far failed to rise to the challenge.
In fact, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres’s warning at last December’s COP25 climate conference that “we are knowingly destroying the very support systems keeping us alive” might be the most alarming words ever uttered by a UN leader.
As matters stand, countries’ nationally determined contributions under the 2015 Paris agreement would have to be five times more ambitious in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2050.
Likewise, although a growing number of companies are pledging to become carbon neutral, this share needs to increase significantly.
Too many multinational corporations and investors resist adopting climate-friendly policies and exert heavy pressure on governments, which in turn are unwilling to take the bold and potentially unpopular steps that are needed.
Yet, a relatively small number of fossil-fuel companies are responsible for a significant proportion of global CO2 emissions.
By putting a real price on carbon, governments can set in motion a controlled shift away from fossil-fuel dependence.
Digital platforms can play their part, too.
After all, Google and Facebook have removed false information about COVID-19, along with offers that try to profit from it.
They should also consider limiting the visibility of people who spread false information about climate change, or of companies that depend on climate-endangering activities.
This year marks a critical juncture for global climate action, and not only because it falls halfway between the 2010 baseline for CO2 emissions and the 2030 deadline for significant cuts.
It also is a bumper year for environmental negotiations, with new global biodiversity goals expected later this year (October’s meeting has now been postponed, owing to COVID-19), and COP26 now scheduled to take place in 2021.
With countries’ climate pledges up for review, COP26 will be a make-or-break moment that tells us whether we can avert a global climate disaster.
Any global climate action must start by considering our common humanity, and the need for solutions that are just and equitable for everyone.
Because the climate-change burden falls most heavily on the countries least responsible for causing it, those that are most responsible – the rich and developed countries – must lead the way in cutting emissions.
In many respects, the last 12 months have been encouraging, with creative responses to climate change and indications of behavioral shifts such as new no-fly trends.
Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren around the world have protested against climate inaction, spurred on by the indomitable Greta Thunberg, while grassroots climate mobilization has reached unprecedented levels.
But climate policies that disadvantage certain groups can lead to a backlash, such as the “Yellow Vest” protests that exploded in France in response to a planned fuel-tax increase.
Such unrest highlights the need to put social justice at the heart of our climate response.
In 2020, the world is at a social tipping point.
Scientists and civil society must jointly raise their voices and make every effort to ensure that we emerge on the right side of it.
Young people have urged political leaders to listen to the scientists.
And, as in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community stands ready to work side by side with governments and businesses to put humanity on a sustainable climate path while managing the development trade-offs responsibly.
The COVID-19 threat has shown that governments can act swiftly and resolutely in a crisis, and that people are ready to change their behavior for the good of humanity.
The world must now urgently adopt the same approach to the existential challenge of climate change.

Shale Gas to the Rescue?
LONDON – The developed world is slowly emerging from the Great Recession, but a question lingers: How fast and how far will the recovery go?
One big source of pessimism has been the idea that we are running out of investment opportunities – and have been since before the 2008 crash.
But is that true?
The last big surge of innovation was the Internet revolution, whose products came onstream in the 1990’s.
Following the dot-com collapse of the early 2000’s, speculation in real estate and financial assets – enabled by cheap money – kept Western economies going.
The post-2008 slump merely exposed the unsoundness of the preceding boom; the mediocrity of the recovery reflects the mediocrity of previous prospects, coolly considered.
The risk now is that a debt-fueled asset spike merely perpetuates the boom-bust cycle.
The economist Larry Summers has reintroduced the term “secular stagnation” to describe what awaits us.
By the mid-2000’s, Summers argued at a recent International Monetary Fund conference, the average prospective return on new investment in the United States had fallen below any feasible reduction in the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate.
That remains true today.
We may be in a permanent liquidity trap, in which nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, but the expected rate of return to investment remains negative.
Unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing may inflate a new generation of asset bubbles, but the underlying problem – negative returns to new investment – will not have been solved by the time the next crash comes.
So the problem is poor investment prospects.
Why?
In the 1930’s, the economist Alvin Hansen argued that opportunities for new investment in already-rich countries were drying up.
Investment growth had depended on population growth, technological innovation, and westward expansion.
With the closing of the frontier and static populations, growth would depend on innovation; but future innovation would require smaller inputs of capital and labor than in the past.
In other words, the returns to capital were bound to fall as it became more abundant relative to population.
In this situation, full employment could be maintained only by running continuous fiscal deficits.
John Maynard Keynes held a different view.
In 1945, he wrote to T.S. Eliot: “[T]he full employment policy by means of investment is only one particular application of an intellectual theorem. You can produce the result just as well by consuming more or working less.
Personally, I regard the investment policy as first aid.…Less work is the ultimate solution.”
Developed countries’ strong postwar investment performance dispelled fear of secular stagnation. But this occurred after a world war that had created huge pent-up demand for new equipment, transport infrastructure, and household appliances, together with a military-industrial complex that armed the West during the Cold War.
The real rate of return to capital may have started to decline by the early 1970’s; productivity growth certainly has slowed since then.
Some crucial changes in the political economy of Western capitalism in the 1980’s can also be viewed in this light: the rise of neoliberal ideology, the growing inequality of wealth and incomes, the increase in structural unemployment, the growth of financial services, globalization, the invention of post-Cold War threats to sustain military spending, and so on.
The question today is whether a new upsurge of investment will come to our rescue.
Optimists point to the shale-energy revolution in the US.
The McKinsey Global Institute has identified shale energy as a “game changer” for the world economy, estimatingthat it could boost America’s GDP by as much as 4% ($690 billion) per year and add 1.7 million permanent jobs to the labor market by 2020.
From 2007 to 2012, North American shale-gas production grew at an average annual rate of more than 50%.
As a result, the share of shale gas in America’s overall gas production rose from just 5% in 2007 to 36% in 2012.
With the share of imports in US natural-gas consumption dropping from 16.5% in 2007 to 11% in 2010, America is on the path to energy self-sufficiency.
Likewise, a September 2013 report by IHS concludes that midstream industries like transportation and downstream industries like manufacturing and chemicals are also receiving a massive stimulus.
As a result of the shale-energy boom, “over $216 billion in total will be invested in the midstream and downstream oil and gas industries” from 2012 to 2025.
Nearly 380,000 of the 2.1 million jobs that shale-related industries generated in the US in 2012 , were created in these areas.
Beyond this, the most dramatic impact of shale oil and gas on the economy has been the fall in energy prices.
In the US, the price of natural gas has fallen to $4 per MMBtu, from $13 in 2008, boosting household purchasing power. IHS estimates that in 2012, developments in the shale-energy industry increased households’ real disposable income by more than $1,200.
Thus the shale revolution represents a huge stimulus for America, in terms of investment, exports, and a reduction in energy costs.
I am not in a position either to judge the quantitative impact of shale energy on the US economy and, via growth there, on the rest of the world, or to comment on its geopolitical consequences or net effect on carbon emissions.
But it does seem to me that contemporary apostles of secular stagnation like Summers and Paul Krugman at least ought to be taking the shale-energy revolution into account.

The Power of Mini-Grids
HARARE – Despite impressive economic development in recent years, Africa still lags far behind on energy, with almost two-thirds of the continent’s citizens lacking access to electricity.
While getting more power to the people is an important goal, extending electricity grids is expensive and slow.
Meanwhile, off-grid options may not be sufficient to meet people’s energy needs.
Fortunately, there is a third approach that can help fill in the gaps: mini-grids.
Mini-grids are essentially localized electricity networks that supply several users, whether households or businesses.
They can be grid-connected, but they do not have to be.
And, as a new report from the Africa Progress Panel (of which one of the authors is a member) shows – and as another report by the Rocky Mountain Institute underscores – mini-grids are an important piece of Africa’s energy puzzle.
Mini-grids can have a major competitive advantage over grid extension in rural and remote areas, because they can provide electricity more quickly and at much lower cost.
Because mini-grids require less capital investment than grid expansion, it can be easier to secure financing for them, meaning that they can electrify communities that might have to wait years for a grid connection.
Mini-grids also have a distinct advantage over off-grid systems: greater power generation.
Productivity-enhancing farm machinery, for example, usually requires more power than off-grid household systems can provide.
Moreover, mini-grids can be used to increase the resilience of existing electricity systems.
Power cuts on the main grid can affect a large number of businesses and households, and it can be difficult to restore services quickly.
Mini-grids can ensure that consumers retain access to power when the grid suffers interruptions.
Despite these benefits, the potential of mini-grids to help address Africa’s energy challenge has yet to be tapped.
Reliance on mini-grids is expanding more slowly than in other world regions, with Africa being more likely to implement off-grid systems.
One obstacle is the lack of proven commercial business models and adequate and appropriate forms of financing.
Another is that policy frameworks often are not accommodating.
And many developers and operators lack the requisite knowledge and experience.
The situation is ripe for change.
With the United Nations sustainable development agenda ambitiously targeting universal access to energy by 2030, policymakers are paying more attention to electrification, and development-finance institutions and partners are making more funding available.
Meanwhile, the cost of renewable energy is falling; energy efficiency is improving, both for generating equipment and for the machines to be powered; and innovative digital technologies are facilitating the management of electricity services.
A flexible solution like mini-grids is well suited to this context.
As it stands, mini-grids in Africa are mostly diesel or hydropower systems.
Yet mini-grids can – and increasingly do –take the form of solar PV and hybrid systems, with hybrid systems being particularly promising.
Diesel systems face the risk of fuel-supply disruptions or cost increases, while renewable-energy generation can vary according to weather and season.
Hybrid systems that combine diesel with solar or wind power mitigate these risks.
Mini-grids are flexible in other ways, too. Mini-grids may or may not be connected to the national grid.
They can be operated privately, by utilities, on a community basis, or according to a public-private model.
And they can sell electricity to retail consumers, utilities, or both.
So how can African governments use the potential of mini-grids to help expand energy access?
As recent experience in the United States has shown, early adoption of technical innovations, particularly of digital management tools, could enable mini-grid business models to become more cost-efficient.
New technologies could even enable mini-grid providers to develop entirely new organizational models for electricity systems that are more effective and resilient than the conventional utility-based approach.
Experience in the US, as well as in Asia, also underscores the importance of favorable government policy and regulations, including capital subsidies.
The challenge, of course, will be for each African government to design a mini-grid strategy around the options and models that work locally.
That means setting appropriate tariffs and establishing a coherent framework of technical, financial, and procedural regulations.
It also requires building up the necessary skills and capacities in the labor force.
In developing their electricity systems, most African countries will have to consider and combine many different models and options.
For many, mini-grids can play an important role.
If African governments embrace diversity in the way electricity is generated and distributed, they could provide modern energy to millions of people, while placing the continent at the forefront of a global energy transformation.

Connectivity and the Modern Refugee
GENEVA – They were fresh off the boat, the group of refugees I met this time last year.
They had fled their homes in Syria, traveled halfway across Turkey, and placed their lives in the hands of a gang of people smugglers promising to get them to Europe.
Despite all that they had endured, one of them told me, upon landing on the Greek island of Lesbos, that they had panicked only once during that perilous voyage: when their mobile phone signal disappeared.
That signal, however weak, had been the refugees’ only link to the outside world.
When it vanished – when they truly had no way to contact family, friends, or anyone who could help them – they were gripped by a sense of isolation and fear more intense than they had ever experienced.
It is a feeling no one should have to endure ever again.
For most people in the industrialized world – and everyone at this year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos – connectivity is a fact of life.
We have mobile phones, tablets, and computers, all linked to superfast – and accelerating – broadband networks.
Add to that an ever-increasing number of social-media platforms, and we are always in contact with one another.
Information flows so freely and relentlessly, in fact, that we tend to worry more about overload than scarcity.
For refugees, life is very different.
Globally, refugees are 50% less likely than the general population to have an Internet-enabled phone, and 29% of refugee households have no phone at all.
Though 90% of refugees located in urban environments live in places with 2G or 3G coverage, about a fifth of those living in rural areas have no connectivity at all.
This is a big deal.
For refugees, connectivity is not a luxury, but a lifeline – one that has become all the more important at a time when sentiment in many host countries is turning against them (even as plenty of grassroots movements and communities remain eager to help).
In some cases, technology can do what hostile politicians and reluctant governments will not: give refugees a chance to rebuild their lives.
Connectivity means, at the most fundamental level, being able to remain in contact with family members left behind, some of whom may still be at risk of violence or persecution.
Connectivity also provides access to important and up-to-date information about new threats, such as disease outbreaks or the spread of conflict, or the availability of necessities like food and water, clothing, shelter, and health care.
In the longer term, connectivity can support online education and training that equips refugees for the workforce.
It can help them find employment, and link them with legal or other crucial services.
And it can enable them to communicate more easily with organizations like the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), telling us what they need most, what we’re getting right, and where we need to make changes.
In a world of unlimited data, there is little stopping us from providing refugees with this lifesaving connectivity.
If we are smart about how we design digital aid systems, we will have the opportunity to broaden our partnerships to hundreds, if not thousands, of organizations worldwide that are willing to help refugees.
Realizing this potential requires overcoming two key challenges.
First, we must figure out how to improve connectivity for refugees today.
Second, we must position ourselves to use technology more effectively tomorrow.
Overcoming these challenges will require, first and foremost, that governments improve access, including by investing in the necessary digital infrastructure.
It will also require contributions from the private sector, particularly telecommunications providers, which can lend their technological expertise, global reach, and spending power to help ensure access to affordable phones and computers, inexpensive data plans, and training in digital literacy.
Success on these fronts will require using microwave links, satellite dishes, unused television spectrum, drones, and balloons to improve wireless Internet access and capabilities in locations containing many refugees.
Because the vast majority of today’s refugees are in developing countries, improved connectivity would carry far-reaching benefits for the host communities.
In 2014, my colleagues encountered a young Syrian man called Hany, who had fled the city of Homs with his family and found refuge in a camp in Lebanon’s Beka’a Valley.
A poet, rapper, and photographer, Hany was such a force of nature that it took my colleagues a while to realize he had a serious eye condition and could see only a few inches in front of his face.
His mobile phone was utterly essential.
It enabled him to learn English, take his first photographs, and call for help when he needed it.
That same phone rang one day with the news that the city of Regina, Canada, was to be his new home.
As he put it, “my phone is my little world.”
For refugees like Hany, staying connected is not only a matter of survival; it also provides a route to self-reliance and independence, boosting their own wellbeing and enabling them to contribute to the communities that host them.
Last year, the World Economic Forum launched a program called Internet For All.
We must ensure that “All” includes refugees.

A Faster Route to Greener Shipping
LONDON – Delegates from over 190 countries recently gathered in Lisbon for the United Nations Ocean Conference, the most important event on this issue this year.
Opening the meeting, UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged governments “to raise their level of ambition for the recovery of ocean health.”
Governments must heed that entreaty.
Climate change has become a constant factor in the ocean’s decline. Rising sea levels, coral reef degradation, and more severe coastal weather events suggest a bleak future for an ecosystem that spans almost three-quarters of our planet.
But if one thing was obvious in Lisbon, it is that a growing number of governments – from Fiji to the United States – are starting to crack down on a sector that relies exclusively on the dirtiest and most polluting fossil fuels: the international shipping industry.
The Marshall Islands, the US, Kenya, and Denmark called for immediate action to achieve zero-emission shipping by 2050, while the UN secretary-general pressed the sector to “present credible plans” to achieve this goal.
Shipping is the most efficient mode of transport for most goods, moving around 80% of all traded products every year.
It is here to stay.
But global shipping emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to the emissions of 243 coal-fired power plants.
Recent projections show that the problem could get even worse, with shipping emissions reaching 90-130% of 2008 levels by 2050 if we fail to act.
The International Maritime Organization, the specialized UN agency that regulates maritime transport, must play a key role in reducing shipping-related emissions and improving the industry’s energy efficiency.
The IMO is currently revising its 2018 climate strategy, which aims to reduce shipping emissions by at least 50% by mid-century.
Encouragingly, a growing number of IMO member states favor aligning the sector with the 2050 zero-emissions target set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
The US, the United Kingdom, and 12 other countries raised this issue at last year’s UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, bringing more global attention to shipping than ever before – at least as far as UN climate summits go.
But setting a distant decarbonization deadline is not enough, given climate scientists’ repeated warnings that global warming is on course to reach 1.5° Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels, by 2037 – not 2050.
The IMO must listen to the scientists and seek to secure an agreement among member states during the current negotiations to eliminate shipping emissions well before mid-century.
In addition, countries need to set gradually increasing emissions-reduction targets for key economic sectors, with modest goals for as early as 2025 followed by more ambitious objectives for 2030 and 2040.
For example, researchers have suggested cutting shipping emissions by at least 34% by 2030 in order to reach zero by 2050.
A concrete, step-by-step decarbonization pathway at the global level will nudge countries to move the industry progressively away from hydrocarbons and toward clean and sustainable fuels.
The European Union is already embarking on this path by proposing to include shipping emissions in its carbon market and by setting sustainability targets for marine fuels.
A truly ambitious IMO climate strategy could drive a wave of green innovation in the shipping industry. Firms would have to invest their multibillion-dollar profits in the development and uptake of clean fuels such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, and battery technologies, and in replacing their fossil-fuel-powered fleets with zero-emission vessels.
Along the way, they should improve their fleets’ energy and operational efficiency, which is one of the fastest ways to cut shipping’s climate pollution.
For many people around the world, whether the world sets clear targets for clean shipping and manages to limit global warming to 1.5°C, rather than 2°C or higher, is an existential issue.
Small island states already on the front line of the climate crisis are most at risk of a global temperature rise above these levels, as a recent report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted.
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C can reduce sea-level rise this century by ten centimeters – meaning ten million fewer people will be at risk of coastal flooding.
The UN Ocean Conference declaration stated that the IMO must urgently align its climate ambition with the Paris agreement’s global-warming targets and set “clear interim goals” to start reducing the shipping industry’s greenhouse-gas emissions “as soon as possible.”
This is a welcome if long-overdue step.
Governments and shipping firms, working with the IMO, must now translate this ambition into firm targets and concrete measures.

A Russian Spring?
PARIS – Russia is not Egypt.
And Moscow is not on the eve of revolution as Cairo was less than a year ago.
Indeed, Russia’s powerful have at their disposal assets that former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s regime lacked.
As an energy superpower, Russia can open its coffers to appease, at least in part, the humiliation that it has inflicted on its citizens by falsifying the country’s recent legislative election results.
And not all Russians are in the streets.
We should beware of the “zoom effect,” which made many people believe that the young protesters of Cairo’s Tahrir Square were fully representative of Egyptian society.
They were not.
Rural Egypt, like rural Russia, is much more conservative than the young elites who seize the world’s imagination with their protests and embrace of modern social media.
Furthermore, Mubarak was old and sick, and no longer enjoyed the trust of his people.
Vladimir Putin, by contrast, exudes energy and health, and may still reassure many segments of Russian society whose main concern is their country’s glory rather than its citizens’ happiness.
Yet Putin may be overplaying the macho card so excessively that it could backfire and contribute to his isolation from Russia’s urban and more educated voters.
But, even if the tens of thousands of demonstrators are unlikely to threaten the survival of Putin’s regime, the Kremlin would be wise to take them seriously.
The protesters’ trademark so far has been moderation and restraint; nothing would be more dangerous than violent repression.
Beyond the issue of violence, the Russian authorities would take a huge historical risk by failing to register the public’s growing alienation.
Sheltered physically and metaphorically by the Kremlin’s high walls, and having progressively lost contact with the living conditions of ordinary people (if they ever had any), Russia’s leaders seem to consider their lifestyle to be both normal and eternal.
From the standpoint of condemning elite behavior, Russian protesters evoke, at least partly, the actors of the Arab revolution.
In their denunciation of “Soviet electoral practices,” they reject the combination of despotism and corruption that characterized Soviet power yesterday and Russian power today – rhetoric familiar from Arab revolutionaries.
As young Arabs told the rulers of Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Yemen, and other Arab countries, this new generation of Russians is telling Putin: “Get Out!”
But most participants hold few illusions about the efficacy of their protest. They want to express to Russia’s rulers the extent of their frustration and determination.
They may not expect regime change, but they expect at least some minimal reforms.
Above all, they want to set limits on Putin’s power.
But their protest’s ironic consequence may be that the more moderate of the two figures at the summit of Russian politics, Dmitri Medvedev, will not return to the post of prime minister, as had been planned.
A game of political musical chairs would simply be too much in the eyes of too many Russians.
The protests have caught the Kremlin’s masters, as well as the majority of Russia’s citizens, by surprise.
They failed to recognize that globalization – particularly the global information revolution – has made the world more transparent and interdependent than ever.
The protesters of Madrid were inspired by those of Cairo, and were themselves a source of inspiration from New York to Tel Aviv – and, subsequently, to Moscow.
A lesson emerges: with the deepening of the economic crisis, on the one hand, and instant global connectivity, on the other, what was accepted yesterday is regarded as intolerable today.
That applies to Russia, too.
For a long time, Russia has perceived itself as a “White Africa.”
The average life expectancy of Russian men, slightly below 60, is more African than European (or even Asian, for the most part).
The corrupt enrichment of so many Russian elites mimics the disastrous habits of many of their African counterparts.
But this comparison has limits.
Despite its many problems, Africa today has become a continent of hope.
Its population is exploding, as are its economic-growth rates.
Senegalese firms seek to help their Spanish business partners, while Portugal extends an almost royal welcome to the leaders of their former colony, newly oil-rich Angola.
Africa is on the rise, while Russia is on the decline.
The democratic idealism that accompanied the fall of communism 20 years ago is gone, but the “imperial pride” recovered in part during the Putin years may not be enough to compensate for the contempt with which the Russian state treats its citizens.
Russia’s demonstrators’ message is simple: “Too much corruption, disdain, and inequality is too much.” Russia, like the Arab world, wants modernity.

The Grand Global Health Convergence
SAN FRANCISCO – The world is at a unique historical inflection point.
By making today’s medicines, vaccines, and other health tools universally available – and by stepping up research efforts to develop tomorrow’s health tools – we could close the health gap between wealthy and poor countries within a generation.
By 2035, we could achieve a “grand convergence” in global health, reducing preventable maternal and child deaths, including those caused by infectious diseases, to unprecedentedly low levels worldwide.
What it will take is a coordinated, future-oriented investment strategy.
A group of 25 global health and economics experts (including us) recently came together to develop such a strategy.
In a year-long process, the group identified the tools, systems, and financing that would be needed to achieve global health convergence, and produced Global Health 2035 – an ambitious investment blueprint that would save millions of lives and bolster human welfare, productivity, and economic growth.
With aggressively scaled-up health investments, ten million lives could be saved annually, beginning in 2035.
And the economic payoff would be enormous: every dollar invested in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to achieve this grand convergence would return $9-20.
Success will require a global commitment to ensuring that everyone can access today’s powerful health technologies and services, like childhood vaccines, treatment for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and prenatal care for pregnant women.
It will also require increased funding for the development and delivery of new health tools to redress the conditions that disproportionately kill women and children in LMICs.
To this end, one of the central features of the convergence strategy is family planning.
As it stands, more than 220 million women worldwide lack access to modern contraception – an inexcusable situation, given that scaling up family planning would be remarkably simple and inexpensive.
And the benefits would be vast.
For starters, improved access to contraception would prevent an estimated one-third of all maternal deaths, and would have a particularly large impact among those facing the highest risk.
These include 15-19-year-old women in poor countries, who currently have the least access to contraception, and women who have multiple pregnancies in quick succession, by allowing them to space out their pregnancies.
By reducing the rate of unwanted pregnancies, family planning also decreases the number of deaths from unsafe abortions.
This is not only good for mothers.
Reducing high-risk pregnancies, curbing unwanted pregnancies, and spacing out births have been shown to decrease newborn and child death rates.
The Guttmacher Institute estimates that fully meeting women’s need for contraception would prevent 600,000 newborn deaths and 500,000 child deaths annually.
Moreover, cutting birth rates, which are very high in many LMICs, would help to reduce the strain on these countries’ health-care systems by diminishing the costs of maternal and newborn care and immunization.
At the same time, it would facilitate social change that fuels increased productivity and output.
According to a study coordinated by the World Health Organization, the economic return from scaling up contraception in 27 countries with very high birth rates, such as Afghanistan and Chad, would exceed 8% of GDP from now until 2035.
So, how much would it cost to ensure universal access to modern medicine and health services?
Global Health 2035 puts the total at an additional $70 billion dollars annually, with $1 billion of this increase allocated to family planning alone.
But most of the costs can ultimately be covered by LMICs themselves.
In fact, the total bill for global health convergence amounts to less than 1% of the additional GDP that these countries are expected to generate in the next two decades.
In other words, public investment of less than 1% of GDP could avert a massive ten million deaths each year.
Innovative partnerships aimed at reducing costs can diminish this burden even more.
A group of donor governments, foundations, the United Nations, and private-sector actors recently came together to reduce the price of a long-lasting contraceptive implant (Levonorgestrel) from $18 to $8.50 per unit in more than 50 LMICs.
The international community must play a major role in achieving convergence.
Specifically, it must increase investment in research and development for the diseases that affect the poor, like childhood pneumonia and diarrhea, which kill around two million children every year.
And direct financial assistance to LMICs – for example, to fund family-planning programs and combat malaria and HIV/AIDS – will be required for years to come.
The opportunity to achieve a grand convergence in global health outcomes is within reach.
We need only to convince ourselves to grasp it.

The Hero of His Time
Boris Yeltsin was utterly unique.
Russia’s first democratically elected leader, he was also the first Russian leader to give up power voluntarily, and constitutionally, to a successor.
But he was also profoundly characteristic of Russian leaders.
Using various mixtures of charisma, statecraft, and terror, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Alexander II, Peter Stolypin (the last tsar’s prime minister), Lenin, and Stalin all sought to make Russia not only a great military power, but also an economic and cultural equal of the West.
Yeltsin aimed for the same goal.
But he stands out from them in this respect: he understood that empire was incompatible with democracy, and so was willing to abandon the Soviet Union in order to try to build a democratic order at home.
At the height of Yeltsin’s career, many Russians identified with his bluntness, impulsiveness, sensitivity to personal slight, even with his weakness for alcohol.
And yet in the final years of his rule, his reputation plunged.
Only in the last few months of his second presidential term, after he launched the second war in Chechnya in September 1999, did he and his lieutenants regain some legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian public, while causing revulsion among any remaining Western admirers.
Despite his caprices, however, Yeltsin kept Russia on a course of broad strategic co-operation with America and its allies.
Although he opposed America’s use of force against Iraq and Serbia in the 1990’s, his government never formally abandoned the sanctions regime against either country.
Moreover, no nuclear weapons were unleashed, deliberately or accidentally, and no full-scale war of the kind that ravaged post-communist Yugoslavia broke out between Russia and any of its neighbors, although several of them were locked in internal or regional conflict in which Russia’s hand was visible.
The tasks that faced Yeltsin when he attained power in 1991 were monumental.
At several crucial moments, he established himself as the only person who could rise to the challenges of transforming Russia from a dictatorship into a democracy, from a planned economy into a free market, and from an empire into a medium-ranked power.
In 1992, as the emerging Russian Federation teetered on the brink of economic and monetary collapse, he opted for radical reform, prompting a backlash from vested interest groups.
In the years that followed, he would tilt toward liberal economics whenever he felt powerful enough to do so.
Yeltsin was quintessentially a product of the Soviet system, which makes his turn to democracy and the free market, though imperfect, even more miraculous.
The son of a poor building worker, he had a meteoric rise through communist ranks to become party boss in the industrial city of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in the Urals.
Unlike most other party leaders, he was good at talking to ordinary people, a skill that helped him win support and then power later, but he also showed no sign of questioning the Marxist-Leninist gobbledygook that he was required to recite at public events.
It was only after Mikhail Gorbachev summoned Yeltsin to Moscow in 1985 that he began to differentiate himself from dozens of other senior party apparatchiks.
Sensing the bitter frustration of Moscow’s middle class-in-waiting, Yeltsin quickly gained a reputation as a harsh, if not always coherent, critic of the party’s old guard.
Campaigners for democracy admired Yeltsin’s struggle against the conservatives in the politburo – especially after he was forced out of the party’s inner circle in November 1987.
Determined to outbid Gorbachev as a reformer, he persuaded liberals to overcome their distrust of his provincial manners.
They gave him lessons in democratic theory, while he gave them tactical advice.
As the Soviet Union steadily disintegrated, with virtually all of its 15 republics straining at the leash, Yeltsin gained the leadership of the largest – the Russian Federation – which placed him in a tactical alliance with independence campaigners in Ukraine, the Baltic states, and Georgia.
By June 1991, after quashing a series of challenges to his leadership, he became the first elected president of Russia; two months later, real power fell into his hands, after the failed putsch against Gorbachev of August 1991 by conservatives seeking to prevent the Soviet Union’s disintegration.
For most Westerners and many Russians, his finest hour came on August 19th that year, when he stood on a tank outside the Russian parliament and defied the hardliners who had seized power.
But Yeltsin himself never succeeded in fully throwing off the intellectual shackles of the past.
As president, he talked of economic performance as if it could be improved by decree.
Like most Russians, he wanted the material advantages of capitalism, but had little respect or understanding for the rule of law and dispersion of power, which makes capitalist institutions work.
Nevertheless, for most of his presidency, Yeltsin kept alive – albeit with many tactical retreats – the goal of economic reform.
At some level, he sensed that Russia’s potential could be unleashed only if the government either faced down, or bought off, the special interests – military, industrial, and agricultural – that stood in the way.
The economic orthodoxy pursued after the collapse of 1998 laid the groundwork for today’s sustained Russian boom.
Yeltsin’s tragedy, and Russia’s, was that, when the country needed a leader with vision and determination, it found an agile political operator instead.
By not permitting Russia to disintegrate into anarchy or leading it back to authoritarianism, Yeltsin kept the way open for such a leader to one day emerge.
Unfortunately, that man is not his handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin, who has only perpetuated the vicious cycles of Russian history.

The Sugar Season
The holiday season that is now upon us is a time for festivity, and usually of overeating.
But the rampant consumption of sugar that marks this time of year is nothing to celebrate.
In fact, this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway.
Many countries, especially developing countries, are facing the consequences of huge changes in lifestyle: modifications in diet, lower levels of physical activity, and increased tobacco use.
These changes are determined, to a large extent, by the globalization and expansion of food markets, and by ever-greater levels of urbanization.
Both of these factors incite sedentary behavior at home and at work, as well as profound alterations in dietary habits.
So it should be no surprise that noncommunicable diseases (NCD's), including cardiovascular diseases (CVD's), obesity, diabetes and cancer, now kill roughly 33 million people around the world each year, and cause almost 60% of total deaths.
Indeed, they account for almost half the global burden of disease.
By 2020, that contribution is expected to rise to 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of disease.
Moreover, more than 60% these deaths occur in the developing world, and here NCD's increasingly appear in younger age groups, which can have huge implications for how productive a country's workers are.
Recent data from China reflect the extent of the problem.
In China's rural areas, with more than 800 million people, NDC's account for more than 80% of deaths.
Many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases.
Countries that still struggle with malnutrition and illnesses like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, now must contend with an explosion of CVD's, diabetes, and obesity, as well as soaring rates of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.
Indeed, five of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide are related to diet and physical activity: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low intake of fruit and vegetables, high body mass index, and insufficient exercise.
Clearly, effective strategies to tackle the NCD burden require a critical examination of what people are eating and their levels of physical activity.
The World Health Organization, together with a group of international experts, has developed a global strategy on diet, physical activity, and health over a period of 18 months through an extensive series of consultations in more than 80 countries, and with the input of United Nations bodies, civic groups, and food producers.
One of the strategy's key conclusions is that reducing the burden of NCD's requires a multi-sectoral approach.
Like a toolbox, the strategy provides WHO members with a comprehensive range of policy options from which to choose.
Governments can act.
Transport ministries should provide safe roads so that children can bike to school.
Finance ministers could tax unhealthy food and subsidize healthy food.
Education ministers should demand healthy school meals.
Many countries are already developing their own national strategies.
Most of what WHO is recommending has been endorsed by public health officials for many years.
But we face a global problem, with many international stakeholders, and this requires an urgent and worldwide response.
Of course, there is considerable debate about what precisely makes for a healthy diet.
This debate is both welcome and to be expected; improving diet and finding ways to increase physical activity is a complex issue.
Moreover. there will always be groups with their own interests, using arguments that we do not have sufficient evidence to act.
But there has been no challenge to the strategy's recommendations from the global scientific or public health community.
The strongest critique has come from sugar associations, who claim that the upper limit of 10% on caloric intake from sugar is not based upon scientific evidence.
However, more than twenty national and international reports from around the world by scientific bodies governing dietary recommendations set similar or lower targets for sugar intake.
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health.
The implementation of the WHO's strategy could lead to one of the largest-ever positive shifts in human health, putting populations throughout the world on pathways to lifelong and sustained improvements in well-being.

Doing Better on Climate Change
Los Angeles – Tackling global warming, we are often told, is the defining task of our age.
An army of pundits tells us that we need to cut emissions, and cut them immediately and drastically.
But this argument is clearly losing the battle for hearts and minds.
Global warming has now become the lowest-priority policy problem among Americans, according to a new Pew survey.
Another Pew survey showed that China, the world's biggest emitter, cares even less than the US about global warming. Just 24% of Chinese regard global warming as a very serious problem, making China the world's least concerned country.
In the UK, an Opinium survey shows that most voters think green taxes are mainly for raising cash rather than the environment, and 7 out of 10 are not willing to pay more in taxes to combat climate change.
At the same time, the proposed solutions for the problem of global warming have been awful.
In Rio de Janeiro in 1992, politicians from wealthy countries promised to cut emissions by 2000, but did no such thing.
Leaders met again in Kyoto in 1997 and promised even stricter carbon cuts by 2010, yet emissions keep increasing, and Kyoto has done virtually nothing to change that.
What is most tragic is that when leaders meet in Copenhagen this December, they will embrace more of the same solution: promises of even more drastic emission reductions that, once again, are unlikely to be fulfilled.
Measures that consistently over-promise and under-achieve at vast cost do not win hearts and minds in the best of times.
And this is manifestly not the best of times.
Fortunately, we have a much better option, with a much better chance of success: we should make low-carbon energy sources like solar power become a real, competitive alternative to old energy sources, instead of the preserve of rich people who want to feel “greener.”
We should therefore invest on an effective scale in inventing new technology.
Contrary to what one would imagine, the Kyoto Protocol has not prompted this research.
Indeed, research investment has plummeted since the 1980’s and has actually not increased since, even among Kyoto-participating countries.
Investing heavily in research and development of low-carbon energy, solar power, or other new technologies would become cheaper than fossil fuels much more quickly.
Economic estimates show that for every $1 spent, we would do $16 worth of good.
Every country should agree to spend 0.05% of its GDP on low-carbon energy R&D. The total global cost would be 15 times higher than current spending on alternative energy research, yet six times lower than the cost of Kyoto.
An agreement of this nature could be the new Kyoto treaty for the world – the principal difference being that this protocol would actually make a difference and stand a good chance of global acceptance.
Why not do both: invest in R&D, but still promise to cut carbon emissions now?
Kyoto-style policies can only ever be an expensive distraction from the real business of weaning us off fossil fuels.
There are two fundamental reasons why a focus on reducing carbon emissions is the wrong response to global warming.
First, using fossil fuels remains the only way out of poverty for developing countries.
Coal provides half of the world’s energy.
In China and India, it accounts for about 80% of power generation, and is helping Chinese and Indian laborers enjoy a quality of life that their parents could barely imagine.
Capping emissions means, effectively, ending this success story for hundreds of millions of people.
There is no “green” energy source that is affordable enough to replace coal in the near future.
Instead, our upsized research will make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels by mid-century.
Second, immediate carbon cuts are expensive – and the cost significantly outweighs the benefits.
If the Kyoto agreement had been fully implemented throughout this century, it would have cut temperatures only by an insignificant 0.2°C (0.3°F), at a cost of $180 billion every year.
In economic terms, Kyoto only does about 30 cents worth of good for each dollar spent.
And deeper emissions cuts like those proposed by the European Union – 20% below 1990 levels within 12 years – would reduce global temperatures by only one-sixtieth of one degree Celsius (one-thirtieth of one degree Fahrenheit) by 2100, at a cost of $10 trillion.
For every dollar spent, we would do just four cents worth of good.
The saddest thing about the global warming debate is that nearly all of the key protagonists – politicians, campaigners, and pundits – already know that the old-style agreement that is on the table for Copenhagen this December will have a negligible effect on temperatures.
Unless we change direction and make our actions realistic and achievable, it is already clear that the declarations of “success” in Copenhagen this December will be meaningless.
We will make promises.
We will not keep them.
And we will waste another decade.
Instead, we must challenge the orthodoxy of Kyoto.
We can do better.

The Right to Health Is Universal
GENEVA – On this year’s World AIDS Day, on December 1, we should remember the 35 million people who have died of AIDS-related illnesses, and the 76 million who have been infected with HIV since reporting began.
And we can celebrate the fact that nearly 21 million people living with HIV now have access to life-saving treatment.
But we also must not lose sight of the fact that more than 15.8 million people are still awaiting treatment, while an estimated 11 million people do not even know they have the virus.
In the time it takes to read this commentary, three more young women will have contracted HIV.
These figures represent an indefensible injustice: millions of people are being denied their right to health.
The third United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3) addresses health.
It aims to reduce road accidents; tackle non-communicable diseases; end AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases; guarantee universal health coverage and access to sexual and reproductive health-care services; and substantially reduce deaths from environmental pollution – all by 2030.
Although countries around the world have committed to this goal, countless people still inhale dangerous levels of toxic particles, and lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation.
Too many governments consistently fail to act on environmental and other regulatory issues, turn a blind eye to companies that profit from selling unhealthy and addictive products, and thus fail those whom they are supposed to protect and serve.
Health is neither a gift nor an act of charity.
It is a fundamental human right, encompassing both freedoms and entitlements.
Everyone is free to make decisions about their health, regardless of who they are, where they live, what they believe, or how they earn a living.
And everyone is entitled to affordable, quality health services and freedom from discrimination and coercion.
Enjoying the right to health means having one’s physical and mental integrity respected, and having the ability to participate and contribute to one’s community.
Today, we call on world leaders to confront health injustices wherever they see them, and to take action to respect, protect, and uphold the right to health for all people.
The ambitious SDG agenda for 2030 has afforded all of us the opportunity to shape policies aimed at creating and empowering the “global health citizen.”
Who is this citizen?
She is an individual who knows her rights and can voice her concerns, challenge injustices, and hold decision-makers accountable.
He is an individual who does not just ask for but demands access to doctors, treatments, or preventive care.
The global health citizen is one who becomes a part of the solution.
Empowering global health citizens will require progress in at least three policy areas: popularizing participation, democratizing data, and eliminating discrimination.
As to the first, we must open up health programs and policies to meaningful public engagement.
In the 1990s, the disability-rights movement coined the phrase, “Nothing about us without us.”
All global health citizens, and particularly health-care leaders, should adopt this mantra.
To be sure, public and private corruption remains a significant obstacle to ensuring the right to health for all people.
In many countries, health care is one of the most corrupt sectors.
To address this, global health citizens will need both institutional support and better tools for demanding that their right to health be respected.
They should start demanding more measures to ensure good governance and transparency, improve “legal” literacy, fund civil-society organizations, and reinforce legal mechanisms for holding governments accountable.
The second policy area where progress is needed is access to data for every community.
At UNAIDS, we follow the adage, “What gets measured gets done.”
Data analysis has proven to be one of the most potent tools in the fight against the HIV epidemic, because it enables us to raise awareness, identify people being left behind, guide investment, and coordinate action.
We in the global health field have always been good at estimating mortality and morbidity rates.
But it is now time to look beyond epidemiological facts.
Guaranteeing the right to health will require us also to monitor the effects of discrimination and stigmatization, as well as laws and environmental factors that threaten people’s health and wellbeing.
Likewise, conducting thorough assessments of the health impact of key policies and investments must become the norm, rather than the exception.
The global health sector needs far more independent advocacy and accountability, which the UN and civil-society groups, in particular, are in a strong position to provide.
The third policy area – eliminating discrimination in health-care settings – must become an international priority.
The central promise of the SDG agenda is to leave no one behind.
Discrimination creates de facto barriers to universal health coverage, and prevents many people from accessing health services of any kind.
For example, one in eight people responding to the HIV Stigma Index say they have been denied health care as a result of prejudice.
It is clear that ending AIDS will require social – not just medical – breakthroughs.
Governments must redouble their efforts to protect individuals against discrimination, and create effective mechanisms for people to seek redress when private or state actors violate their right to health.
We call on all health-care practitioners and institutions to resist discriminatory laws, policies, or practices.
Safeguarding the right to health provides the foundation needed to enable everyone to realize their potential and their dreams.
We should demand nothing less.

Big Money Merges with Big Brother
PARIS – All over the world, Internet users entertain romantic delusions about cyberspace.
To most of us Web surfers, the Internet provides a false sense of complete freedom, power, and anonymity.
Every once in a while, of course, unsolicited messages and ads that happen to be mysteriously related to our most intimate habits intrude.
They remind us that we Internet users are, indeed, under constant virtual surveillance.
When the watchers have only commercial motives, such “spam” feels like a minor violation.
But in China or Russia, the Internet is patrolled not by unsolicited peddlers, but by the police.
So Russian human-rights activists and the environmental organization Baikal Environmental Wave should not have been surprised when, earlier this month, flesh and blood policemen – not Internet bots – confiscated their computers and the files stored within them.
In the time of the Soviet Union, the KGB would have indicted these anti-Putin dissidents for mental disorders.
This supposedly being a “new Russia,” cyber-dissidents are accused of violating intellectual property rights.
You see, they were using Microsoft-equipped computers and could not prove that the software had not been pirated.
By confiscating the computers, the Russian police could supposedly verify whether or not the Microsoft software that the activists were using had been installed legally.
On the surface, Microsoft and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s police look like strange bedfellows.
But are they?
Microsoft’s authorized representatives declared that they could not oppose the Russian police actions, because the Seattle-based company had to abide by Russian law.
Such an ambiguous declaration can be interpreted either as active support for the Russian police or as passive collaboration.
Moreover, in previous cases, Microsoft assisted the Russian police in their investigations of non-governmental organizations.
Clearly, human-right activists in Russia cannot and should not count on Microsoft as an ally in their efforts to build a more open society. But Microsoft’s ambiguous – at best – behavior is part of a pattern.
Indeed, the record of Internet companies in authoritarian countries is both consistent and grim.
Yahoo set the pace in pioneering the active collaboration of Internet and high-tech firms with political repression.
In 2005, Yahoo gave the Chinese police the computer identification code for a dissident journalist, Shi Tao.
Shi Tao had sent a message in praise of democracy, which the censors had detected.
Following Yahoo’s lead, the police arrested him.
Shi remains in jail to this day.
At that time, Yahoo’s managers in the United States, like Microsoft in Russia, declared that they had to follow Chinese law.
Shi Tao, in his jail cell, was undoubtedly pleased to learn that China is ruled by law, not by the Communist Party.
After all, the rule of law is what Shi Tao is fighting for.
Google, at least for a short while, seemed to follow different guidelines in its Chinese business, appearing to adhere to its widely proclaimed ethical principle, “Don’t be evil.”
To protest against censorship, the Silicon Valley-based company relocated from mainland China in 2009 to the still relatively free Hong Kong.
On the Hong Kong-based search engine, Chinese internauts could read about Taiwan, the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, or the Dalai Lama.
On Google.cn, these sources, along with the results of searches using many other forbidden terms, simply did not appear.
Google’s move seemed to reconcile its proclaimed libertarian philosophy with its business ethics.
But that reconciliation did not last long: Google, after all, had accepted censorship from the beginning of its efforts in China, in 2006, in order to gain entry into the Chinese market.
After six months of life in Hong Kong, money talked: Google reinstated its mainland China service, and with the same level of censorship as before.
In the end, Google, not the Chinese Communist Party, lost face.
Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft have thus followed a strikingly similar road: access to lucrative markets trumped ethical anxiety.
The tools that they provide are politically neutral.
Dissidents try to use them to pursue a democratic agenda.
Police use them to detect and repress dissidents.
Either way, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google make money – just like, say, IBM, which in the 1930’s sold its computing machines to the Nazi regime: the Nazis used these machines to make the destruction of their victims routine and bureaucratic.
Should we be shocked that Internet companies put profits ahead of morals?
After all, they are ordinary, profit-seeking corporations, just like the IBM of Hitler’s era.
Internet companies may, more than most, hide their true motives behind ersatz, democratic-sounding slogans, but in the end they are advertising products like any other. In advertising or self-promotion, the choice of words is determined by customer expectations, not by managers’ philosophy, as they mostly have none.
Capitalism is always a trade-off: we must live with unethical behavior by money-making corporations that provide us with useful new tools.
These tools can be used by Iranians fighting dictatorship, or by Tibetan dissidents trying to save their culture.
They also can be used to compute the number of exterminated Jews, to arrest a Chinese dissident, or to break a human-rights group in Russia.
Microsoft in Russia or Google in China teach us that capitalism is not ethical: it is only efficient.
Entrepreneurs are greedy by definition: if they were not, they would go bankrupt.
An open society will never be created or sustained by righteous entrepreneurs or be the mere byproduct of political engineering.
Liberty, as always, remains the endeavor of vigilant, free men and women.

Taking Sides in the War Within Islam
PARIS – French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was right when he recently said that there is no good excuse for jihadism.
Rejecting the culture of excuses, said Valls, also meant resisting the temptation to dwell on explanations of the jihadist impulse.
And Valls was right again on April 4 when he warned against the danger of an ideological victory for Salafism, the doctrine underlying jihadism, which views Europe (and, within Europe, France) as prime ground for proselytization.
Successive French governments, over three decades, abdicated responsibility for engaging in this debate.
But while passivity may have ensured social peace in the short term, it enabled values other than those of the republic to take root in wide swaths of French cities.
And this was followed by willful blindness, as governments refused to recognize that militant Islamic fundamentalism was actually Islamo-fascism, the third global variant of totalitarianism that diehard critics had been decrying for a quarter-century.
This failure of government was abetted by the complicit myopia prevailing at the extremes of the political spectrum.
In 2012, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, lumped together (in order to condemn them both) the religious symbol that is the yarmulke and the political emblem that is the veil.
And just this month, Green Senator Esther Benbassa claimed that a miniskirt is no less alienating than a chador. What were Le Pen and Benbassa doing if not making acceptable a form of barbarism whose occasionally human face should never allow us to forget that people are killing, maiming, and raping in its name?
Compounding the problem is the well-known advantage that extremists have over moderates, by virtue of yelling the loudest.
Just as the Montagnards drowned out the Girondins in the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution, the rabid jihadists are drowning out the large number of Muslims who want nothing more than to be left alone to practice their faith in peace and with respect for others and the law.
And finally, there is the timorous backpedaling we tend to see from our leaders whenever religious fanatics stigmatize those who offend them.
Yesterday it was the Indian novelist Salman Rushdie; today it is the Algerian novelist Kamel Daoud.
The first reflex of too many leaders at such times is to stigmatize the victims a second time, by suggesting that they were asking for it.
In any event, the result is plain: Appeasement of violent radicalism only encourages more of the same.
As a consequence, we find ourselves in an undeclared state of intellectual emergency, one that, regrettably, has given rise to the states of emergency that our governments proclaim in the wake of terrorist attacks.
Dealing with this emergency requires, above all, saying and doing the opposite of what has most often been said and done.
Specifically, we must call a spade a spade.
An Islamist may be a lost Muslim or a Muslim gone astray, but he or she is a Muslim all the same.
We must stop repeating ad nauseam that these aberrant Muslims have “nothing to do with Islam.”
In other words, we must acknowledge that two Islams are locked in a fight to the death, and that because the battlefield is the planet and the war threatens values that the West embraces, the fight is not solely the Muslims’ affair.
Once we do that, we must devote ourselves to identifying, untangling, and exposing the networks of Islamic hate and terror with the same energy and ingenuity that are now being applied to unraveling the global schemes of tax evaders.
How long will we have to wait for the Panama Papers of Salafism?
What is stopping the great newspapers from flushing out from the dark web the Mossack Fonsecas of global jihad and its criminal offshore companies?
We must also aid, encourage, and ideologically arm Muslims who reject the Islam of hate in favor of an Islam respectful of women, their faces, and their rights, as well as of human rights in general.
Is that not what we did in the not-so-distant past with regard to the brave people we called dissidents in the Soviet world?
And were we not right, at the time, to ignore those who told us that the dissidents were a minority who would never, ever, prevail against the granite ideology of communism?
That means protecting and defending Daoud (to take just one current example), a French-language writer of Muslim origin who suggested that those seeking sanctuary in Europe would do well to learn to appreciate European values.
For that, Daoud has been saddled with a double fatwa: one from his “assassin brothers,” to borrow the Algerian-French journalist Mohamed Sifaoui’s phrase, and another from a handful of supposedly progressive and anti-racist French intellectuals who accused him of “recycling the most hackneyed clichés of Orientalism” when he urged Arab men to respect the dignity of women.
Genuine anti-racists, anti-imperialists, and believers in republican democracy must take the side of the Islam of moderation and peace in its war against the criminal Islam of the Salafists.
It is a war that is ideological, theological, and political, a war that cuts across worlds, cultures, and what we are right to call civilizations, from the lost city neighborhoods of France to those areas – for example, Kurdistan, Morocco, Bosnia, and Bangladesh – where enlightened Islam remains alive and well. That, in broad strokes, is our urgent task.
This is our war.

China’s Long View
NEW HAVEN – A couple of months ago, while touring Jiangxi Province, Chinese President Xi Jinping made reference to an old revolutionary milestone. “Now there is a new Long March, and we should make a new start,” he said in response to the mounting economic conflict with the United States.
In China, symbolism is often more important than literal interpretation of leaders’ elliptical statements.
Spoken in the same province where the Long March commenced in 1934, ultimately leading to Mao’s defeat of the Nationalists 15 years later, Xi’s reminder underscored China’s greatest strength: the long view.
That strength was on display during my latest visit to China in early July.
In a series of wide-ranging meetings and discussions, three conclusions stood out. Each challenges America’s bipartisan demonization of China.
First, slowing growth is not the source of fear for China’s leaders that many Western policymakers seem to think it is.
Yes, in historical perspective, the latest GDP report was weak: quarterly growth was the slowest since the current statistical reporting system was adopted in 1992, and even worse than that recorded a decade ago, in the depths of the global financial crisis.
But the 6.2% rate for the second quarter of 2019 was a relatively mild deceleration of 0.5 percentage point from the relatively subdued 6.7% average pace of the previous eight quarters.
By contrast, the slowing to 6.6% in the first quarter of 2009 was a far more abrupt deceleration of 5.5 percentage points from the average gain of 12.1% over the preceding eight quarters.
A modest slowing is not a growth collapse by any stretch of the imagination.
That should not be surprising.
China has more policy levers than growth headwinds.
With ample room for further monetary easing, infrastructure spending, and other forms of fiscal stimulus, Chinese authorities are far less concerned about a sudden growth accident than the US narrative would lead one to believe.
Moreover, Washington’s fixation on who is winning the trade war overlooks a critically important structural shift in the Chinese economy.
In 2018, net exports were just 0.8% of China’s GDP, which represents a dramatic compression from a decade earlier, when net exports accounted for fully 7.5% of real GDP.
While hardly an oasis in a weakening global economy, China is far less exposed to a trade shock today than it was back then.
Even if it loses a trade war – a debatable proposition – damage to China’s overall economic growth would be minimal.
At the same time, the May 24 Baoshang Bank failure – a first for China in about 20 years – has triggered a worrisome outbreak of counterparty risk contagion.
With bad debts ballooning in excess of 30%, this privately-owned Inner Mongolian midsize institution was apparently victimized by corrupt management.
A well-coordinated takeover by China’s financial regulators and the central bank appears to have contained the direct damage while sending an important moral hazard signal to undisciplined lenders.
But the interbank borrowing market is still shaky, with spillovers to smaller banks, including those in rural areas.
Ironically, China may be better able to manage trade risks than instability in its financial system.
The second conclusion that stood out from my recent discussions is that China is patient and methodical in dealing with external wildcards – especially US politics.
Chinese officials are not about to bet on the 2020 US presidential election in formulating their strategic response to the trade conflict.
Obviously, there is great interest in the outcome; but in keeping with Xi’s Long March imagery, China’s leadership is preparing for an enduring Cold-War-like confrontation, irrespective of who wins the election.
Significantly, many senior Chinese officials don’t share the US consensus view that America’s post-2020 China policy trajectory will stay its current course – Donald Trump or not.
In the event that Trump loses, the Chinese suspect that US foreign policy will shift back to a more multilateral, alliance-focused approach.
Their biggest hope is for a restoration of integrity to the policymaking process itself.
Like many in the US, the Chinese find it difficult to deal with unpredictable, almost whimsical, shifts in tariffs and sanctions.
Even if a new president were to remain tough on China, a coherent and well-articulated US strategy would be far more effective in framing the debate and offering hope for constructive resolution of grievances.
Third, Huawei is a big deal for China.
The tech giant is perceived to be a national champion and emblematic of China’s push toward indigenous innovation, which is central to its longer-term growth and development aspirations.
By taking advantage of its “choke point” position in the Huawei supply chain, the Trump administration’s China containment campaign is seen as seeking to stifle those aspirations.
There is no question that Huawei is feeling the heat as the US squeezes the supply-chain by putting pressure on America’s leading suppliers of semiconductor chips, other components, and software – companies such as AMD, IBM, Marvell, Intel, Google, and Microsoft.
According to Huawei’s management, the company’s earnings this year and next will be about $30 billion below projections.
While senior US officials have sent mixed signals about relaxing restrictions on Huawei, the weaponization of US trade policy has sent a clear message to China: the need to address the supply-chain vulnerability of its leading-edge technology companies is now a top policy priority.
The conventional wisdom in the West is that China will need ten years to build a domestic chip and software industry that could fill the void created by US restrictions.
The Chinese I spoke with in early July felt that the gap could be closed much sooner, possibly within two years.
If anything, Trump’s threats against Huawei have served as a wake-up call to Xi’s “self-reliance” campaign.
The US chokehold could be surprisingly short-lived.
Time and again, the long view in China has stood in sharp contrast to America’s short-term approach.
Needless to say, this has become all the more evident during the past two and a half years of Trump’s Twitter-driven policy gambits.
One senior Chinese policymaker actually admitted to checking Trump’s Twitter feed each morning.
No surprise there.
Sun Tzu put it best in his ancient treatise, The Art of War: “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.”

Argentina and How to Avoid Global Financial Catastrophe
NEW YORK – When a single car skids on an icy highway, the result can be a 50-car wreck.
So, too, with international financial markets: Mexico’s default in 1982 led to a pile-up of dozens of countries.
Thailand’s devaluation in July 1997 triggered the Asian financial crisis.
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008 set off the Great Recession around the world.
International financiers should know better than to start the COVID-19 collapse of 2020.
Their wisdom will soon be tested.
Even before COVID-19 threw the world economy into the worst downturn since the Great Depression, Argentina was in debt distress, again.
As so often has happened in Argentina’s default-ridden history, a half-baked agreement with recalcitrant creditors in 2016, followed by a quick return to the bond markets, proved to be wishful thinking both for Argentina’s then-president and the country’s creditors.
Fiscal deficits undermined stability.
A 2018 bailout program with the International Monetary Fund did not work.
And Argentina’s debts, with their very high coupon rates, proved to be unsustainable.
Yet Argentina was hardly alone.
As lax lending standards by financial markets and ample liquidity pumped out by the Fed and other central banks led many developing countries to borrow heavily in recent years, sovereign-debt distress was increasingly recognized to be a major systemic risk.
A session at the 2019 IMF Spring Meetings was entitled “Tackling the Next Wave of Sovereign Debt Crises.”
Enter COVID-19.
The collapse of oil prices in March, the onset of a near-global lockdown, plummeting government revenues, and gargantuan public spending for the survival of populations produced a global fiscal crisis unmatched in peacetime.
The US budget deficit will soar to around 18% of GDP or higher.
For dozens of emerging economies, the financial panorama could not be bleaker.
Yet even in this context, Argentina made a debt-restructuring offer to its creditors that is realistic and favorable.
Its creditors should respond positively.
Here is how it works.
Argentina’s existing debt carries an average coupon rate of 7%, which is roughly seven percentage points higher than the zero coupon paid by Germany on its 30-year government bonds, and roughly six points higher than the 1.2% coupon paid by the US Treasury.
Argentina has rightly noted that the 7% coupon rate would necessitate a default. The IMF has agreed that it is unsustainably high.
Few if any governments – not even the United States – could manage to service a 7% coupon rate in this economic environment.
Argentina creditors say that they need a 7% coupon, or even higher, because of the likelihood of default.
But they seem not to understand that if Argentina’s coupon is cut to near the US rate, then a default is not necessary.
The sky-high 7% coupon rate is a self-fulfilling prophecy: It makes default inevitable, whereas a lower interest rate would make it unnecessary.
Argentina has offered to refinance the current debt at low safe interest rates, thereby avoiding the need to impose a “haircut” on the principal.
(Actually, to conform to Argentine law, the exchange offer includes a small, symbolic reduction of the debt’s face value that, in my view, should be eliminated in any final deal.)
Like a home-mortgage refinancing, the existing bonds would be replaced by bonds that reflect today’s low interest rates.
But, rather than a coupon rate equal to the US Treasury rate, Argentina is offering an average 2.3% coupon rate, higher than the returns on Treasuries in its creditors’ portfolios.
There are details on grace periods and the time paths of coupon payments that should be negotiated, honed, and finalized in light of the grim and evolving economic realities.
But the creditors are an odd bunch.
They claim that Argentina is imposing a significant haircut, even though there is essentially none.
Argentina’s government is offering a safe return that is higher than the US safe interest rate, and the logic of its offer is correct.
Why should it stick with a sky-high interest rate that causes the default risk on which it is based? And why should creditors prefer a default by Argentina to an economic recovery?
The creditors calculate the alleged haircut in Argentina’s offer by using a discount rate of 10-12%, as if they deserve a risk-fee return of 10% or higher when the US Treasury bond rate is just above 1%.
The financial press plays along, dutifully reporting that Argentina is forcing a deep haircut on creditors when it is doing no such thing.
In fact, Argentina is reducing a default-prone coupon rate to a default-free coupon rate.
I would go one step further.
Some friendly official creditors or multilateral institution could sweeten the deal by guaranteeing some or all of Argentina’s payments on the new bonds.
Such a guarantee would be a completely safe bet: with the low coupon rate and new maturity structure, Argentina would not default.
Global financial markets tend to panic when even one country, much less several, begins skidding.
There are probably 30-40 countries in deep fiscal distress now.
They all need to refinance their debts this year and next, until recovery from the pandemic revives global economic activity, restores government revenues, and reduces the need for emergency outlays.
In such situations, collective rationality in financial markets requires guidance from the IMF and leadership from a few major creditors.
Otherwise, a creditor grab race (a variant of the prisoner’s dilemma) ensues.
Each creditor says to the others: “You refinance the debt while I get repaid, thank you.”
If handled with care, this year’s debt-service payments can and should be recapitalized at low interest rates to avoid a financial pile-up.
If not, 2020 will mark a devastating new episode of global financial crisis.
In the Panic of 1907, it was J. Pierpont Morgan and his bank that guided the financial system back from the brink.
In 2020, it must be BlackRock, which had $6.5 trillion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter and is one of Argentina’s major creditors.
BlackRock could guide bondholders to refinance Argentina’s debt at a safe coupon rate, and do likewise with other pandemic-distressed sovereign borrowers.
Over to you, Larry Fink. It’s your turn to help prevent a global financial catastrophe.

Where America's Fiscal Debate Goes Off the Rails
BERKELEY – The US Congress has just taken an important step toward implementing President Joe Biden’s fiscal plans, by passing a signature $1 trillion infrastructure bill.
Now we will see whether the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its non-partisan wisdom, agrees that the companion plan for $1.75 trillion in social and climate-related spending is fully financed by additional taxes and other “pay fors,” as moderate Democrats evidently require.
At one level, this is precisely the debate the country needs.
It is a debate, fundamentally, about what kind of society the United States should be and about the appropriate role of government.
Should government, to address inequality, provide more support for childcare because it enables women to enter the labor force and fosters healthy childhood development, especially among disadvantaged youth?
Or should it avoid doing so, as some argue, because taking childcare out of the household weakens families?
Similarly, should the federal government, to combat climate change, invest in a network of charging stations for electric vehicles, just as it invested in the interstate highway system?
Or is this a problem that can be left to the market, notwithstanding the existence of network effects?
Recent debates remind us that there is less than full agreement on the desirability of such programs.
But where there should be agreement is on how best to finance them.
And here the debate has been derailed by warrantless fears of fiscal disaster.
Republicans and so-called moderate Democrats insist that neither physical nor social infrastructure should be deficit-financed.
Having doled out trillions of dollars in pandemic relief, the US already has yawning deficits and crushing debts.
In the view of opponents, it cannot afford more.
What this argument misses is that here the debate is about public investment, not only transfer payments and public consumption.
Productive public investments pay for themselves if they grow the denominator of the debt/GDP ratio.
This is most obviously the case of physical infrastructure that makes it easier to offload containers, truck them to warehouses, and distribute their contents, enabling producers to realize the efficiencies of global supply chains.
Better infrastructure boosts GDP, which means more tax revenues for servicing and retiring debt.
But the point applies equally to investment in social infrastructure: Pre-K and lifelong learning yield a more productive workforce.
It also applies to investments in climate-change abatement and adaptation insofar as these expenditures prevent destructive climate events that cause GDP to fall.
The debate about these programs tends to be framed in terms of values.
But it should also be a debate over rates of return and about which investments pay for themselves.
European countries, including Germany, are having this discussion.
Why the US is not having it is something of a mystery.
Or maybe it’s less a mystery than yet another indication of the difficulty of having any rational, informed Congressional debate, whatever the issue.
But wouldn’t more deficit spending create excess demand, aggravating an already worrisome inflation problem?
In fact, many earlier programs fueling the deficit are set to expire at the end of the year.
CBO calculations project that the deficit as a share of GDP will fall from 13.4% this year to 4.7% in 2022.
This is an alarming amount of “fiscal drag.”
Everyone is fixated on inflation and the Federal Reserve, but maybe they should be asking how, with the government vaporizing 9% of GDP, this lost spending will be made up.
But isn’t debt spiraling out of control?
Having rocketed past 100% of GDP, public debt in the hands of the public is at unprecedented levels.
Yet debt service as a share of GDP has barely budged since the turn of the century, because interest rates today are just a third as high.
On current law, the CBO sees publicly held debt as a share of GDP falling between 2022 and 2024, as the economy expands and interest rates trend up only modestly.
In fact, between now and the end of the decade, the CBO’s projections show debt in the hands of the public as a share of GDP – wait for it – falling from 102.7% this year to 102.6%.
In other words, there is no immediate crisis of debt sustainability.
Prudent governments budget for surprises.
An energy shock or geopolitical event could precipitate a recession.
There could be another novel coronavirus.
Interest rates could rise faster than expected.
It has happened before.
It is entirely appropriate for governments to borrow to finance essential spending during an emergency.
And once the emergency has passed, it is equally essential for governments to restore and enhance their ability to borrow so that they can deploy the same fiscal resources when the next crisis hits.
The challenge for the US is to do so gradually, so that consolidation of public finances does not aggravate an already existing problem of fiscal drag.
And that means not sacrificing productive public investments that more than pay for themselves.

Antibiotics That Work
MEXICO CITY – From the discovery of penicillin in 1928 to the introduction of the last of the main groups of antibiotics in the 1960s, humanity’s capacity to fight pathogenic bacteria has been transformative.
But, over time, the number of antibiotics to which bacteria are susceptible has been dwindling, and some pathogens have become resistant to most or all existing drugs.
As a result, once-treatable infections are becoming deadly again.
Already, antibiotic resistance is leading to an estimated 700,000 deaths per year, with financial costs reaching tens of billions of dollars.
As antibiotic resistance continues to undermine our ability to treat cancers, transplant organs, and implant prosthesis, these figures will only rise.
Many factors have contributed to rising antibiotic resistance.
Bacteria can reproduce and mutate rapidly, and they can establish something of a “genetic Internet” that enables certain pathogenic bacteria to “download” antibiotic-resistant genes.
Moreover, most antibiotics are natural products of soil bacteria, in which antibiotic resistance can occur naturally.
When human-made antibiotics were introduced on a massive scale, the bacteria with resistance became the most prevalent.
Today, humans release about 100,000 tons of antibiotics per year.
If those antibiotics were being used properly and saving lives, a reasonable cost-benefit analysis might be possible.
But about 70% of them are used to make farm animals to grow a bit faster.
The other 30%, while used to treat people, are often prescribed incorrectly or needlessly.
And, because a substantial share of the used drugs are released into the environment with wastewater and manure, bacterial communities in soils, waters, and wildlife are also exposed.
If this abuse of antibiotics does not end, we will soon find ourselves without drugs to treat bacterial infections effectively.
But while some steps are being taken – a high-level United Nations meeting last September produced proposals for some international measures – they are far from adequate.
What is really needed is an immediate worldwide ban on the agricultural use of antibiotics.
Moreover, guidelines for the clinical use of antibiotics, which the medical community now follows as closely as those concerning how to pick a necktie, must be reviewed and strongly enforced.
These two measures alone – both of which could be enacted by governmental regulatory agencies – would reduce the use of antibiotics by nearly 80%, slowing the rise of antibiotic resistance substantially.
Of course, getting governments to implement such measures will not be easy, because they run counter to powerful economic interests, the most obvious being the pharmaceutical industry, which sells $40 billion worth of antibiotics each year.
While Big Pharma has a strong interest in continued antibiotic abuse, it has little interest in developing new antibiotics to tackle drug-resistant bacteria.
Drugs for chronic illnesses and cancer are better for their bottom line.
So Big Pharma is seeking “incentives” to pursue research and development of new antibiotics, such as extended patents or tax breaks; the alternative would be to charge astronomical prices for new drugs.
But the benefits of such incentives for pharmaceutical companies would far exceed the cost of the actual R&D pursued; they would be instruments to funnel public funds into private hands – the very hands that caused the problem.
Beyond all of these carrots, however, societies should consider using some sticks.
I propose an initiative that rates pharmaceutical companies according to their contribution to solving the antibiotic-resistance problem; those that do not contribute should be punished with fewer sales.
I call it NANBU (No Antibiotics, No Business).
NANBU would grant points to companies with vigorous research programs or with new antibiotics in the development pipeline.
Companies that do not manufacture or sell antibiotics for agricultural purposes, or that refuse to promote the use of antibiotics for diseases that do not require such drugs, would gain points as well.
Those that engaged in the opposite behaviors – selling antibiotics as livestock “growth promoters” or actively encouraging physicians to prescribe the drugs – would lose points.
At first, virtually all drug companies would have negative scores.
But, over time, the ratings could be adjusted, always according to scientifically sound advice from an independent group of experts.
The ratings could then be used to guide drug-purchasing decisions.
For many kinds of relevant drugs, there are several options with similar efficacy and safety, produced by different companies.
So clinicians could prescribe drugs mostly from highly rated companies, and avoid drugs from companies with low ratings.
Patients could encourage such decision-making, and follow suit when purchasing over-the-counter drugs.
Over time, antibiotics could become more profitable again, as engaged companies sell more of their other drugs and the need for costly incentives diminishes.
The key to NANBU’s success will be to ensure widespread understanding of the antibiotic-resistance threat and what is needed to combat it.
This would give patients and doctors the impetus to regard NANBU ratings in making drug decisions, as well as to pressure their governments to take even stronger action.
The use of a public awareness campaign to intensify pressure on governments to pursue necessary but difficult measures has worked before – for example, in advancing forest and fishery sustainability.
Public awareness was among the priorities highlighted at the UN meeting.
To carry out that global effort, however, we need a new global institution that really is up to the task.
NANBU, as an international NGO, would be able to cope with the transnational nature of most drug companies, while being protected from national-level lobbying or political pressure.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria represent a global threat, and therefore cannot be addressed with national measures alone.
The world must think and act together to preserve the huge gains to human health and wellbeing that antibiotics have enabled.

The Middle East Must Lead on Refugees
FEZ – Since 2012, more than 12 million migrants and refugees have landed in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.
The result has been an escalating political and humanitarian crisis – and increasingly heated debate about how to address it.
In Europe, the debate is characterized by dissent and division, exemplified by the United Kingdom’s recent vote to leave the European Union – an outcome that was shaped largely by overblown fears about immigration.
With EU member states failing to agree on how to secure external borders, much less what to do with the refugees who have already arrived, an effective, unified response has proved elusive.
In the Middle East, the refugee debate is not nearly as loud, but it is no less passionate.
Jordan, a country of 6.5 million, now hosts more than 1.4 million, mostly Syrian, refugees.
Lebanon’s 1.5 million Syrian refugees represent nearly one-third of the country’s population of 4.7 million.
Turkey, with some 75 million citizens, now hosts 2.7 million Syrian refugees, about 30% of whom live in 22 government-run camps near the Syrian border.
With most of the refugees originating in the Middle East – especially Syria, but also Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya – the fact that the region is shouldering the overwhelming share of the burden is not surprising.
But not all Middle Eastern countries have done enough.
The Gulf countries, despite their vast oil wealth, have taken in hardly any refugees; they contend that, because they are not parties to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, they have no obligation to do so.
The United Arab Emirates, for example, has taken in just over 200,000 Syrian nationals since the Syrian crisis began in 2011.
Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria permit Syrian refugees to enter, but provide no support to those who do; there are no refugees camps in these countries.
Meanwhile, their neighbors are straining under the weight of the crisis.
Already, Jordan’s social-welfare budget is reaching a breaking point, spurring social tensions.
Schools in both Jordan and Lebanon were overcrowded even before the refugees arrived; now they are bursting at the seams.
Even the refugees who work in Jordan and Lebanon are creating problems, as they inadvertently suppress wages for lower-skill jobs.
Turkey’s government has delivered more than $8 billion in aid; by contrast, the EU has delivered only a small share of the €3.2 billion ($3.6 billion) it pledged last November.
With host countries overstretched, it is unsurprising that refugees live in rough conditions, whether in camps or very poor neighborhoods, with no amenities or sanitation.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees are unemployed, including the most highly skilled among them, whose qualifications are often not recognized.
As a result, forced labor, slavery, prostitution, and social exclusion are on the rise.
Keeping the migrants largely in the Middle East is critical – not least to prevent them from drowning in the Mediterranean in their attempt to reach Europe.
The Turkey-EU agreement concluded last March – according to which non-refugee migrants who reach the EU are sent to Turkey – has helped, contributing to a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Greece.
But much more needs to be done – and Middle Eastern countries should take the lead.
Most urgently, the wealthy Gulf states should provide more funding to the countries that are hosting the most refugees, thereby enabling them to begin improving living conditions for those seeking safety.
Then, in order to develop a more comprehensive solution that keeps countries stable and ensures that refugees receive adequate protection, deeper collaboration among governments, as well as with the private sector and civil-society organizations across the region, is needed.
The problem is that there is no consensus in the Middle East, either among governments or civil society, about how to respond to the crisis.
To break the impasse, one or two bold and far-sighted leaders need to remind their citizens of their countries’ legal and, perhaps more important, moral duties to the refugees.
The Islamic tradition of protecting the welfare of the poor can provide the language and legitimacy needed to inspire citizens to do their part.
In my book New Horizons of Muslim Diaspora in North America and Europe, I argue against the conventional wisdom that migrants and refugees are a threat to the Middle East’s security and development.
Just like in the developed countries of the West, migrants in the Middle East can offer untold contributions to their host societies.
We just need to let them.
Above all, the refugees’ basic needs must be met.
Decent living conditions – including housing, nutrition, and health care – must be guaranteed, in addition to educational and employment opportunities.
If a few countries continue to shoulder the entire burden, however, it will be virtually impossible to meet the refugees’ needs.
Given this, the region needs to develop a mechanism for distributing refugees more fairly across countries, something like the EU’s quota system.
Standardized and streamlined procedures for handling asylum applications must also be implemented.
Even if all of this is achieved, a truly sustainable solution to the refugee crisis will not come until Syria is at peace, and order is restored in failing states across the Middle East.
That is why it is so important for the region’s governments to play a bigger and more assertive role in tackling the violence and instability that lies at the root of the crisis.
We cannot afford to wait for outside powers to resolve our most pressing problems.
Our governments must invest heavily in our neighbors’ stability, including by bringing the Syrian peace process to a successful conclusion, and in the wellbeing of all of our citizens.

The Wrong Way to Educate Girls
PARIS – Recent decades have brought significant progress toward a more just and equal world in areas such as poverty reduction, immunization, and life expectancy.
But in some areas, change has been painfully slow.
In one such area – gender equality in education – the problem is as straightforward as it is profound: we are focusing on the wrong metric.
Of course, there is good news.
As the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring (GEM) 2019 Gender Report notes, the number of adult illiterate women in upper-middle-income countries fell by 42 million from 2000 to 2016.
And progress on enrollment in most countries means that richer countries increasingly face the opposite challenge, as more boys than girls do not complete secondary education.
These disparities expose the limitations of the current approach, which focuses on gender parity – that is, ensuring that equal numbers of boys and girls attend school.
Of course, getting girls into classrooms remains hugely important in some of the world’s poorest countries, and it can be achieved with targeted measures, say, to make their daily commute safer.
Among the 20 countries with the largest such disparities, Guinea, Niger, and Somalia stand out for their commitment to closing the gap.
But balanced school enrollment numbers are only the beginning.
There is also a need to address the underlying causes of unequal educational outcomes.
In low-income countries, this means assessing what happens in school and the opportunities available after completion – both of which are shaped by social attitudes about gender.
Around the world, girls and women constantly receive the message that their primary role should be that of caregiver.
In the sixth World Values Survey, carried out between 2010 and 2014 in 51 countries, half of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “when a woman works for pay, the children suffer.”
Given these perceptions, families and communities are less likely to place a high priority on girls’ education.
The same survey found that one in four people worldwide still believe that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl.
This message is reinforced in schools.
Students study from textbooks that reinforce stereotypes and omit women’s historical contributions.
And while the majority of teachers are women, school leaders are usually men.
It is probably not surprising, then, that even those girls who do receive some education are more likely to pursue traditionally “feminine” career paths, including domestic and caring professions.
Women account for just over a quarter of those enrolled in engineering, manufacturing and construction, and information and communications technology programs.
Such gendered expectations also often lead to permissive attitudes – not only socially, but also legally – toward child marriage, early pregnancy, domestic work, and even sexual violence, including at school.
At least 117 countries and territories still allow children to marry.
Four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa prohibit girls from returning to school during or after a pregnancy.
And girls in most countries are more than twice as likely as boys to be involved in child domestic work.
All of this severely limits the prospects of girls and women, leaving them economically, socially, and physically vulnerable.
If we want to protect girls’ rights, including their right to an education, we need to act to change damaging policies and the social norms that underpin them.
For example, education strategies should include relevant revisions to curricula and textbooks.
But in 16 of 20 countries with the largest gender disparity that we analyzed, such considerations are not on authorities’ agenda.
Angola, the Central African Republic, Djibouti, and Mauritania barely mention gender at all in their education strategies.
Development partners can play a powerful role in changing this reality.
In 2017, a little over half of total direct education aid included gender equality and women’s empowerment as either a principal or significant objective.
If donors emphasized the types of comprehensive, attitude-shaping changes that are needed – as well as the imperative of creating solutions that are scalable, replicable, and participatory – they could help to spur the development of responsive government strategies and sustainable public programs that serve everyone.
The world recognizes the benefits of delivering education to all: the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals include the target of eliminating gender disparities in education by 2030.
But if those benefits are to be secured, we must acknowledge the shortcomings of an approach focused on enrollment figures.
The GEM Report has already adopted a new framework for monitoring gender equality in education.
Countries and donors should do the same – and adjust their education strategies accordingly.

The Neglected Solution to the TB Crisis
BOSTON/GENEVA – In an age of rapid technological innovation, it is shameful that almost two million people will die from tuberculosis this year because they are too poor to afford treatment.
Indeed, the reason why TB continues to take lives is simple: indifference.
This indifference stems from the deadly delusion that TB is a disease of the past – a delusion that has persisted, even as 10.4 million people contracted TB in 2016.
TB patients are generally powerless to demand the world’s attention.
Though the disease can strike anyone, it disproportionately afflicts marginalized and vulnerable populations in places like refugee camps, slums, and prisons.
Another delusion is that we have ample treatments to fight TB, even as it continues to mutate.
But multidrug-resistant TB is a serious threat.
It is sometimes called “Ebola with wings”: while the two pathogens have similar death rates, MDR-TB is airborne and spreads more easily.
The current treatment for MDR-TB includes a regimen of toxic drugs – some requiring painful, daily injections – that can last for up to two years.
The treatment options for TB have scarcely evolved in decades.
Whereas the research and development pipelines for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C continue to deliver results, the R&D pipeline for TB lags far behind.
But that’s not the whole story.
In the last four years, TB care should have been revolutionized.
After 50 years without a single new TB drug being developed, two – bedaquiline and delamanid – were approved in quick succession.
This should have been an historic moment in the fight against TB, especially for drug-resistant patients.
One would have expected a broad coalition of health authorities, health-care providers, standard-setting bodies, insurers, and manufacturers to rush to the aid of the patients most in need of these new drugs.
But no such response emerged.
Instead, the new medicines have mostly gathered dust on warehouse shelves.
Since they were approved for use, a paltry 5% of patients in need have benefited from them.
The latest figures for delamanid, in particular, are appalling: after four years, a mere 1,247 patients worldwide have been treated with the drug.
We would know, because many of these patients were treated in our programs, and in countries where Médecins Sans Frontières and Partners in Health have been pushing for the registration and uptake of new medicines.
In partnership with Interactive Research and Development and with support from Unitaid – which channels funding from a painless airline tax toward addressing neglected health problems afflicting the poor – we launched the endTB initiative to accelerate use of the new drugs in 17 countries facing TB epidemics.
It is a sorry situation when nongovernmental organizations, rather than governments, academic institutions, and drug companies, must push for the use of available new drugs.
We took action because cash-strapped national TB programs tend to be conservative about adopting new treatments, and because pharmaceutical manufacturers have little incentive to bring their drugs to market in poorer countries.
The evidence we have gathered so far indicates that when the new drugs are used, hard-to-treat TB patients are likelier to recover, and often do so more quickly.
Given the scale of the global TB crisis, endTB’s work is a drop in the ocean.
Yet it offers a glimpse into the failing response at large: an appalling lack of political will, imagination, and urgency that leaves millions to die on our generation’s watch.
This September, the United Nations will host its first high-level meeting on the TB crisis.
UN member states should use the occasion to pledge a radical increase in funding for TB programs around the world, and to overhaul an R&D model that has proved unfit for purpose.
Otherwise, the event will be remembered as yet another meaningless gathering – one that left tens of millions to suffer in the clutches of the world’s deadliest infection.
Specifically, what we need are simpler, quicker, and cheaper ways to test and treat TB, especially in remote and impoverished settings.
We need better tools to prevent infections in the first place, and to kill latent infections before they kill us.
And, of course, we need a robust pipeline of drugs to ward off TB and its resistant forms.
In the meantime, the governments of TB-stricken countries must use the tools they already have – for example, by doing more to ensure that new treatments like bedaquiline and delamanid are made available to those who need them.
A UN meeting is a golden opportunity to make progress.
Although it will not solve the TB crisis overnight, it is a chance finally to elevate TB to the World Health Organization-designated status of a “public health emergency of international concern,” as was done in wake of the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.
The urgency of the TB crisis is well known to medical experts, and certainly to patients and their families.
Standard treatments are failing as we speak, and millions of people are silently being infected and falling ill.
In the twenty-first century, that should be a source of deep shame for us all.

Charlie and the Anti-Muslim Media Factory
PARIS – It is facile to frame the deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo as an attack on freedom of expression.
Are we supposed to be surprised that a global terror organization known for its brutal disregard for human rights and humane values would attack a media outlet that has specialized in provoking it?
Just as much of the social media in the Arab/Muslim world has made anti-Semitic rants routine, there is a global industry of outlets dedicated to all things anti-Muslim. In any given week, French, European, (and increasingly Indian) journalists, bloggers, tweeters, and others regularly express all sorts of things that are offensive or provocative to Muslims – or at least the most devout and fanatical among them.
There are literally hundreds of websites, radio programs, and TV networks that specialize in anti-Muslim and anti-Islam propaganda.
The Twitter hashtag #killallMoslems has been around since 2011.
While this abundance of offensiveness may comfort those concerned about freedom of expression, it does not give me any comfort as a European Muslim.
Europe’s suspicion of Islam is not new, of course, and one could say that the feeling is mutual.
But the level of anti-Muslim provocation has become unprecedented recently.
In Germany, the so-called Pegida movement now holds weekly anti-Muslim marches in several cities (though, in fairness, even bigger rallies, and almost all of Germany’s political elite, have opposed the Pegida marchers).
Last year, the mayor of Sargé-lès-le Mans, a French town of 3,500 people with 180 Muslim students, sought to impose pork meat on all schools.
A couple of years earlier, then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy joined in a campaign to ban halal meat branding, which became an election issue.
The Swiss, meanwhile, have banned minarets.
The list goes on.
Minorities are easy targets everywhere (certainly, Christians and Jews do not have an easy time nowadays in Muslim-majority countries).
And, given the fear campaign propagated by Al Qaeda and its affiliates, on the one hand, and right-wing racists, on the other, many people are unaware that Muslims are actually a very small minority in all European (and Western) countries.
That is why Charlie Hebdo’s mockery of the sacred beliefs of minorities (Jews, Muslims, and gays alike) is not an act of bravery.
Most people abstain from such provocations not because they are cowards, but because they believe, quite reasonably, that such behavior serves no good or useful purpose.
European Muslims are no less peaceful than their non-Muslim neighbors.
Almost all terrorist acts carried out by Muslims in Europe and other countries have been the work of affiliates of one umbrella organization – Al Qaeda.
Though this organization’s far-reaching influence is worrisome, it is also comforting to know how limited violent ideology is among Muslims, particularly in the West.
Indeed, there are no real homegrown Islamist terrorist organizations of any significance in Europe.
Radicalized European Muslims must look elsewhere.
To be sure, Muslim-majority countries are not known for their affection for free speech.
But, in the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, it is worth noting that, apart from war-torn Iraq and Syria, more journalists are killed each year in the largely Catholic Philippines than in any Muslim-majority country.
Unfortunately, as the horrific murder of 77 people by Anders Breivik in my adopted country of Norway has shown us, it only takes one organization or one individual to commit an atrocity, whatever a society’s level of education and living standards.
Yet, while lone wolves like Breivik are hard to detect, active members of terror organizations are much easier to detect and monitor.
This is where the attacks in Paris become more troublesome.
Here was a case of a catastrophic intelligence and security failure that allowed a group of four who were known to the police to be members of a globally active terrorist organization to operate with relative ease in the French capital.
Why were they on the loose?
Why were they not monitored and stopped earlier?
How many more such people, known to the police, are out there?
This is the discussion that is needed.
Focusing the debate solely on Islam and Muslims and the prospect of religious reform, integration, and co-existence is a way to camouflage failure.
Muslims are already very much part of every sphere of European life, including the security apparatus and the army.
European Muslims are integrated in their societies as professionals, athletes, academics, and civic leaders.
If we European Muslims are expected to identify with our citizenships and other secular identities, then our fellow Europeans should not categorize us by our religious identity.
No one should presume that European Muslims must apologize or explain the actions of a terrorist organization with a cult-like religious ideology, just as no one expected Norwegians to apologize for Breivik.
Al Qaeda and its affiliates have been known to attract disenchanted individuals from among Muslim and non-Muslim Europeans alike.
If we close our eyes, we can think that the Paris attacks exposed a contradiction between Islam and freedom of expression – and between Muslims and Europeans.
If we open them and start looking at cause and effect, we can avoid the abyss to which such willful blindness beckons us.
The Paris attacks targeted innocent people everywhere, and the public deserves answers from those whose job it is to prevent such incidents from happening.

How African Scholarship Can Reduce African Unemployment
BRIGHTON – With two thirds of Africa’s population under 25 years of age, the continent’s youth may be its biggest competitive advantage.
After all, countries’ long-term economic prospects are typically linked to the availability of a young, mobile labor force.
A recent report by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation concluded that ten of the world’s 25 fastest-growing economies between 2004 and 2014 were in Africa.
And yet, with many millions of young people unemployed in 2015, and many more underemployed, Africa has so far failed to reach its full potential.
The continent’s youth-employment challenge persists for many reasons.
For starters, youth-focused policies and interventions are limited across the region.
Programs that do exist lack adequate coordination, and often fail to incorporate lessons and feedback.
Employment strategies have also tended to be largely theory-based; while well meaning, they can fail to deliver results when put into practice.
But in our view, an additional, often overlooked weakness is an academic environment that limits contributions from Africa’s youngest scholars – students just finishing their PhDs – who may in fact hold the keys to putting the continent to work.
Experience shows that young African doctoral students produce research that is crucial to addressing the continent’s development challenges.
And yet, far too often, these young minds lack the training, access, and support they need to bring their ideas from the field to the policymaking arena.
That is why we have joined a global initiative to provide young African researchers an opportunity to engage in policy-oriented solutions, through research collaboration and publishing opportunities.
Launched in 2016 by The MasterCard Foundation and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in the United Kingdom, the Matasa Fellows Network aims to bring together the continent’s young academic talent to help solve Africa’s youth employment challenge.
Because that challenge is closely connected to other issues – like migration, conflict, rural development, and gender – policymakers must cast a wide net when considering solutions.
Our fellows’ research on these issues poses vital questions to governments and development funders about how to design solutions and implement them in ways that ensure accountability.
The first cohort of fellows, who recently published their findings in the IDS Bulletin, included ten African doctoral students working in the social sciences.
With coaching and mentorship from IDS staff, the fellows fine-tuned their ideas through peer mentorship and worked to generate policy ideas through interactions with government officials and NGOs professionals.
The fellows’ output so far has been remarkable: policy briefs on a diverse range of topics, including youth unemployment in Ghana, livestock production in Kenya, and regional strategies for improving youth-led entrepreneurship.
The inaugural Matasa fellows also studied the political dimensions of youth employment and policy processes in Ethiopia; the social and cultural concerns underpinning employment choices across the continent; how mentorship affects entrepreneurship; and how young Africans view illicit industries, like gambling and sex work.
Some of the fellows’ research has generated remarkable results –all the more so for being counterintuitive.
For example, Kampala-based researcher Nicholas Kilimani’s survey of employment strategies found that, contrary to commonly held assumptions, youth unemployment rates actually rise proportional to educational attainment.
Solving the employment crisis will therefore require creative thinking, Kilimani argues.
“The youth employment challenge requires policy action beyond basic education and labor markets,” he writes, “into areas such as credit markets, infrastructure, business regulation, and rural development.”
The work of Maurice Sikenyi, who studied Kenya’s Youth Enterprise Development Fund, a government-run microfinancing initiative, is equally innovative.
Using primary interviews and secondary data, the University of Minnesota scholar concluded that the fund’s reach and impact was being weakened by corruption, vague eligibility criteria, long wait times for loan processing, and an underappreciation of the risks young people take when starting their own business.
His paper explores how the development program could be strengthened through greater attention to accountability measures and a renewed focus on mentorship.
Africa can turn the corner on youth employment.
To do so, however, African decision-makers need to engage more deeply with the continent’s youngest, brightest researchers – who often are uniquely positioned to lend key insights – and build new nodes of academic connectivity between the continent’s research, policy, and practice.

Fat Chance
ATLANTA – We are, supposedly, in the midst of an obesity epidemic.
Everyone is getting fatter. Children are fatter than their parents.
Epidemics caused by fat are now manifest: Type 2 diabetes, increased rates of heart and cardiovascular disease, and notably more cancers, such as breast cancer.
This “globesity” epidemic is seen in poor countries as well as in wealthy ones.
But are people really so unhealthily fat?
Certainly there are morbidly obese people, whose weight puts their lives at risk.
Consider the British jailer Daniel Lambert (1770-1809), who stood 5’1” (155 centimeters) tall and weighed 739 lbs (335 kilos), yet neither drank nor ate “more than one dish at a meal.”
At his death, Lambert was remembered as a man of great “temperance.”
In other words, he was deemed to be healthy and happy.
The problem today seems to be that we have demonized “fat,” even among people who are labeled “overweight” rather that “obese.”
Indeed, we have lowered the boundary for “overweight” to include people considered “normal” a generation ago.
And we have deemed fat the major public health risk in our world and fat people the cause of a range of social problems, from placing stress on health-care systems to posing a risk to their own families.
Several causes of – some of them contradictory – obesity have been identified.
Some point to a shift in the “quality of life”: we live longer, have less physically stressful occupations, and have easier access to more food.
Moreover, we have abundant access to “bad” or “fast” cheap food and an absence of opportunities for physical activity in areas of extreme poverty: this is the “obesity of poverty” argument – that is, poverty is a contributory factor in morbid weight gain.
Others argue that our individual psychological makeup is at fault: we depend on food as a means of manipulating our environment.
On this assumption, obesity is simply on a continuum of eating disorders with anorexia nervosa, which has been defined as a mental illness.
But eating too much food is also an addiction, which nowadays is likewise usually understood in medical terms – as a genetic pathological predisposition in an individual or group.
Then again, obesity is sometimes viewed as a genetically predetermined “normal” predisposition, understood in terms of an evolutionary biological drive to accumulate body fat in order to prevent starvation in times of famine.
This is the “ob-gen” argument, first put forth in a 1994 paper by Yiying Zhang and her colleagues on the genetics of obesity in mice, which concluded by extrapolating their findings to human beings.
Being obese can also be caused by disruption of normal growth caused by pathological changes – ranging from tumors to aging (which is also understood as pathological) – in the endocrine system.
The older we become, the fatter we get, no matter what we eat – though this seems to conflict with the ob-gen argument that we need to get fat to avoid starvation.
On this view, an aging population means a fatter population in the United States, China, Japan, and much of Europe.
Finally, obesity can be the result of infection by an agent that makes us get fat.
Today, this agent is the adenovirus 36 (Ad–36), which stimulates the growth and reproduction of fat cells, as well as causing immature fat cells to mature more quickly, at least in chickens.
Of course, in a “real” human being any number of these causes – social, psychological, or genetic – may be at work.
But all define the obese as an object for intervention.
The model in public health is smoking, though the list of overlapping and contradictory causes implies greater deference to factors beyond our control.
As St. Augustine put it: “In the midst of these temptations I struggle daily against greed for food and drink. This is not an evil which I can decide once and for all to repudiate and never to embrace again, as I was able to do with fornication.”
So, are we getting too fat?
What does “too fat” mean in terms of individual happiness and health?
Why are we (if, indeed, we are) getting fatter?
If there is a public health question here, it may well be a series of problems rooted in a faulty assumption: the growth of girth and its absolute relationship to ill health.
This is not to say that there are no health problems associated with fat, but we have created a moral panic about the impact of increased weight on society, on the family, and on our happiness.
To see a world-wide epidemic of fat caused by a conspiracy of fast-food producers and our genes strikes one as weird: but the dieting culture relies on the sense that we must control this epidemic.
Each age, culture, and tradition defines what is an unacceptable body weight – unhealthy, ugly, or corrupt.
We must understand this as a process of creating ideal or normal bodies – those bodies that we desire to inhabit, but almost certainly will not.

An Arab Spring?
PARIS – Is Tunisia the first Arab authoritarian domino to fall?
Or is it a unique case that should not be viewed as a precedent for either the Arab world in general or the Maghreb in particular?
The region’s dictators have sought to dismiss the “Jasmine Revolution,” but the spark that started in Tunisia could spread – perhaps in a matter of months or years – to the entire Arab world.
Indeed, the wall of fear has crumbled, the people have spoken, and an “Arab spring” could be at hand.
The message from Tunisia, at least so far, is clear: corrupt and authoritarian regimes, beware: unless you reform deeply and quickly, your days are numbered.
The greatest danger is that the Jasmine Revolution could go the way of Romania’s anti-communist uprising of 20 years ago, with the old regime’s underlings expelling their bosses in order to stay in power.
But the best analogy for Tunisia today is Spain in the years preceding and following the death of Francisco Franco.
By opening itself to the world through tourism, and with its emphasis on education and women’s rights, Ben Ali’s regime created something unique in the Middle East: a vibrant middle class.
But the regime, like Franco’s dictatorship, did not treat the members of this new middle class like adults, thereby encouraging widespread frustration.
Given this, it would seem wrong, if not dangerous, to compare Tunisia and its Jasmine Revolution to other national contexts in the region.
Nevertheless, if Morocco looks stable today, this largely reflects two factors: monarchy and reform.
Led by a group of technocrats surrounding the young King Mohammed VI, a reform process – including political liberalization – has begun in earnest, even if the results still seem modest.
Moreover, Mohammed VI, as “Commander of the Believers,” benefits from a “Muslim” legitimacy that the leaders of Algeria and Egypt, two of the region’s most vulnerable regimes, do not possess.
And Morocco, contrary to Algeria, does not suffer from the curse of oil.
Even if the case of Tunisia is largely unique, it would be shortsighted to dismiss its potential influence elsewhere in the region, where many young Arabs in this age of Facebook and Twitter now “feel Tunisian.”
They, too, are humiliated by their leaders’ performance and, more deeply, their vulgar despotic essence.
They, too, thirst for freedom.
Whatever the Jasmine Revolution’s outcome, and even if it cannot become for the Arab world what the fall of the Berlin Wall was for Europe, it will establish a “before” and an “after.”
The “after” is likely to highlight two potential models of political development for the Arab world: Turkey and Iran.
If the revolutionary wave that began in Tunisia spreads to the rest of the Arab world, how many countries will be tempted by Turkish openness, and how many by Iranian fundamentalism?
Of course, that is a somewhat simplistic dichotomy.
There are grey areas in the Turkish experiment with “moderate Islam,” and, beyond Iran’s Mullahs, there are reasons for hope in the vibrant and resilient character of that country’s civil society.
What is clear is the West’s preference for the Turkish model.
Most Europeans may want to keep Turkey at a reasonable distance, but, confronted with changes and possible disorder, if not chaos, in the Arab world, they look favorably on Turkey’s potential to play a stabilizing role.
To be sure, history never repeats itself, but could some kind of neo-Ottoman order be the best answer to the risk of “Arab chaos”?
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey already plays a growing role in the region, and has strengthened its image with ordinary Arabs by taking a muscular diplomatic position against Israel’s deadly military assault in June 2010 on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that had been organized by a Turkish charity.
But it is one thing to be popular and another to serve as a model.
Turkey is demonstrating that Islam and modernity are compatible.
But the Turks are the Ottoman Empire’s heirs, and the Arab world, contrary to Western hopes, may not be ready to exchange its current frustration for the humiliating admission that it requires its former rulers’ model to progress toward modernity.
It would be dangerous to assume that after Tunisia, democracy in the Arab world is just around the corner.
But the belief that nothing will change is equally illusory.
For better or worse, history is on the move in the Arab world – and there is very little the West can do about it.

Ban Heavy Fuel Oil in the Arctic
LONDON – Thirty-five years ago, as part of a global expedition, Charles Burton and I traveled across the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole, camping for three months on a fast-moving ice floe.
It was, for us, a journey that defined our lives, and formed one leg of an enduring world record.
But another record, this one far less stable, belongs to the Arctic ice itself: by March of this year, it had shrunk to the smallest size ever recorded.
The disappearance of polar ice is driven by the use of fossil fuels, which not only underpins global warming, but also has a more immediate effect, owing to widespread reliance on heavy fuel oil (HFO) to power ships.
HFO is cheap and abundant, but it is also toxic and dirty.
When ships navigate the Arctic, pollutants like sulphur oxide and black carbon are deposited onto the ice and snow.
The pollutant accumulation accelerates snowmelt, which warms ocean waters and, in turn, creates a self-reinforcing cycle of more melting.
The world has an opportunity to reverse these trends this week, when the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) meets in London.
At that meeting, Canada, along with a number of Arctic and non-Arctic member states, will propose a strategy for limiting the use and transport of HFO by ships in the Arctic.
It is imperative that every state in attendance supports this crucial measure to protect the fragile and fast-vanishing Arctic ecosystem.
HFO has been the “king of marine fuels” since the 1960s, but only in recent years has it come under increased scrutiny.
In August 2011, it was banned from ships entering Antarctic waters, but Arctic states have been slower to move.
In 2015, HFO accounted for nearly 60% of the marine fuel consumed by ships operating in the Arctic.
Economic considerations drive HFO’s popularity, but it is now widely understood that its environmental and human costs outweigh the benefits.
When HFO is spilled in icy waters, it breaks down slowly and can devastate ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on them.
HFO is also a significant source of air pollution.
The climate warming effects of black carbon, for example, are up to five times worse in the Arctic than they are at lower latitudes.
Alternative shipping fuels exist.
Marine diesel oil and liquefied natural gas, for example, are cost effective and cleaner than HFO.
What’s needed is the political will to enforce a transition to less-polluting options.
For now, only limited HFO bans have been enacted, such as those enforced in the Southern Ocean and the waters around the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.
As Arctic ice recedes, new shipping lanes will open to larger vessels, bearing the flags of a larger number of states, making HFO regulations even more important.
The Arctic Council has warned that more shipping traffic will increase the risk of catastrophic oil spills.
Some countries are already taking action.
In 2016, the United States and Canada announced a “phase down” in the use of HFO in vessels operating in the Arctic.
Many other countries quietly support this work.
But passive support is not enough.
Now that the IMO meeting is taking place, more countries must step forward and add their voice to the growing number of states calling for an HFO ban in the Arctic.
The European Parliament, for its part, has already broadly supported such a move.
Momentum toward an HFO phase-out in the Arctic is building.
The Danish Shipowners’ Association and the Arctic expedition cruise operator Hurtigruten are just two of the players calling for tighter regulations or an outright ban.
Other shipping companies have highlighted the need for regulations to maintain a level playing field.
In January 2017, Hurtigruten joined the Clean Arctic Alliance to launch the Arctic Commitment. The initiative brings together shipping operators, polar explorers, NGOs, communities, and businesses to back an HFO phase-out, ahead of any increase in Arctic shipping, while urging the broader shipping industry to switch to alternative fuels.
(I signed earlier this year.)
At this month’s Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting, IMO member states must build on the progress already made by supporting the HFO phase-out proposed by Canada.
In particular, they must commit to enforcement of any resulting IMO measures, and to ensuring that the use of HFO is eventually banned from Arctic waters.
We have time to append the record books on Arctic ice, but we must act fast.

Donald Trump Versus Mideast Peace
JERUSALEM – In a matter of three weeks, the United States government has attacked the Palestinian people on three fronts.
First, on November 17, President Donald Trump’s administration announced its decision (subsequently reversed) to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s diplomatic office in Washington, DC.
Then, on December 5, the US Congress voted unanimously to adopt the Taylor Force Act, which blocks aid to the Palestinian Authority from 2018 to 2024, unless the PA stops paying monthly salaries and other benefits to the families of killed or convicted Palestinian militants.
But it was the third attack, which came the following day, that will prove most devastating to efforts to achieve peace.
In defiance of overwhelming global opposition, not to mention past United Nations General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, Trump announced that the US will officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The message is clear: the Trump administration is determined to dictate the Israeli version of peace with the Palestinians, rather than to mediate an equitable agreement between the two sides.
Of course, that is not how Trump’s administration presents it.
As the New York Times reported just before the announcement, Trump administration officials believe the decision, which entails moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, could actually hasten the peace process, “by removing a source of ambiguity from the American position.” After all, they point out, the embassy question comes up every six months, when the president has to sign a new waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv – a process that, from their perspective, repeatedly stokes political tension.
In his address on the topic, Trump reiterated this argument.
Officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, he asserted, “is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement.” He also claimed that the decision “is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement,” one “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”
But, in that same speech, Trump betrayed the superiority he ascribes to Israel: “Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital.”
Despite its best efforts, Palestine, of course, is not recognized as a sovereign state by the US.
So, far from seeking a fair peace deal between the two parties, Trump has effectively declared victory for Israel – and instructed the Palestinians to accept defeat quietly.
Yet the Palestinians have displayed a profound capacity for resistance.
Just last summer, when the Israeli government decided unilaterally to install metal detectors at the entrances of Al Haram Al Sharif/Al Aqsa Mosque, Palestinians demonstrated outside the mosque for two weeks, forcing the Israelis to reverse the decision.
Moving the US embassy to Jerusalem is a far more powerful symbolic move, suggesting that it could spur even more formidable resistance – and not just from the 300,000 Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem, or even from the more than 12 million Palestinians around the world.
What Trump’s administration fails to recognize is that Jerusalem – the third-holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina – isn’t just an Israeli-Palestinian issue; all of the world’s 350 million Arabs and 1.5 billion Muslims have a direct and vital stake in it.
Trump may think that his current honeymoon with Saudi Arabia will allow him to escape pushback from Arab leaders.
But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is facing too much opposition to his own reforms to side openly with Israel on so emotive an issue as Jerusalem.
The fact is that leaders across the Muslim and Arab world are not going to allow Trump to hand Jerusalem to Israel unilaterally, simply to satisfy his small base of US Christian Zionist evangelicals (he received the support of less than a quarter of American Jews).
And, indeed, Mohammad Shtayyeh, a member of the Fatah central committee, has already pledged that the Palestinian leadership, in coordination with Jordan and other Arab states, will resist the dictate.
Yet it is not just Arabs or Muslims who support the Palestinians’ just demands for a fair peace agreement. Innumerable people worldwide – of all faiths and backgrounds, as well as resolutions by the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, and the International Court of Justice – also support this stance.
This is true even in the US: according to a poll released by the Arab American Institute, only 20% of Americans (including American Arabs and American Jews) favor moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The Palestinians are calling for a two-state solution, with East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state and West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The Israelis, by contrast, have consistently thwarted a two-state solution, and demanded to have Jerusalem all to themselves.
In short, it is the Israeli government’s position – and that of the Trump administration – that must change, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is ever to be resolved.
Many in Israel recognize this: 25 prominent Israelis, including former diplomats, army generals, and academics, signed a letter to Trump’s Mideast peace envoy denouncing the Jerusalem decision. “The status of Jerusalem,” they wrote, “lies at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and must be determined within the context of resolving that conflict.”
Any viable peace deal must be able to stand the test of time.
And that means it must be fair and just, rather than leaving one party seething with resentment – especially if that resentment extends to millions of people worldwide.
Attempting to ram a solution down Palestinians’ throats will increase the likelihood of even more violence, not peace.

The ECB’s New Stealth Mandate
STANFORD – The European Central Bank’s monetary policy has undergone a peculiar change during the pandemic.
Something other than the goal of price stability appears to be guiding the bank’s overall approach, suggesting that it has adopted a new mandate without publicly announcing it.
Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, the ECB has succeeded in closing the gap between northern and southern member states’ borrowing costs, bringing eurozone North-South yield spreads to historic lows.
And with Europe facing multiple threats to its unity – from Donald Trump’s administration and Vladimir Putin’s revanchist Kremlin to an increasingly assertive China and homegrown populists – policymakers have effectively adopted “spread narrowing” as a new mandate.
ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues seem to recognize that ensuring European unity and solidarity is the most important objective an institution like the ECB can pursue at this critical moment.
Though no one at the bank is likely to admit it, there is little question that they are now in the business of holding down spreads.
By purchasing massive quantities of periphery member-state bonds through its quantitative-easing policy and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), the ECB has driven up the demand for riskier bonds in the market.
As a result, yields on ten-year sovereign bonds issued by Portugal and Spain have dropped below zero, and Italy’s bond yields have fallen to a decade low.
Lagarde’s leadership team has had much more success closing the North-South interest-rate spread than it has in meeting the ECB’s price-stability mandate of “below, but close to 2%” annual inflation.
Perhaps this reflects the ECB Governing Council’s recognition that the inflation target is unattainable without more fiscal stimulus.
Of course, even if the ECB has adopted a “what’s the use?” attitude with respect to the inflation target, that does not explain its persistent refusal to cut the discount rate even in the face of one of the biggest shocks to economic activity in living memory.
At the Governing Council’s most recent meeting, it refused to cut the discount rate from -0.5%, thereby creating the effect of a counterproductive rate increase.
On balance, this approach has catapulted the euro to its highest levels since 2018, and caused eurozone inflation to plunge even further from the ECB’s target in what is now the fourth consecutive month of falling prices.
The unstated reason for this strategy is plain as day: The ECB is focused on improving conditions for banks in the eurozone’s periphery countries and believes that cutting the discount rate would compound these banks’ problems.
Despite significant improvements in their financial health, banks in periphery countries remain very concerned about the fallout of the current crisis.
But this problem should sort itself out as southern economies recover.
For the time being, then, the prudent response to the ECB’s neglect of its inflation mandate is, “Who cares?” Narrowing North-South yield spreads is far more important for Europe’s survival and future prosperity than are a few ticks on a price index.
After all, just look at the results.
The new mandate that dare not speak its name has prevented the euro from unraveling as a result of the pandemic – a possibility that many feared early on.
It has put the eurozone on a rock-solid footing, deepening European financial integration and solidarity (which has made the weakest members’ bonds increasingly attractive to international investors) just in time for the second wave of infections.
Spread-narrowing policies were perhaps the most important actions taken at the Governing Council’s meeting last week, when it launched a fresh round of stimulus, promising to buy €500 billion ($608 billion) more in bonds by expanding the PEPP from €1.35 trillion to €1.85 trillion.
At the same time that it shifts focus from its inflation target, the ECB is acting with steady purpose when it comes to spread stability.
Lagarde’s own role in the ECB’s new direction has been somewhat ambiguous.
In March, she remarked at an ECB press conference that it was not the bank’s job to narrow the gap in borrowing costs between stronger and weaker eurozone economies.
But that comment triggered a selloff in the bond markets, forcing ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane to get on the phone with leading financial institutions to ensure that there was no misunderstanding about ECB policy.
For her part, Lagarde’s position now is very different from the one she expressed earlier in the year.
In fact, she sounds much less like her March self, and more like French President Emmanuel Macron, for whom support of the periphery countries and North-South integration has always been a matter of primary concern.
Whatever her initial position, Lagarde recovered quickly and has become the leader the ECB needs.
Macron’s fingerprints may or may not be all over the new de facto spread-narrowing strategy, but myopic technocrats no longer have exclusive control over ECB policymaking.
Politicians with a deep understanding of what Europe needs are having a tangible influence, and the overall results are more than satisfactory.

A Year to Act
OXFORD – Let us hope that 2019 is the year when the historical tide turns.
In 2018, divisions within and between countries continued to deepen.
And while geopolitical tensions and political tribalism have transformed international relations and national politics, new technologies are upending long-held assumptions about security, politics, and economics.
Complicating matters further is the growing interdependence of our societies.
We are all increasingly subject to forces beyond the control of any one country, city, or individual, not least when it comes to climate change.
What a difference three decades makes.
Back in 1989, the collapse of the Soviet bloc seemed to augur a triumph for liberal democratic principles and values.
The development of the World Wide Web that year promised a new age of human flourishing and global cooperation.
As recently as the 2000s, flashy catchphrases like “the death of distance” and “the world is flat” abounded.
Yet far from flattening the world, globalization has made it more mountainous and uneven.
More than ever, one’s postal code determines one’s perspective, lifespan, and fate.
Instead of replacing national ideals with shared values, globalization has led to rapacious competition, the decline of welfare states, and the corrosion of international institutions.
And though there technically are more democracies today than in 1989, many are becoming more illiberal.
Not surprisingly, public support for globalization has waned.
The attacks of September 11, 2001, and the $5.6 trillion “war on terror” certainly didn’t help.
Nor did the 2008 financial crisis, which exposed the failure of experts and institutions to manage interdependence and technological change.
A growing divide between elites and all those who have been “left behind” has poisoned politics for a generation.
Still, the disillusionment with globalization is mostly confined to North American and Western European countries.
After all, the fortunes of the emerging powers in East and Southeast Asia have risen, and most people around the world are objectively better off in the aggregate than they were 30 years ago.
Outside of the West, average incomes since the fall of the Berlin Wall have doubled – and tripled in China.
Life expectancy in many developing countries has increased by a whopping 15 years, and three billion more people worldwide have learned to read and write.
But there is no guarantee that this “New Enlightenment,” as Steven Pinker of Harvard University calls it, will continue delivering progress.
The Enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries came in the wake of the Renaissance, which was a period not only of scientific and artistic revolution, but also of rising intolerance, religious warfare, and persecution of scientists and intellectuals.
The reactionary violence during and after the Renaissance owed much to elites’ failure to manage the rapid change and rising inequalities occasioned by the print revolution.
Today’s elites should take note.
The spectacular fallout from the US-led invasion of Iraq and the 2008 financial crisis profoundly damaged public trust in authorities and experts.
What unites right- and left-wing populism is the idea that the old guard has let the people down while ensconcing itself in a cocoon of privilege.
They have a point.
Flawed policies to promote globalization have let us down and contributed to growing inequality.
And now, artificial intelligence and automation are threatening to replace routine jobs and accentuate social divisions.
Can political leaders and citizens muster the will to tackle common threats, or are we headed for further fragmentation?
Much will depend on the steps taken in 2019.
Now more than ever, we must grapple with the accelerating and interdependent drivers of change.
To that end, policymakers must take steps to protect the most vulnerable.
Social safety nets are being slashed precisely when people need them most.
After the financial crisis depleted government resources and produced crippling debts, governments such as that of the US have made matters worse by cutting taxes.
More broadly, we all need to roll up our sleeves and get a handle on globalization.
That means abandoning the outdated twentieth-century paradigm that divides all politics into left and right, socialism and capitalism.
The politics of 2019 is values-based, which is why traditional political parties are being outflanked by parties appealing to national sentiment and nostalgic fantasies.
Today’s political revolution has so far been defined by anger and frustration.
But those sentiments can and should be harnessed to serve the goal of constructive change.
To achieve an inclusive globalization, we must address rising inequality, embrace diversity, and rescue international cooperation from the specter of unilateralism.
The stakes could not be higher than they are in 2019.
When extremism, algorithms, fake news, and foreign manipulation drive politics, democracy itself is threatened.
Without more active engagement on the part of policymakers and political leaders, there can be little hope for the future.
The accelerating pace of change, along with deepening international interdependence, makes it harder, not easier, to find common solutions.
It is tempting to try to stop the clock and retreat from hard choices.
But the changes underway will affect us all, regardless of whether we participate in the conversation.
The only way forward, then, is to improve our literacy and engage with complex ideas.
To do otherwise and play the victim is to invite catastrophe.
Only by shaping the future ourselves will we fear it less.
Unless bold people act, the arc of history will not bend toward justice or improved outcomes.
Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we are again at a crossroads, and a battle of ideas is raging. The new walls being built within and between societies pose a grave threat to our collective future.
This is the year to start knocking them down.

The Dutch Jobs Miracle
PARIS: Unemployment in the Netherlands dipped below 3% recently, a figure for the most part unheard of in Europe since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
Indeed, not so long ago unemployment in the Netherlands stood above 10%.
Have the Dutch invented a Fourth Way to improved economic performance and are there lessons for the rest of Europe in the Dutch experience?
For some observers across Europe, the economic performance of the Netherlands is so surprising that they believe it a product of smoke and mirrors, or of some statistical trick.
But as with those who doubted the reality behind American economic growth five years ago, this view is also emphatically wrong.
Not only is unemployment way down in the Netherlands, but the rate of participation by the entire population in the labour market is growing sharply as well.
True, the proportion of workers who remain classified by the state as sick or invalid – currently 12% – remains much too high, to be frank.
But this proportion is less today than it was in the 1980s; so a higher unemployment rate is not being disguised by medical certificates.
Other disbelieving observers say that what we are seeing in the Netherlands is the effect of a shortening of the work week.
The average work week in the Netherlands (counting both those who work full-time and those who work part-time) is 27 hours, compared to 29 hours in France.
Advocates of a shorter work week as the road to full employment, indeed, often cite the Dutch example to declare victory for their arguments.
Those against a shortened work week, however, dismiss the increase in the number of jobs that results from shorter working hours as a false solution – a crude swap of working hours for an increase in the number of workers.
Both hostile camps are wrong.
There is a significant increase in part-time work in the Netherlands, to be sure, but it is due, primarily, to a large increase in labor participation among women.
Thus part-time work does not mechanically explain the country’s lower unemployment rate.
So what is the secret of successful job creation in the Netherlands?
The immediate reason is easy to identify.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, wage increases have been smaller than technological progress would have allowed.
Company profits have thus gone up, leading to new investment and the creation of new jobs.
This is a classic mechanism, but one which has worked perfectly.
The more delicate question is to identify those factors that made wage moderation in the Netherlands possible.
I see two principal reasons:
• The first is a reform of unemployment insurance. The Netherlands has put into effect a reform that links unemployment compensation to searching for a new job.
Refusal by an unemployed person to take an “acceptable” job offer automatically results in the end of state support for him or her.
The longer an individual remains unemployed, the wider the definition of what constitutes an “acceptable” becomes.
In practice what this means is that an unemployed person must accept a “comparable” job for the first six months of unemployment, and must take any job on offer after eighteen months on the dole or lose state benefits.
• The second factor is cooperation among social partners.
The Dutch harp on this point, but they are right.
For at the root of the Dutch miracle lies the by now quasi-mythological Wassenaar Agreement, signed in 1982, among employers, unions, and the government.
At the time, it was clear to all concerned that the Dutch economy was in bad shape.
The Wassenaar Agreement was a plan of action: moderation of wage demands was assured in exchange for measures designed to alleviate the human cost of unemployment, from the financing of early retirement to the shortening of the work week.
By and large, this strategy has been adhered to ever since.
Important lessons are to be found in the Dutch experience for all of Europe.
Today, economic conditions in Western Europe are good – in some places, better than that even – and they are improving in many countries of Eastern Europe that are seeking EU membership.
But Europe’s economies are regularly subject to new recessions.
These recessions will require painful adjustments.
Without a mechanism for social cooperation, the adjustments that any recession will impose are likely to result in high unemployment.
With a solid mechanism of social cooperation, however, there is at least a chance to avoid it.
It is now, when economies are doing better, that such a structure for social cooperation must be considered and constructed.

Resilient Brazil
SÃO PAULO – Less than a decade ago, Brazil’s economy faltered at the first sign of instability in international financial markets.
Today, by contrast, the country seems immune from global market turbulence – or so Brazilian officials believe.
“We are growing free of imbalances and, in fact, gradually reducing our dependence on inflows of foreign exchange – that’s key.” Indeed, the government has emphasized that Brazil will be even more insulated as efforts to cut spending reduce dependence on external capital flows.
But Brazil’s ability to escape the effects of a recession in the United States depends on the scale of the crisis.
Brazilian officials do have some reasons to boast that Latin America’s largest economy may be stronger than ever: macroeconomic indicators are healthier, solvency ratios have improved, and a mix of exports, investment, and domestic demand has been stimulating economic activity.
During the recent years of abundant global liquidity, the real grew stronger and the central bank was able to pile up foreign reserves, creating a cushion that totaled roughly $185 billion in late January, an amount sufficient to cover the entire foreign debt for the first time in history.
With foreign direct investment still flowing in, Brazil’s lower external vulnerability leaves the country in a much better position than ever before to weather the global storm – at least for now.
Nevertheless, government officials admit, off the record, that the impact of an expected US recession will not be insignificant, because Brazil is not fully protected from external events.
Beyond the sub-prime crisis, concerns about the US financial system’s stability carry serious implications for the global economy.
Moreover, a recession or a slowdown in the US and Europe would hit Brazilian exports, narrowing Brazil’s trade surplus considerably. In fact, although America’s trade significance has diminished, accounting for only 16% of Brazilian exports last year, Brazilian trade and growth typically go hand in hand with the US and Europe; historically they have never decoupled.
At the same time, an extended US slowdown could reduce foreign demand from other markets.
The scenario could worsen if there is a breakdown in commodity prices – one of the most serious threats to Brazil from a global economic slump. Deceleration in India and China would lead to further cuts in prices for raw materials, weakening markets whose strength has underpinned Brazil’s powerful trade performance in recent years.
In any case, the central bank has already projected that Brazil’s trade surplus will disappear this year, with a small deficit expected.
Fortunately, Brazil’s stock exchange has suffered less than other emerging-market bourses from the financial turbulence in the US and elsewhere.
Recently, the exchange has become the prime source of financing for Brazilian companies, ahead of the state-owned National Development Bank, which grants loans at below-market rates.
But Brazil’s financial markets are much more sensitive than trade to international disturbances, and monetary flows could decrease in the long term.
Indeed, should the global economy deteriorate further, outward portfolio investment could accelerate, reducing the financing available to Brazilian corporations and eventually affecting their ability to invest.
So far, business confidence is still high in the industrial sector, according to internal surveys conducted by the São Paulo Association of Industries, and inward FDI hit a record-high US$34.6bn last year.
Optimistically, Brazilian officials believe that the government’s Growth Acceleration Program will serve as a vaccine against global turbulence and help reduce bottlenecks in the economy.
The positive growth outlook, following an estimated 5.1% GDP gain in 2007, is presented as a reliable defense against external contagion.
Nevertheless, the devil is in the details.
Global turmoil could derail Brazil’s expansion.
New obstacles for the Brazilian economy could lead to softening domestic growth and the internalization of inflation, bringing the crisis home.
Consequently, although the current crisis is expected to have a relatively minor effect compared to past upheavals, the possibility of contagion from turbulence in the US cannot be disregarded.
It is therefore essential that Brazil’s private and public sectors do their utmost to sustain long-term growth by making the economic environment more business-friendly.
Beyond that, one can only hope that current external economic disturbances do not lead to a global disaster.

How to End the Pandemic This Year
LONDON – Research to develop a safe, effective, and widely available COVID-19 vaccine is advancing rapidly.
But when it will happen is not clear.
Much depends on how we govern the production and distribution of new drugs.
While the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool promises to foster accessibility, the actual availability of vaccines and treatments also will hinge on local manufacturing capacity, which in many countries has been eroded by deindustrialization.
Moreover, while universal testing remains a feasible, cost-effective, and immediately available method of managing the pandemic until a vaccine arrives, this approach also requires manufacturing capacity and sound governance in the public interest.
Yet even in advanced economies, over-reliance on the private sector may prevent governments from maximizing test production and deployment.
For example, the British government has proposed a “moon shot” testing program, yet its actual strategy needs clarification.
Such a mission-oriented approach requires a holistic, systems-level perspective, particularly when it comes to “wicked problems” like public-health crises and climate change, which involve a wide range of complex socioeconomic and technological issues.
Implementing universal testing will require contributions from a sprawling network of actors and institutions.
To be truly effective, any such program must be designed to generate systemic resilience and public value.
As has been demonstrated by the Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer, the epidemiologist Michael Mina, a recent IMF working paper, and many others, a properly designed universal testing program could bring the pandemic to an end within just a few months.
The missing ingredients are industrial policies and other government measures to coordinate and steer production, in order to eliminate the bottlenecks that the private sector faces.
The necessary testing technology of rapid immunodiagnostic tests – such as saliva-based antigen tests that are similar to home pregnancy tests and cost less than $5 – already exists.
Although these tests are sub-optimal in sensitivity compared with the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, they are specific enough to detect infections at scale in settings disease prevalence is high; and, crucially, they do not require centralized laboratory facilities.
Therefore, with a purposeful program design that carefully considers the functionality and limitations of the technology deployed, rapid tests can enable decentralized universal testing programs at the community level.
For example, tests could be made available free of charge at local pharmacies, with the expectation that everyone test themselves on a regular basis and self-isolate if positive.
The same kits could be used as “infection-free” passports for admission to public spaces such as schools and workplaces.
In this case, a new market would likely emerge as airlines, malls, restaurants, and cafés start purchasing cheap, rapid tests so that they can get back to business.
Rapid testing can help to expand and complement the universal testing strategy already being rolled out locally (such as the free mandatory testing at MIT and Georgetown University in the United States, weekly testing of employees at German workplaces, and the population-wide testing campaign in Wuhan).
Similar strategies need to be launched at the national level, especially in low- and middle-income countries where the affordability and scalability of molecular testing is low.
Many countries have the capacity to produce a sufficient supply of tests at a cost that would pale in comparison to those inflicted by the pandemic.
The number of tests needed globally over a year to supply a weekly testing regimen would be equivalent to less than half the number of cans of soda consumed annually.
Moreover, scaling up production of antigen tests could be done relatively quickly, and would be a minor effort compared to the US mobilization for World War II.
While billions of dollars are being funneled toward vaccine development and production, additional funding also must be directed toward strengthening our testing infrastructure.
At $5 per unit, the cost of testing the world’s population every week would come to around $2 trillion.
That is far less than the pandemic-related loss of global income during this period (as measured by the difference between pre- and post-pandemic growth forecasts) and fiscal stimulus so far this year, an estimated total of $20 trillion.
And these comparisons don’t account for the costs of lost lives or the potential benefits of achieving new economies of scale in test production – a spillover that could enable the eradication of the seasonal flu.
There are potentially steep challenges beyond production, of course.
As practical as universal testing is, any such effort could still come under pressure if governments believe they must choose between different production needs for vaccines, anti-viral drugs, personal protective equipment, and expanded medical facilities.
But universal testing must not be viewed as a separate item on a larger list of priorities.
The point of a mission-oriented approach is to create dynamic public-sector capabilities and strengthen the entire health system at once.
New testing capacity should be integrated with national and local health systems as part of a broader program design, so that each leg of the strategy supports the others.
More broadly, COVID-19 has underscored the need for a more resilient and responsive industrial ecosystem that can increase production of essential items quickly.
Even under current conditions, increasing the production of tests and implementing a universal testing strategy is feasible, and could end the pandemic by year’s end, while also creating the infrastructure needed to ward off future pandemics.
All countries need to adopt a longer-term vision and shore up their manufacturing capabilities.
By leading on this issue, governments can strengthen local productive capacities and create a new kind of economic commons.
The same mission-oriented approach could then be applied to science policy and industrial strategy, laying the groundwork for more cross-sectoral innovations and the type of resilient manufacturing that will be needed to tackle other highly complex global challenges.
The days when we could pin all our hopes on technological fixes are over.

America’s Deepening Moral Crisis
NEW YORK – America’s political and economic crisis is set to worsen following the upcoming November elections.
President Barack Obama will lose any hope for passing progressive legislation aimed at helping the poor or the environment.
Indeed, all major legislation and reforms are likely to be stalemated until 2013, following a new presidential election.
An already bad situation marked by deadlock and vitriol is likely to worsen, and the world should not expect much leadership from a bitterly divided United States.
Much of America is in a nasty mood, and the language of compassion has more or less been abandoned.
Both political parties serve their rich campaign contributors, while proclaiming that they defend the middle class.
Neither party even mentions the poor, who now officially make up 15% of the population but in fact are even more numerous, when we count all those households struggling with health care, housing, jobs, and other needs.
The Republican Party recently issued a “Pledge to America” to explain its beliefs and campaign promises.
The document is filled with nonsense, such as the fatuous claim that high taxes and over-regulation explain America’s high unemployment.
It is also filled with propaganda.
A quotation by President John F. Kennedy states that high tax rates can strangle the economy, but Kennedy’s was speaking a half-century ago, when the top marginal tax rates were twice what they are today.
Most of all, the Republican platform is devoid of compassion.
America today presents the paradox of a rich country falling apart because of the collapse of its core values.
American productivity is among the highest in the world.
Average national income per person is about $46,000 – enough not only to live on, but to prosper.
Yet the country is in the throes of an ugly moral crisis.
Income inequality is at historic highs, but the rich claim that they have no responsibility to the rest of society.
They refuse to come to the aid of the destitute, and defend tax cuts at every opportunity.
Almost everybody complains, almost everybody aggressively defends their own narrow and short-term interests, and almost everybody abandons any pretense of looking ahead or addressing the needs of others.
What passes for American political debate is a contest between the parties to give bigger promises to the middle class, mainly in the form of budget-busting tax cuts at a time when the fiscal deficit is already more than 10% of GDP.
Americans seem to believe that they have a natural right to government services without paying taxes.
In the American political lexicon, taxes are defined as a denial of liberty.
There was a time, not long ago, when Americans talked of ending poverty at home and abroad.
Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty in the mid-1960’s reflected an era of national optimism and the belief that society should make collective efforts to solve common problems, such as poverty, pollution, and health care.
America in the 1960’s enacted programs to rebuild poor communities, to fight air and water pollution, and to ensure health care for the elderly.
Then the deep divisions over Vietnam and civil rights, combined with a surge of consumerism and advertising, seemed to end an era of shared sacrifice for the common good.
For 40 years, compassion in politics receded.
Ronald Reagan gained popularity by cutting social benefits for the poor (claiming that the poor cheated to receive extra payments).
Bill Clinton continued those cuts in the 1990’s.
Today, no politician even dares to mention help for poor people.
The big campaign contributors to both parties pay to ensure that their vested interests dominate political debates.
That means that both parties increasingly defend the interests of the rich, though Republicans do so slightly more than Democrats.
Even a modest tax increase on the rich is unlikely to find support in American politics.
The result of all of this is likely to be a long-term decline of US power and prosperity, because Americans no longer invest collectively in their common future.
America will remain a rich society for a long time to come, but one that is increasingly divided and unstable.
Fear and propaganda may lead to more US-led international wars, as in the past decade.
And what is happening in America is likely to be repeated elsewhere.
America is vulnerable to social breakdown because it is a highly diverse society.
Racism and anti-immigrant sentiments are an important part of the attack on the poor, or at least the reason why so many are willing to heed the propaganda against helping the poor.
As other societies grapple with their own increasing diversity, they may follow the US into crisis.
Swedes recently gave enough votes to a right-wing, anti-immigrant party to give it representation in parliament, reflecting a growing backlash against the rising number of immigrants in Swedish society.
In France, Nicolas Sarkozy’s government has tried to regain popularity with the working class by deporting Roma migrants, a target of widespread hatred and ethnic attacks.
Both examples show that Europe, like the US, is vulnerable to the politics of division, as our societies become more ethnically diverse.
The lesson from America is that economic growth is no guarantee of wellbeing or political stability.
American society has become increasingly harsh, where the richest Americans buy their way to political power, and the poor are abandoned to their fate.
In their private lives, Americans have become addicted to consumerism, which drains their time, savings, attention, and inclination to engage in acts of collective compassion.
The world should beware.
Unless we break the ugly trends of big money in politics and rampant consumerism, we risk winning economic productivity at the price of our humanity.

Harnessing the Remittance Boom
ROME – For more than a decade, Asia’s economies have been on the move – and so have its people.
The scale of migration from rural to urban areas and across international borders is historically unprecedented, and twenty-first-century Asia is its focal point.
In Asia’s developing countries, the power and potential of remittances – the money that migrant workers send home to their families (many of whom live in poor and remote areas) – is immense.
Currently, over 60 million migrant workers from the Asia/Pacific region account for more than half of all remittance flows to developing countries, sending home about $260 billion in 2012.
China, India, and the Philippines are the three largest recipients of remittances, while Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam are also in the top ten.
The money is often a lifeline: it is estimated that 10% of Asian families depend on payments from abroad to obtain their food, clothing, and shelter.
But, while remittances to developing countries are five times higher than official development assistance, the enormous potential returns for society have not been realized – and can be secured only if the flow of money can be channeled into effective rural and agricultural development, particularly in fragile states and post-conflict countries.
Doing so would contribute significantly to creating jobs, enhancing food security, and fostering stability in countries emerging from strife.
In order to establish such channels, we must scale up key initiatives, identify new opportunities, and map out the road ahead.
The fourth Global Forum on Remittances, which runs May 20-23 in Bangkok, will do just that.
Convened by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Bank, the forum will bring together policymakers, private-sector players, and civil-society leaders to chart a course for leveraging the development impact of remittances sent home each year in Asia and around the world.
At IFAD, our starting point is always the three billion people who live in the rural areas of developing countries.
We work to create conditions in which poor rural women and men can grow and sell more food, increase their incomes, and determine the direction of their own lives.
We believe that diasporas and the global donor community can leverage the flow of migrant investment if they form partnerships with national governments for long-term development of the rural communities that are so often the beginning of the migration chain.
More than 215 million people around the world live outside of the countries they call home.
But most families that rely on remittances operate outside of the world’s financial system as well.
Despite the global prevalence of electronic money transfers, most migrant workers are excluded from the convenience of modern banking services, dependent on costly cash transfers that often require rural recipients to travel significant distances.
As a result, migrant workers are forced to initiate more than one billion separate transactions worldwide each year.
That means more than one billion trips for rural women and men to collect their money.
Adding up the cost of the transfer, travel, and time, remittances are far too expensive for people living in poverty.
IFAD has been working in more than 40 countries to ensure that rural families can have easy access to remittances, and are better able to use them as savings or investments that go back into their communities.
The amount of money at stake is staggering: It is estimated that over the next five years, more than $2.5 trillion will be sent in remittances to developing countries, with almost 40% – coming in the form of payments of $50, $100, or $500 at a time – destined for rural areas.
While the majority of family remittances will always be used to meet immediate needs, IFAD’s experience shows that rural families would seize opportunities to save and invest, even small amounts, if they had better options.
While remittances should and can be leveraged to bring about impressive results in poverty reduction, let us not forget that there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.
Young people, the leaders and farmers of tomorrow, are leaving their rural communities behind in search of better opportunities.
We need to turn rural areas into vibrant and economically stable communities that provide opportunities for young people to earn a living, build their capacities, and start a family.
We should not ignore the enormous development potential of remittances to rural areas.
Let us empower families to use their hard-earned money in ways that will help to make migration a matter of choice, not a necessity for the generations to come.

Humpty Dumpty and Global Financial Imbalances
WASHINGTON, DC: There is an old saying that goes, “If you have only a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Nowhere is this clearer than in discussions of the United States’ trade deficit and global financial imbalances, given economists’ tendency to reduce most economic problems to questions of savings.
Unfortunately, this focus on savings distorts understanding and distracts from the real challenge of creating mass consumption markets in developing countries.
Within national income accounts, trade deficits represent the excess of a country’s consumption over production.
From an accountant’s perspective, that makes it logical to label trade deficits as negative savings.
Most economists go a step further, asserting that the US deficit is caused by a savings shortage.
But, since one country’s trade deficit is another’s surplus, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has argued for turning the conventional logic on its head: rather than resulting from a savings shortage, the US trade deficit is the result of a global savings glut – especially in China.
Both stories are flawed.
How does a savings glut translate into exports, given that households do not export?
Likewise, if the US is consuming too much, why has it been closing manufacturing capacity, and why is there so much labor market softness?
Both the savings shortage and savings glut hypotheses confuse accounting outcomes with causes.
Trade deficits reflect transactions between producers and buyers, and those transactions are the result of incentives and price signals.
US consumers buy imports rather than American-made goods because imports are cheaper.
This price advantage is often due to exchange rates in places like China and Japan, whose currencies are undervalued by between 25% and 40%, which often offsets US efficiency advantages.
Undervalued exchange rates are only one of the policies that countries use to boost exports and restrain imports, so that they run trade surpluses, while their trading partners (including the US) run deficits.
Policies aimed at ensuring export-led growth also include export subsidies and barriers to imports.
In the modern era of globalization, export-led growth is supplemented by policies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), a combination that has been particularly successful in China.
Such FDI policies include investment subsidies, tax abatements, and exemptions from domestic regulation and laws.
These policies encourage corporations to shift output to developing countries, which gain modern production capacity.
This increases developing countries exports and reduces their import demand (or increases it at a lower rate than export growth).
Meanwhile, corporations reduce home country manufacturing capacity and investment, which reduces home country exports while increasing imports.
Once again, China provides clear evidence of these patterns, with almost 60% of Chinese exports being produced by foreign corporations.
This story is fundamentally different from the savings shortage and savings glut hypotheses, and it leads to dramatically different policies.
Developing countries need to grow, but nowadays it is easier to acquire capacity and grow through FDI than it is to develop domestic mass consumption markets.
Consequently, rather than facing a savings glut, the global economy faces a problem of demand failure in developing countries.
The challenge is to get corporations to invest in developing countries, but for purposes of producing for local consumers.
That requires expanding markets in developing countries, which means tackling income inequality and getting income into the right hands – an enormous organizational challenge that is off the radar because economists focus exclusively on savings and supply-side issues.
Labor standards, minimum wages, and unions are part of the solution, as they were in countries that developed successfully.
Unions have historically been especially important since they engage in decentralized wage bargaining that tie wages to firms’ productivity.
Consequently, wages are market sustainable.
Government spending can also help, but its role is limited.
Countries that substitute government spending for market spending either generate inflationary budget deficits, or end up with excessively high tax rates that destroy incentives.
But no solution is possible until we abandon the savings shortage and savings glut hypotheses and connect today’s global financial imbalances with global production patterns and inadequate demand in developing countries.
Tortuous claims that saving is merely the flip side of consumption and investment spending are the economic equivalent of Humpty Dumpty’s argument in Through the Looking Glass : “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean.”

Demilitarizing Muslim Politics
ISLAMABAD – Can Muslim governments free themselves from their countries’ powerful militaries and establish civilian control comparable to that found in liberal democracies?
This question is now paramount in countries as disparate as Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey.
To predict how this struggle will play out, it helps to understand the region’s past.
Since Islam’s founding in the seventh century, it has maintained a tradition of deep military engagement in politics and governance.
Indeed, Islam’s increasing military prowess helped it to spread rapidly around the world.
The military was responsible for Islam’s implantation throughout the Middle East, as well as in Persia, Southern Europe, and the Indian sub-continent.
And once a Muslim state was established in newly conquered lands, the military became integral to its governance.
The military’s incorporation into the state was most prominent in the Ottoman Empire, whose rulers created a new type of military force that drew its manpower mostly from Islamic-ruled parts of Europe.
These Janissaries (Christian boys conscripted to serve in Ottoman infantry units) were either recruited from Europe or abducted from countries under Ottoman control.
Janissaries were not allowed to marry or to own property, which prevented them from developing loyalties outside of the imperial court.
But, after these restrictions were removed in the sixteenth century, and up until their extermination in the nineteenth century, the Janissaries became extremely powerful in Istanbul (and even established their own dynasty in Egypt).
Military domination in Muslim countries survived right up to the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early twentieth century.
The colonial powers that filled the vacuum left by the declining empire had their own militaries, and therefore did not need local forces to govern.
But when Europeans withdrew from the Muslim world in the twentieth century, these forces rushed back in to wrest control of politics.
The military rose to power in Egypt, Pakistan, and other Arab countries in the early and mid-twentieth century.
In Turkey, the military proclaimed itself the guardian of the secular Republic of Turkey, founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, himself a military man.
Today, the revolutions rocking much of the Muslim world are bedeviled by Islam’s military past.
In the first phase of these popular uprisings, those who had been politically and economically excluded began to demand inclusion and participation.
Now a second phase is underway, marked by a serious effort to divest the old military establishment of its power.
This struggle is manifesting itself in different ways in Egypt, Turkey, and Pakistan.
In Egypt, the military’s takeover of the political transition after the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak is unacceptable to Muslim and secular forces alike.
Most Egyptians want the soldiers to leave politics and return to their barracks.
Essam el-Erian, whose Islamist Freedom and Justice Party recently won the most seats in Egypt’s parliamentary elections, recently said that the Muslim Brotherhood (to which the party is closely tied), does not expect the military rulers to relinquish power voluntarily.
They will have to be persuaded to leave, and, if that does not work, forced out.
The parliament’s first step in ultimately removing them would be to defend its authority to choose the members of a planned 100-person constitutional assembly.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, the Justice and Development Party, which has strong roots in the country’s Islamic tradition, is now seeking to limit the military’s role.
The armed forces, however, claim a constitutional mandate to protect the Republic’s secular traditions.
And Turkey’s generals have intervened in politics several times to defend Kemalism – Atatürk’s secular ideology of modernization that pushed Islamic Turkey towards European-style liberalism.
But, of the three countries, Turkey has most successfully demilitarized its politics.
The charismatic prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, having won three consecutive elections, has been able to exert his authority over the military.
Controversially, he has jailed the army’s top general, İlker Başbuğ, whom Turkish prosecutors have accused – many say implausibly – of plotting to overthrow the government.
Finally, Pakistan’s military, which has governed the country for half of its 64-year history, is fighting hard to retain influence over policymaking.
Humbled by its inability to control United States military operations, including the one that killed Osama bin Laden, the army is struggling to play a hand in the country’s evolving relations with India and the US.
Nevertheless, wary of provoking widespread hostility, military leaders have indicated recently that they have no intention of intervening in politics.
Since the Arab Spring began, four long-established regimes have been removed, while others are under increasing pressure, giving ordinary Arabs hope that their demands will no longer be ignored, and that those who govern will be mindful of citizens’ needs.
But that – the real revolution – will happen only when true representatives of citizens, rather than the military, begin to set their countries’ political course.

Palestinian Refugees and German Expellees
The atmosphere could not have been more tranquil: a former royal castle in the rolling hills of the Taunus region near Frankfurt, where statesmen and politicians held an annual meeting dealing with the Middle East.
Europeans and Americans, Israelis and Iranians, Egyptians and Turks, Palestinians and Tunisians rubbed shoulders.
The novelty this year was the presence of representatives from post-Saddam Iraq, among them an official from the Kurdish Regional Government, as well as a high ranking Shi'a representative.
The new situation in Iraq, along with the Middle East road map, were at the center of attention.
On the opening night, a senior German government minister, himself deeply involved in Middle Eastern affairs, addressed both subjects, displaying great sensitivity both to Israeli and Palestinian concerns.
The evening proceeded along the expected anodyne trajectory until a Lebanese academic raised the issue of the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.
The senior German minister listened attentively, and then said: ``This is an issue with which we in Germany are familiar; may I ask my German colleagues in the audience to raise their hand if they, or their families, have been refugees from Eastern Europe?''
There was a moment of silence.
The issue is embarrassing in Germany, fraught with political and moral landmines.
Slowly, hands were raised: by my count, more than half of the Germans present (government officials, journalists, businessmen) raised a hand: they, or their families, had been Vertriebene --expelled from their ancestral homes in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia after World War II.
It is estimated that up to 10 million were expelled, and with their descendants they make up today almost double that number--almost one in four Germans.
In the hushed room, the senior German minister continued: he himself was born in Eastern Europe, and his family was expelled in the post-1945 anti-German atmosphere. ``But,'' he added, ``neither I nor any of my colleagues claim the right to go back.
It is precisely because of this that I can now visit my ancestral hometown and talk to the people who now live in the house in which I was born--because they do not feel threatened, because they know I don't want to displace them or take their house.''
The minister went on to explain that peace in Europe is today embedded in this realization: if East European countries had thought that millions of ethnic Germans would like to return, ``the Iron Curtain would have never come down.''
It was a highly emotional response to the Lebanese academic's question--one that Arab representatives chose later on to ignore.
But it was just one more expression of the context in which the issue of the 1948 Palestinian refugees has to be addressed.
As the German senior minister reminded the audience, there are numerous parallels in recent history to the Palestinian refugee problem.
Anyone who now claims that the 1948 Palestinian refugees have a claim, in principle, to return to Israel, must confront the question: should the millions of Germans expelled from Eastern Europe after 1945 also have the same right of return to their lost homes?
The German minister supplied the answer.
Similarly, if Helmut Kohl's government had insisted in 1990 that all Germans expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia have a right to return to those countries, German reunification would not have gained the broad international agreement that it did.
It would be clear that what West Germany had in mind was not reunification, but reversing the consequences of Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945.
The Palestinians' demand for the right of return has an analogous meaning.
Insistence on it in 2000 at Camp David and Taba made clear to most Israelis that what the Palestinians have in mind is not undoing the consequences of the Six Day War in 1967.
Rather, the demand for a right of return amounts to an effort to reverse the consequences of their defeat in 1948, when the Arab world went to war to prevent the state of Israel from being born.
It is worth keeping in mind what advocates of a Palestinian right of return now prefer to forget: Palestinian Arabs and four Arab members of the UN went to war in 1948 not only against Israel, but against international legitimacy and the UN plan for a two-state solution.
There is no other example of UN member countries going to war to prevent implementation of UN decisions.
This is what the Arab countries and the Palestinians did.
Clearly there is a serious humanitarian issue involved.
The fact that the refugees' plight was compounded by their use as political pawns for half a century is a measure of the cynicism and immorality of Arab political leadership.
Nonetheless, the humanitarian issue remains.
The senior German minister referred to it explicitly, both with regard to the Palestinians and the post-1945 German refugees.
But the political consequences for him were clear: the revanchist call for a return of refugees--in both the German and the Palestinian case--is a formula for instability, if not war.

The Future is Old
MUNICH – The aging of our societies is one of the greatest success stories of the twentieth century.
More than three decades have been added to the lives of hundreds of millions of people over the last hundred years.
This is an accomplishment well worth celebrating; but we must also bear in mind that with increased longevity come significant long-term economic consequences – and that many societies are aging at a record speed.
Last year, the OECD warned that the world was aging at an unprecedented rate and that this could help slow global annual economic growth from an average of 3.6% this decade to about 2.4% from 2050 to 2060.
OECD countries in particular will be hit by a double demographic shock.
Not only will their societies be rapidly aging; diminishing income gaps between rich countries and emerging economies are likely to slow immigration flows, shrinking the workforce by 20% in the eurozone and 15% in the United States.
Demographic researchers divide countries into four categories, according to the share of the over-65 population: young (less than 7% aged 65 or over), aging (7-13%), aged (14-20%), and super-aged (more than 21%).
Today, just three countries – Germany (21%), Italy (22%), and Japan (26%) – qualify as super-aged societies.
In the next five years, they are expected to be joined by Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, and Portugal.
In the following decade, Europe will continue to age, with another 17 countries, including Austria, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, expected to become super-aged, along with Canada, Cuba, and South Korea.
During this period, the challenges of rapid societal aging will confront mainly the developed world.
But, by 2040 some 55 countries will be struggling to manage an older population, with the US, China, Singapore, Thailand, and Puerto Rico joining the ranks of the super-aged.
What makes the phenomenon even more remarkable is the speed at which these transitions are taking place.
When France went from being a young country to an aging one in 1850, slavery was still legal in the US, the light bulb had yet to be invented, and Germany had yet to become a unified country. It took another 130 years, for the country to become an aged society in 1980.
France is expected to become super-aged in 2023.
For many years, Japan was considered to have the most rapidly aging population on earth.
It went from having the youngest population among G-7 countries in the early 1960s to being the world’s oldest country in 2008.
But if current projections hold true, several countries will accomplish a similar transformation a decade faster.
Indeed, today the world’s most rapidly aging country is South Korea, which became an aging society in 1999, is expected to become an aged one in 2017, and will be a super-aged one in 2027.
In other words, South Korea will undergo in less than three decades a transformation that will have taken France nearly 175 years.
And while South Korea may be getting old the fastest, it leads a closely bunched group of countries that includes Bangladesh, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Iran, still categorized as young, is another contender for the title of fastest-aging country.
Aging is a product of rising life expectancies and falling fertility rates.
The speed of the decline in fertility rates has been dramatic around the world; in Iran, it has been nothing less than astonishing, dropping from seven children per woman in 1984 to 1.9 in 2006.
This will certainly have long-term consequences as the working-age population declines and the elderly population soars.
Iran is expected to stay young until after 2020, but could then become super-aged less than 30 years later.
And yet, whatever the adverse economic impact of aging, it is important to consider the alternative.
Countries such as Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe have among the lowest life expectancies on the planet.
They face many challenges – famine, corruption, conflict, lack of access to clean water and education, AIDS, and Ebola – but rapid societal aging is not one of them.
A rapidly aging population may be a problem, but, overall, it is a pretty good problem to have.

Haiti and the Limits of Generosity
MELBOURNE – All over the world, people have responded generously to the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti.
In just three days, more than a million Americans had donated $10 with the aid of text messages from their cellphones.
People with very little themselves, like Maria Pacheco, an unemployed single mother from Chicago, donated food and clothes.
Others did whatever they could – from pedicures to washing cars – to raise money.
On current indications, the amount Americans will give to relief efforts in Haiti could surpass the $1.9 billion they gave to assist victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which until now has stood as a record for donations to a disaster outside the United States.
Given that the US is undergoing economic hard times, the size of the response has surprised many.
Haiti ’s proximity, plus the fact that close to a million Haitians live in the US, goes some way towards explaining why Americans have responded so generously.
But the response has been worldwide.
In Melbourne for the Australian Open, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and other stars held an exhibition match that led to donations of $600,000.
In Rwanda, a group of community health workers making less than $200 a month raised $7,000 for Haiti.
All of this raises many questions about how we respond – and how we should respond – to such tragedies.
The earthquake killed up to 200,000 people.
Terrible as that is, it is fewer than the number of children who, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF, die every 10 days from avoidable, poverty-related causes.
Moreover, as Elie Hassenfeld has argued on GiveWell.net, there are good grounds for thinking that disaster relief is less cost-effective than aid aimed at saving the lives of those who are risk from extreme poverty.
Why do people give generously to earthquake victims, but not to prevent the much larger number of deaths brought about by extreme poverty, insufficient food, unsafe water, lack of sanitation, and the absence of even the most basic health care?
Media saturation obviously makes a critical difference.
Scenes from Hurricane Katrina, the Asian tsunami, and now the Haitian earthquake were shown over and over again on all television news broadcasts.
An earthquake in a remote part of Pakistan that killed 80,000 people received relatively little television coverage, and a much less generous response.
The daily deaths of children in poor countries from diarrhea, measles, and malaria are part of the background of the world we live in, and so are not news at all.
Suppose that a million children all in one place seemed likely to be swept away and drowned by approaching floodwaters.
The media coverage would be enormous.
Now imagine the jubilation if they were saved!
And imagine the acclaim for the heroes who had saved so many children.
Yet when UNICEF announced, in September of last year, that the number of children dying each year from poverty-related causes had dropped by one million, as compared to two years earlier, the story got very little media attention.
The people who contributed to this drop by delivering effective basic health care, building a supply of safe water, or immunizing children against measles remain largely unknown.
Perhaps people respond more generously to the victims of natural disasters than they do to those in extreme poverty because, after a natural disaster, we tend not to blame the victims.
We seem to accept that to be struck by an earthquake, a tidal wave, or a hurricane is just bad luck (unless, as the American evangelist Pat Robertson suggested after the Haitian earthquake, your ancestors made a pact with the devil in order to free themselves from colonial rule).
Still, many people profess to believe that poverty is the result of not working hard enough, or of having too many children.
But the circumstances that produce extreme poverty are not, except in rare cases, under the control of such poor people.
They may be, to some extent, under the control of governments, and undoubtedly bad government is a major contributor to poverty.
But then, bad government can also contribute to the toll exacted by a natural disaster.
Two years ago, a team of geophysicists led by Eric Calais of Purdue University predicted that the fault that produced the recent Haitian earthquake was at high risk of doing exactly what it did.
They urged the Haitian government to take steps to strengthen critical buildings, including hospitals and schools.
Failure to do so contributed to the toll.
What should we do?
Brian Tucker, founder of the non-profit organization Geohazards International, urges that 10% of the money raised by relief efforts should be set aside for mitigating damage from future earthquakes: training builders, improving engineering, and making the public more aware of the risks and how to reduce them.
He claims that every dollar invested in preparing for natural disasters saves ten dollars in future damage.
Tucker’s proposal makes good sense, but it is difficult – and arguably unethical – for charities that raised money to help Haitians now to divert some of those funds to programs to mitigate the damage caused by future earthquakes.
It would be excellent if the general public responded to an appeal for funds for mitigating future damage.
But the prospects of that happening are slim, because such an appeal would lack the emotional pull of the desire to help immediate victims.
Instead, governments that are pledging aid to Haiti now should ensure that part of their assistance goes to reducing the chances that such a disaster will affect Haiti so dramatically again.

Capitalizing on Women’s Ventures
LUXEMBOURG – If you are a venture capitalist, you are almost certainly a man.
But you would do well to know that your best chance to outperform the market is to invest your money in a company led by a woman.
That rule of thumb – cherchez la femme – would radically simplify complicated VC investment decisions.
Yet, because men make up 91% of the VC industry’s executive ranks, the bottom-line performance of women-led companies has been chronically overlooked.
Securing funding to enable women-led businesses to reach their potential is needed to drive European innovation.
The annual productivity loss to the European Union as a result of women leaving their jobs in information and communications technology (ICT) is around €16.2 billion ($19.1 billion).
Though women represent roughly 52% of Europe’s overall population, they constitute only 34% of the EU’s self-employed workers, and 30% of its start-up entrepreneurs.
Worse, in 2017, women-led ICT companies accounted for less than 10% of VC invested across the continent.
Research suggests that women-led companies, displaying some degree of risk aversion, are less inclined to pursue external financing options.
Even when women starting new enterprises in the EU are aware of their opportunities to secure external funding, many still prefer to provide a significant level of start-up capital by themselves.
As such, female founders are less likely than male founders to pursue VC investment.
The relative lack of female entrepreneurs, combined with women’s self-reported preference for “bootstrapping” their businesses, appears to have contributed to a reduced overall demand for external financing in Europe.
The situation in the United States is even worse.
There, roughly four out of five VC firms have never employed a woman in a senior investment role.
Just one of every ten new hires is a woman.
All told, a combination of risk aversion on the part of women, gender bias on the part of men, and the lack of female representation among investors and founders creates a vicious cycle that has been difficult to break.
That’s the bad news.
The good news is that the cycle can be broken, especially when one considers women entrepreneurs’ far-reaching potential as innovators and job creators.
Women-led businesses tend to attract more investment at later stages than their male-led counterparts.
They also outperform the market in terms of median revenues, and are more likely to provide employment for other female entrepreneurs.
These are just a few of the findings of a European Investment Bank Advisory Report that was released in early July.
In fact, the EIB also finds that women-led VC-backed companies in the EU enjoy higher exit rates in terms of deal value and volume.
Mature VC-funded companies tend to hire more women in general, and this has contributed to a recent increase in funding for businesses founded by women or with women in executive roles.
Equally promising, the European venture community has begun investing in women-led companies at an annual rate above that of overall investment growth in the region.
Global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the need for more finance for female entrepreneurs, who have a critical role to play in responding to market shocks and contributing to economic recoveries.
Amid the turmoil of the current crisis, there is an opportunity to encourage more gender-balanced innovation.
But, to make progress toward gender parity and reap the full benefits of diversity, there will need to be fundamental changes in attitudes, business cultures, and institutions.
The EIB itself has been making a concerted effort to improve gender diversity within its ranks.
But with just three female members (including me) on the nine-member Management Committee, it still has a way to go.
Beyond establishing a better gender balance among the leadership ranks, the EIB Group also must ensure that its financing decisions benefit all members of the community equally.
To that end, the Bank has adopted a Strategy on Gender Equality and Women’s Economic Empowerment based on three pillars: protection, impact, and investment.
The goal is to help identify innovative, high-growth female-led companies, and then provide advice, financing options, and assistance making connections with other market players.
So far, these include lenders such as Spain’s CaixaBank, Romania’s Garanti Bank, the Netherlands’ Karmijn Kapitaal, and Italy’s UniCredit.
Other investment and development banks around the world should consider adopting a similar model.
With a strong partnership between public banks and private investors, we can encourage VCs and other sources of finance to adopt a more gender-balanced approach.
Ensuring access to finance for women-led enterprises ultimately creates jobs and contributes to our shared prosperity.
Not only does empowering women make ethical and social sense, but it also happens to be good for business.

In Defense of Economic Populism
CAMBRIDGE – Populists abhor restraints on the political executive.
Since they claim to represent “the people” writ large, they regard limits on their exercise of power as necessarily undermining the popular will.
Such constraints can only serve the “enemies of the people” – minorities and foreigners (for right-wing populists) or financial elites (in the case of left-wing populists).
This is a dangerous approach to politics, because it allows a majority to ride roughshod over the rights of minorities.
Without separation of powers, an independent judiciary, or free media – which all populist autocrats, from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump detest – democracy degenerates into the tyranny of whoever happens to be in power.
Periodic elections under populist rule become a smokescreen.
In the absence of the rule of law and basic civil liberties, populist regimes can prolong their rule by manipulating the media and the judiciary at will.
Populists’ aversion to institutional restraints extends to the economy, where exercising full control “in the people’s interest” implies that no obstacles should be placed in their way by autonomous regulatory agencies, independent central banks, or global trade rules.
But while populism in the political domain is almost always harmful, economic populism can sometimes be justified.
Start with why restraints on economic policy may be desirable in the first place.
Economists tend to have a soft spot for such restraints, because policymaking that is fully responsive to the push and pull of domestic politics can generate highly inefficient outcomes.
In particular, economic policy is often subject to the problem of what economists call time-inconsistency: short-term interests frequently undermine the pursuit of policies that are far more desirable in the long term.
A canonical example is discretionary monetary policy.
Politicians who have the power to print money at will may generate “surprise inflation” to boost output and employment in the short run – say, before an election.
But this backfires, because firms and households adjust their inflation expectations.
In the end, discretionary monetary policy results only in higher inflation without yielding any output or employment gains.
The solution is an independent central bank, insulated from politics, operating solely on its mandate to maintain price stability.
The costs of macroeconomic populism are familiar from Latin America.
As Jeffrey D. Sachs, Sebastián Edwards, and Rüdiger Dornbusch argued years ago, unsustainable monetary and fiscal policies were the bane of the region until economic orthodoxy began to prevail in the 1990s.
Populist policies periodically produced painful economic crises, which hurt the poor the most.
To break this cycle, the region turned to fiscal rules and technocratic finance ministers.
Another example is official treatment of foreign investors.
Once a foreign firm makes its investment, it essentially becomes captive to the host government’s whims.
Promises that were made to attract the firm are easily forgotten, replaced by policies that squeeze it to the benefit of the national budget or domestic companies.
But investors are not stupid, and, fearing this outcome, they invest elsewhere.
Governments’ need to establish their credibility has thus given rise to trade agreements with so-called investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses, allowing the firm to sue the government in international tribunals.
These are examples of restraints on economic policy that take the form of delegation to autonomous agencies, technocrats, or external rules.
As described, they serve the valuable function of preventing those in power from shooting themselves in the foot by pursuing short-sighted policies.
But there are other scenarios as well, in which the consequences of restraints on economic policy may be less salutary.
In particular, restraints may be instituted by special interests or elites themselves, to cement permanent control over policymaking.
In such cases, delegation to autonomous agencies or signing on to global rules does not serve society, but only a narrow caste of “insiders.”
Part of today’s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades.
Multinational corporations and investors have increasingly shaped the agenda of international trade negotiations, resulting in global regimes that disproportionately benefit capital at the expense of labor.
Stringent patent rules and international investor tribunals are prime examples.
So is the capture of autonomous agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate.
Banks and other financial institutions have been especially successful at getting their way and instituting rules that give them free rein.
Independent central banks played a critical role in bringing inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s.
But in the current low-inflation environment, their exclusive focus on price stability imparts a deflationary bias to economic policy and is in tension with employment generation and growth.
Such “liberal technocracy” may be at its apogee in the European Union, where economic rules and regulations are designed at considerable remove from democratic deliberation at the national level.
And in virtually every member state, this political gap – the EU’s so-called democratic deficit – has given rise to populist, Euroskeptical political parties.
In such cases, relaxing the constraints on economic policy and returning policymaking autonomy to elected governments may well be desirable.
Exceptional times require the freedom to experiment in economic policy.
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal provides an apt historical example.
FDR’s reforms required that he remove the economic shackles imposed by conservative judges and financial interests at home and by the gold standard abroad.
We should constantly be wary of populism that stifles political pluralism and undermines liberal democratic norms.
Political populism is a menace to be avoided at all costs.
Economic populism, by contrast, is occasionally necessary.
Indeed, at such times, it may be the only way to forestall its much more dangerous political cousin.

Ending Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists
PARIS – In many ways, there has never been a more dangerous time for journalists than the present.
With simultaneous crises threatening media freedom and sustainability, this decade will be decisive for the future of a vocation that is crucial for societies’ well-being.
What would the world look like if there were no professional, ethical journalists to report the news?
Worryingly, this question is no longer hypothetical.
The issue of reporters’ safety remains vitally important.
Although killings of journalists have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, threats to their safety continue to evolve and increase.
These threats are also becoming more nuanced and harder to combat.
Last year, more journalists were killed in countries supposedly at peace than in war zones, and the percentage of reporters killed on the job who were deliberately targeted was higher than ever before.
Many of the victims were working to expose corruption and report on other sensitive topics.
Just a few days ago, on October 29, reporter Arturo Alba Medina was killed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, near the US border.
He was the sixth journalist murdered this year in Mexico, which remains the deadliest country not at war.
In the past decade alone, nearly 1,000 journalists globally have been killed in connection with their work.
Many of these cases have never been properly investigated, and the vast majority of perpetrators have never been held to account.
This is largely because of the lack of effective mechanisms of accountability to ensure that justice is served.
This year’s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, on November 2, is an ideal opportunity to start taking concrete action to end this endemic impunity for good.
The United Nations should appoint a Special Representative for the Safety of Journalists, with the aim of enforcing international law and thereby finally reducing the number of reporters killed every year in the course of their work.
The Reporters Without Borders (RSF) campaign to establish a special representative has gained tremendous momentum in recent years, but one obstacle remains.
Because the appointee would be a representative of the UN secretary-general, we need the secretary-general’s active support.
Unfortunately, António Guterres has not yet lived up to the promise he made when we met one month after he took office in 2017: “It will take time, but I will do it,” he told me.
Guterres now has a little more than a year of his current term remaining.
That is more than enough time to ensure meaningful action to end impunity and protect journalists.
Guterres’s appointment of a member of his staff as a contact person on this issue – the only concrete step he has taken so far – is not enough.
The mandate for a special representative would not be merely a paper-based exercise that generates more reporting.
Rather, it would be a means of bringing together the relevant existing UN mechanisms, resolutions, and recommendations to ensure meaningful coordination and implementation to achieve accountability for crimes committed against journalists everywhere.
Appointing a special representative would ensure that good intentions lead to real-world results.
Tangible impact is desperately needed in many of the cases in which RSF is involved – including that of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and dismembered inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
Many of the cases concern investigative journalists, including Daphne Caruana Galizia, assassinated in 2017 by a car bomb outside her home in Malta; Ján Kuciak, shot dead in 2018 along with his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, inside their home in Slovakia; the Belarusian journalist Pavel Sheremet, killed by a car bomb in 2016 in Kyiv; and the Ghanaian journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale, shot three times in 2019 while driving his car in Accra.
There are many other cases.
The young freelance journalist Christopher Allen was killed in 2017 while reporting on the civil conflict in South Sudan, and Kirill Radtchenko, Alexandre Rasstorgouïev, and Orhan Djemal were murdered in 2018 while making a documentary about Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic.
Enough is enough.
RSF calls for concrete action now to end violence against all journalists, wherever they live and work.
We call on the UN secretary-general to support the establishment of a Special Representative for the Safety of Journalists, and for member states to enable and support the work of this crucial mandate.
Finally, we call on the international public – and decision-makers – to join our campaign to end impunity for crimes against journalists once and for all.

The Global QE Exit Crisis
NEW HAVEN – The global economy could be in the early stages of another crisis.
Once again, the US Federal Reserve is in the eye of the storm.
As the Fed attempts to exit from so-called quantitative easing (QE) – its unprecedented policy of massive purchases of long-term assets – many high-flying emerging economies suddenly find themselves in a vise.
Currency and stock markets in India and Indonesia are plunging, with collateral damage evident in Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey.
The Fed insists that it is blameless – the same absurd position that it took in the aftermath of the Great Crisis of 2008-2009, when it maintained that its excessive monetary accommodation had nothing to do with the property and credit bubbles that nearly pushed the world into the abyss.
It remains steeped in denial: Were it not for the interest-rate suppression that QE has imposed on developed countries since 2009, the search for yield would not have flooded emerging economies with short-term “hot” money.
As in the mid-2000’s, there is plenty of blame to go around this time as well.
The Fed is hardly alone in embracing unconventional monetary easing.
Moreover, the aforementioned developing economies all have one thing in common: large current-account deficits.
According to the International Monetary Fund, India’s external deficit, for example, is likely to average 5% of GDP in 2012-2013, compared to 2.8% in 2008-2011.
Similarly, Indonesia’s current-account deficit, at 3% of GDP in 2012-2013, represents an even sharper deterioration from surpluses that averaged 0.7% of GDP in 2008-2011.
Comparable patterns are evident in Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey.
A large current-account deficit is a classic symptom of a pre-crisis economy living beyond its means – in effect, investing more than it is saving.
The only way to sustain economic growth in the face of such an imbalance is to borrow surplus savings from abroad.
That is where QE came into play.
It provided a surplus of yield-seeking capital from investors in developed countries, thereby allowing emerging economies to remain on high-growth trajectories.
IMF research puts emerging markets’ cumulative capital inflows at close to $4 trillion since the onset of QE in 2009.
Enticed by the siren song of a shortcut to rapid economic growth, these inflows lulled emerging-market countries into believing that their imbalances were sustainable, enabling them to avoid the discipline needed to put their economies on more stable and viable paths.
This is an endemic feature of the modern global economy.
Rather than owning up to the economic slowdown that current-account deficits signal – accepting a little less growth today for more sustainable growth in the future – politicians and policymakers opt for risky growth gambits that ultimately backfire.
That has been the case in developing Asia, not just in India and Indonesia today, but also in the 1990’s, when sharply widening current-account deficits were a harbinger of the wrenching financial crisis of 1997-1998. But it has been equally true of the developed world.
America’s gaping current-account deficit of the mid-2000’s was, in fact, a glaring warning of the distortions created by a shift to asset-dependent saving at a time when dangerous bubbles were forming in asset and credit markets.
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis is an outgrowth of sharp disparities between the peripheral economies with outsize current-account deficits – especially Greece, Portugal, and Spain – and core countries like Germany, with large surpluses.
Central bankers have done everything in their power to finesse these problems.
Under the leadership of Ben Bernanke and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, the Fed condoned asset and credit bubbles, treating them as new sources of economic growth.
Bernanke has gone even further, arguing that the growth windfall from QE would be more than sufficient to compensate for any destabilizing hot-money flows in and out of emerging economies.
Yet the absence of any such growth windfall in a still-sluggish US economy has unmasked QE as little more than a yield-seeking liquidity foil.
The QE exit strategy, if the Fed ever summons the courage to pull it off, would do little more than redirect surplus liquidity from higher-yielding developing markets back to home markets.
At present, with the Fed hinting at the first phase of the exit – the so-called QE taper – financial markets are already responding to expectations of reduced money creation and eventual increases in interest rates in the developed world.
Never mind the Fed’s promises that any such moves will be glacial – that it is unlikely to trigger any meaningful increases in policy rates until 2014 or 2015.
As the more than 1.1 percentage-point increase in 10-year Treasury yields over the past year indicates, markets have an uncanny knack for discounting glacial events in a short period of time.
Courtesy of that discounting mechanism, the risk-adjusted yield arbitrage has now started to move against emerging-market securities.
Not surprisingly, those economies with current-account deficits are feeling the heat first.
Suddenly, their saving-investment imbalances are harder to fund in a post-QE regime, an outcome that has taken a wrenching toll on currencies in India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Turkey.
As a result, these countries have been left ensnared in policy traps: Orthodox defense strategies for plunging currencies usually entail higher interest rates – an unpalatable option for emerging economies that are also experiencing downward pressure on economic growth.
Where this stops, nobody knows.
That was the case in Asia in the late 1990’s, as well as in the US in 2009.
But, with more than a dozen major crises hitting the world economy since the early 1980’s, there is no mistaking the message: imbalances are not sustainable, regardless of how hard central banks try to duck the consequences.
Developing economies are now feeling the full force of the Fed’s moment of reckoning.
They are guilty of failing to face up to their own rebalancing during the heady days of the QE sugar high.
And the Fed is just as guilty, if not more so, for orchestrating this failed policy experiment in the first place.

The Problem With “Green” Monetary Policy
FRANKFURT – As an alarming new United Nations report shows, climate change is probably the biggest challenge of our time.
But should central banks also be worrying about the issue?
If so, what should they be doing about it?
Central-bank representatives who do decide to make public speeches about climate change cannot deny the scale and scope of the problem; to do so would be to risk their own credibility.
But the same is true when central bankers feel obliged to discuss the distribution of income and wealth, rising crime rates, or any other newsworthy topic.
The more that central banks’ communications strategy focuses on trying to make themselves “popular” in the public’s eyes, the greater the temptation to address topics outside their primary remit.
Beyond communicating with the public, the question, of course, is whether central banks should try to account for environmental considerations when shaping monetary policy.
Obviously, climate change and corresponding government policies in response to it can have powerful effects on economic development.
These consequences are reflected in all kinds of variables – growth, inflation, employment levels – that will in turn affect central-bank forecasts and influence monetary-policy decisions.
Likewise, natural disasters and other environmental events – actual or potential – can pose implicit risks to entire classes of financial assets.
Regulators and supervisors charged with assessing risk and associated capital needs must take this environmental dimension into account.
At a minimum, the high uncertainty stemming from these risks implies a huge challenge for assessing the stability of the financial system and corresponding macroprudential measures.
And these risk factors are also increasingly relevant for monetary-policy decisions, such as when central banks should buy bonds or (in some cases) equities.
But the growing public demand that central banks contribute more actively to the fight against climate change leads to a different dimension.
In theory, central banks could introduce preferential interest rates for “green” activities – thus driving up the prices of “green bonds” – while adopting a more negative attitude toward noxious assets, such as those tied to fossil fuels.
And yet, assessing whether and to what extent an asset is environmentally harmful or helpful would be extremely difficult.
Putting aside these more technical issues, the broader question remains: Should central banks assume responsibility for implementing policies to combat climate change?
A number of prominent central bankers have already argued that they should.
And current proposals for extending central banks’ mandate have come on top of growing concerns about income distribution and other issues tangentially related to monetary policy.
One is reminded of an ironic comment by the great Chicago School economist Jacob Viner. “If you were to ask me what are the professed goals of most central bankers,” Viner wrote in 1964, “I would say on the basis of what I have heard them say that if they were appearing before a commission … they would either include a wide range of goals, including virtue and motherhood and also everything they could think of which is nice and good, or insist on the lack of power of central banks to serve effectively any specific important goal.”
After having played a decisive role in preventing the world from falling into another 1930s-style depression, central banks after the 2008 financial crisis have been held up as saviors of the world.
The title of “maestro,” once accorded just to former US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, has now been extended to the entire field.
With central bankers at the height of their reputation, it is not surprising that many would now want them to make a substantive contribution to the fight against climate change.
But central bankers should never forget what they are appointed for: namely, to preserve price stability and, in some cases, to support high levels of employment.
Central bankers are not omnipotent, and they should not be made to feel as if they were.
Confronting climate change is above all the responsibility of governments and legislatures that are exposed to the risk of losing elections.
Climate policies that will affect social and economic arrangements across all of society belong in the hands of those who are directly answerable to voters.
Central bankers who would assume responsibility for tackling climate change are acting out of pretention, and could well undermine the very independence upon which their institutions rely.
Central banks were not made independent so that they could extend their own mandates.
And where environmental issues are among their secondary objectives, central banks should warn against exaggerated expectations regarding their contribution.
Making themselves publicly accountable beyond their limited capability in this field must lead to disappointment and undermine their reputation.
There can be no such thing as a “green” monetary policy.
A policy domain far outside of central banks’ proper mandate cannot be brought within it, and attempts to do so will inevitably end more or less badly.

Fiscal Capture at the ECB
LONDON – Since the second quarter of 2021, inflation in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the eurozone has far exceeded their central banks’ 2% target.
This surge could well be explained by the unexpected severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine, and repeated errors of judgment by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, and the European Central Bank.
But another possible explanation is that monetary policy has been subject to fiscal dominance or fiscal capture.
In this interpretation, major central banks have engaged in aggressive low-interest-rate and asset-purchase policies to support their governments’ expansionary fiscal policies, even though they knew such policies were likely to run counter to their price-stability mandates and were not necessary to preserve financial stability.
The “fiscal capture” interpretation is particularly convincing for the ECB, which must deal with several sovereigns that are facing debt-sustainability issues.
Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are all fiscally fragile.
And France, Belgium, and Cyprus could also face sovereign-funding problems when the next cyclical downturn hits, or when risk-free interest rates normalize from the past decade’s extraordinarily low levels, or when sovereign risk is priced more realistically.
In April 2022, headline inflation for the eurozone was 7.5%, and core inflation (excluding food and energy) was 3.5%.
Yet the ECB remains very concerned with financing sovereign deficits.
This was apparent in its March 24, 2022, announcement that it would continue to accept Greek government bonds as collateral until at least the end of 2024.
Greek sovereign debt does not meet the ECB’s investment-grade credit requirement, but it has been purchased and held by the Eurosystem (the ECB and member states’ central banks) under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) since March 2020.
In December 2021, the ECB Governing Council announced that it would discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
But it also decided that the maturing principal payments would be reinvested until at least the end of 2024, so that “the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio [could] be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary stance.”
Moreover, in March 2022, the Governing Council made clear that it might continue to buy and accept as collateral the debt of other governments that could fall below investment grade.
The ECB “reserves the right to deviate also in the future from credit rating agencies’ ratings if warranted, in line with its discretion under the monetary policy framework, thereby avoiding mechanistic reliance on these ratings.”
All told, the Eurosystem’s holdings of public-sector securities under the PEPP at the end of March 2022 amounted to more than €1.6 trillion ($1.7 trillion), or 13.4% of 2021 eurozone GDP, and cumulative net purchases of Greek sovereign debt under the PEPP were €38.5 billion (21.1% of Greece’s 2021 GDP).
For Portugal, Italy, and Spain, the corresponding GDP shares of net PEPP purchases were 16.4%, 16%, and 15.7%, respectively.
The Eurosystem’s Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP) also made net purchases of investment-grade sovereign debt.
From November 2019 until the end of March 2022, these totaled €503.6 billion, or 4.1% of eurozone GDP.
In total, the Eurosystem bought more than 120% of net eurozone sovereign debt issuances in 2020 and 2021.
Now, the ECB is said to be working on a “new instrument” to support eurozone member states confronting higher borrowing costs stemming from the ECB’s own expected future policy-rate increases.
Sovereign yield spreads on risky eurozone sovereign debt are rising again – with the Italy-Germany ten-year yield spread reaching 2% on May 10, 2022 – at a time when many vulnerable sovereigns are still planning additional large net debt issuances.
I expect that either the PSPP eligibility rules will be changed to allow the purchase of sub-investment grade debt, or that a new PEPP-like facility will be created for the purpose.
Either way, the ECB is the only institution with the resources and the necessary reaction speed to engage in fiscal-rescue operations.
The entity specifically created to address eurozone sovereign debt issues, the European Stability Mechanism, has neither the deep pockets nor the flexibility to respond promptly and decisively to a looming sovereign funding crisis.
Indeed, as of April 2022, the total amount of loans disbursed by the ESM (and its predecessor) since 2010 was just €295 billion, or 2.4% of GDP.
And Germany has just rejected a proposal by the ESM to create a new permanent aid fund worth €250 billion (about 2% of eurozone GDP).
Whenever the ECB starts raising its policy rates (which should be soon, though it will be too little, too late), I expect that it will continue its bond purchases.
Most likely, these will be targeted at the high-risk sovereign debt issued by countries like Greece and Italy, though targeted purchases of corporate bonds and asset-backed securities could also be part of the “new purchase program.”
When such asset purchases occur under disorderly market conditions, they can be justified as “market maker of last resort” measures.
That will likely be the case with Eurosystem purchases of corporate debt, provided that these are reversed as soon as orderly market conditions are restored.
But by becoming a long-term holder of a growing stock of vulnerable sovereign debt, which is not justifiable on the grounds of systemic financial stability, the Eurosystem will be engaging in still more fiscal-support (and sometimes fiscal-rescue) operations.
No member-state finance minister is laying siege to the ECB’s headquarters, of course, so one could argue that this manifestation of fiscal capture is voluntary or internalized.
But that does not mean it is not detrimental to the objective of price stability.

Madmen in Authority
PRINCETON – In The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John Maynard Keynes famously worried that, “Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.”
Yet even without prescriptive theories, feigning “frenzy” or madness can also be a plausible, powerful, and rather contagious negotiating strategy.
In the early 1970s, US President Richard Nixon adopted the tactic to convince the North Vietnamese that he had his finger on the “nuclear button,” and that they had better negotiate a deal to end the war – or else.
And in 1986, President Ronald Reagan met with Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik and surprised him by proposing that the United States and the Soviet Union both destroy all of their nuclear weapons.
Whether a crisis is escalating or de-escalating, the madman strategy’s effectiveness seems to depend on the extent to which a political leader’s “insanity” is ambiguous – so much so that even historians won’t know where to draw the line between sincerity and artifice.
With President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again approach to a nuclear summit with North Korea, along with his bluster over new sanctions against Iran, the madman strategy seems to have made a dramatic comeback.
It is now being adopted by many other leaders, and quickly spilling over into new domains, including debates about reforming the European monetary and political system.
Recently, the eurozone debt crisis, dormant since 2012, has looked as though it could erupt again.
With interest rates so low, the Italian government’s massive public debt has appeared sustainable.
But with financial markets increasingly jittery over political developments in Italy, it is easy to imagine a world in which interest rates rise and remain elevated, in which case the Italian debt could pose a serious threat to the eurozone, and even to the global economy.
Investors’ fear of another eurozone debt crisis have been spiking since the populist Five Star Movement and right-wing League party failed to form a government after months of post-election gridlock.
The M5S/League coalition, which won a combined parliamentary majority in the March 4 election, have clearly taken a page out of the Trump playbook, hoping to use Italy’s debt to extract concessions from the EU.
Will it work?
The first, and most basic, component of the madman strategy is an ability to introduce a level of uncertainty that is damaging to other countries.
This is why the strategy doesn’t really work for smaller countries, as Greece’s new government in 2015 quickly learned after dabbling in brinkmanship with its European creditors.
Assuming a country is big enough to rattle global markets (as Italy clearly is), three other factors determine the success of a madman strategy.
For starters, its government must be able to convince everyone else that it is being driven toward “insane” acts by voters.
The idea is that it is actually irrational for a democratically elected government to act prudently if doing so means inviting punishment from voters who are committed to myopic but deeply felt positions.
In the case of Italy, populists capitalized on voters’ disenchantment with a center-left party whose pro-European stance had failed to deliver results.
There must also be a visible division between “hawks” and “doves” within the madman government.
In any negotiation, the other parties will offer concessions to strengthen the doves, knowing full well that a failure to do so will enrage the hawks, who will then move forward with their doomsday plans.
With Trump, this dynamic exists within a single personality that is prone to violent, unpredictable swings between openness and anger.
But it also exists within Trump’s cabinet, with John Bolton, the hardline national security adviser, playing the role of the hawk.
In the case of the M5S/League coalition, a hawk was needed as a counterweight to Italy’s pro-EU president, Sergio Mattarella.
That is why the populists’ choice for Minister of Economy and Finance was Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist whom the former Italian economy minister Vincenzo Visco has described as “radically and suicidally anti-German.”
When Mattarella rejected the nomination, the M5S/League quit the talks, precipitating the current crisis.
Finally, to succeed, a madman government needs to have a plausible war plan for causing a general disruption.
For example, the M5S/League coalition suggested that it might issue a parallel currency, which lent further credibility to its threat of pursuing fiscal expansion in defiance of EU rules.
As more governments, parties, and leaders come to imitate the madman strategy, the scope for agreement in any negotiation will narrow, and will become more likely.
In fact, hardline German economists have already responded to Italy’s political crisis by circulating petitions to block any eurozone reform that could be regarded as a concession.
But exposing the dangers of the madman strategy will not be enough to defeat it.
Voters also must be convinced that better alternatives are available, and that European integration can still safeguard their interests.
In the months before Italy’s next election and the EU parliamentary elections in May 2019, EU leaders will have some – but not much – time to show that European integration is about more than political paralysis and economic stagnation.
Otherwise, we might soon be reacquainted with the madman strategy’s grim side.
Before his abdication in 1918, German Kaiser Wilhelm II did not need to pretend to be unstable; he really was.
With a penchant for saber-rattling speeches and outrageous newspaper interviews, he had something in common with America’s Tweeter-in-Chief.
In another disturbing historical parallel, he often boasted about his ability to reach agreements with the Russian and British monarchs, to whom he was related.
In the event, as the crisis of diplomacy was escalating in July 1914, he suddenly announced a grand new peace initiative.
But it was too late.
The game of chicken had spread, and the world’s leading powers hurtled together toward catastrophe.

The Geopolitics of Holocaust Memory
PARIS – The 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by the Red Army is an occasion marked by angst as well as sadness.
Anti-Semitism is back with a vengeance around the world, as if the lessons of the Holocaust had evaporated with time – or, even worse, had never been fully integrated into our collective consciousness.
This unprecedented crime, perpetrated by one of the most advanced and cultivated societies on Earth, was the most extreme example of the horrors humans can inflict on one another.
When pushed by a combination of fear and hatred, people can become monsters.
The current resurgence of populism and nationalism makes it all the more important to commemorate the victims of Auschwitz.
But, 75 years on, the duty to remember is doubly threatened: by the political instrumentalization of the Holocaust, and by the natural human proclivity to forget the past or become indifferent to the suffering of others.
More than ever, we are witnessing what could be called the geopolitics of Holocaust memory.
Five years ago, in 2015, the only commemoration of the camp’s liberation took place in situ at Auschwitz, under the aegis of the Polish government.
(In the immediate aftermath of Russia’s seizure of Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited to address the gathering.)
This year, however, there has been a competition between two commemorations: one in Jerusalem at the behest of the Israeli government and the European Jewish Congress, and the other, sought by the Polish government, at Auschwitz.
Poland, where the horror took place, sent no delegate to the Jerusalem ceremony, after its president, Andrzej Duda, refused to attend.
Duda had not been invited to speak at the event, whereas Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Britain’s Prince Charles were.
Having to choose between Russia and Poland, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu did not hesitate – even though Russia now considers World War II to have started in 1941 instead of 1939, when the Soviet Union seized Polish territory under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany.
Poland’s increasingly nationalistic treatment of history in recent years also no doubt influenced Netanyahu’s decision.
The Jerusalem commemoration represented an undeniable diplomatic victory for Israel.
Not since the 1995 funeral of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had so many world leaders gathered in the city.
But the event also constituted a success for Russia, with Putin’s presence confirming his country’s new indispensable status in the Middle East.
With the passage of time, the real heroes of the Auschwitz commemorations are becoming ever fewer.
But they are in no position to resist this instrumentalization of their suffering.
Of course, instrumentalizing the memory of the Holocaust is nothing new.
During the Cold War, Eastern and Central Europe’s communist regimes emphasized the crimes that had been committed by fascists against anti-fascist patriots, thereby relativizing or even denying the Jewish origin of the overwhelming majority of the victims.
Today, with the rise of populism, any sort of criticisms of “local populations,” or of their “complicity” in the crimes committed by Nazi Germany, have become punishable offenses – starting in Poland.
This approach shows no respect for historical truth – and often contradicts it.
It suits people who also have suffered deeply, but do not want to confront their responsibility for the suffering of others.
Since Netanyahu has been prime minister, the instrumentalization of the memory of the Holocaust has played a central role in Israeli diplomacy as well, while the Iranian regime, with its repeated calls for Israel’s destruction, seems to be doing its best to encourage such a stance.
The memory of the past is threatened not only by its instrumentalization, but also by a powerful combination of ignorance and forgetfulness, not to mention the Holocaust-denial camp.
One-fifth of young people in France under the age of 24 have no idea what the Holocaust was.
And the ignorance of some feeds the fear of others: polls indicate that 34% of French Jews feel threatened in their country.
Tackling this problem is above all a question of education.
But there is a broader issue as well, namely the contrast among young people between their legitimate preoccupation with the planet and their lack of interest in politics.
The young climate activist Greta Thunberg, for example, has helped to mobilize millions of people.
But how can we convince them that ecological awareness is not a substitute for concern about freedom and democracy, but rather complementary to it?
The memory of the Holocaust should be seen as a kind of ultimate bulwark against the politics of hatred at a time when democracy and its institutions are being eroded.
But it is not easy to defend the principle of “never again” when social networks are spreading so much atavism and ignorance.
Immediately before the Jerusalem events, I was in Berlin, the city where the “Final Solution” was conceived.
When the rebuilding of the Stadtschloss (city palace) is complete, it will house the Humboldt Forum, a cultural center named in honor of brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who embodied the Enlightenment spirit.
It has taken 75 years to erase the physical traces of Hitler’s genocidal folly.
Is that the time it also takes to forget the lessons of history?
I have recently been wondering what my father, prisoner number 159721 at Auschwitz, would have made of these 75th anniversary commemorations.
He probably would have felt pride at not being forgotten, and sadness at how the Holocaust has become an event to be “spun” for political gain in a world that has learned virtually nothing.

Capitalism's High Noon
Europe's Enron-induced schadenfreude is kaput.
Last year's Vivendi and this year's Parmalat scandals have seen to that.
Europe, like America - indeed, like the entire capitalist world - must now become more hawkish in demanding prosecution and punishment of bosses who loot their companies.
American prosecutors in the Enron case have made important progress lately, with some important crooks, like Andrew Fastow, offering both guilty pleas and a willingness to testify against their former colleagues.
Mr. Fastow will go to jail for ten years; those he testifies against will face even longer sentences.
Italian prosecutors seem zealous to make those who looted Parmalat pay a similar price.
But these cases go beyond the companies robbed and the shareholders betrayed.
What is at stake is no less than the perception of the fairness of the market and political support everywhere for market-oriented policies.
Capitalist economies produce inequality, often large ones.
Up to a point, and to the extent that income differences are due to differences in ability, effort, investment in education, etc., they are necessary to providing the correct incentives to invest, work, innovate, and grow.
But the more tainted the market's reputation for fairness, the more average citizens will see income differences merely as the result of corruption, illegal activities, connections with public officials, and so on.
This will increase demands for more regulation and heavy government involvement in the economy, so as to bring unruly and untrustworthy capitalists under greater control.
Moreover, the more that wealth accumulation is viewed as "unfair" (i.e., the result of corruption and illegality), the more pressure for stiff taxation of "ill-gotten gains" will mount.
If any of these populist measures would make markets fairer and better functioning, we would say, "So be it."
Unfortunately, reacting to corrupt businessmen in this way sets in motion a vicious circle: more regulation may lead to even more corruption in order to avoid it; higher taxes on wealth will bring about even more tax evasion, making the system even more tainted.
Sadly, nowadays, things as disparate as highly paid executives, the Enron and Parmalat scandals, contested mergers and acquisitions, stock market volatility, "junk bonds," and asset-price bubbles are all lumped together under the snide heading "cowboy capitalism."
Europeans are particularly prone to see things this way - and to see a powerful government as the sheriff to keep the cowboys from shooting up the town.
This is especially worrisome because Europe has recently begun moving in the right direction by deregulating its markets.
With political support for these changes still shaky, the risk is that opponents may use Parmalat, Enron, Vivendi, and other cases as an excuse to reverse the process.
In many developing countries, weak regulators and a widespread perception of corruption often stand in the way of pro-market reforms; the left (populist or otherwise) can credibly argue that capitalism is "corrupt" and so must be taken under the wing of the government.
This is a big reason why market capitalism has such a hard time taking root in the developing word.
If capitalists are corrupt, how can you convince a poor peasant to believe in the market economy?
He will vote for populist policies.
The result is even more corruption and less growth in a sort of "corruption-induced" poverty trap.
The Parmalat scandal may have been a blow to global capitalism, but in Italy it is hoped that it might sound the death knell for an economic system traditionally based much more on "connections" amongst private groups - and between these groups and the public sector - than on competitive markets.
For Italy, the obvious solution is to strengthen the country's investigative and financial institutions, and improve the design of regulatory agencies, particularly the quality of their personnel.
This, however, will not happen overnight, and in the meantime the demand for more regulation may result in a structure that is heavy, ineffective, and in the end impedes, rather than corrects, market forces.
Supervision inside Italian firms should be strengthened by making sure that a sufficient number of non-executive directors sit on the boards of public companies.
A single independent director would probably have been enough to blow the whistle at Parmalat: there were none on its board.
Similarly, it might help to have accounting firms be selected by minority shareholders or paid by the stock exchange, rather than by a company itself.
Here, even the recent changes in the US have not gone far enough: they prevent accounting firms from also serving as advisors to a firm, but they still leave the decision about remunerating the accountants in the hands of the company, thus creating a perverse incentive to play fast and loose with financial reporting.
It is surprising that while the Italian government is busy redesigning the regulatory and supervisory structure of the country's financial institutions and financial markets, nothing is being said about independent directors and accounting firms.
After all, good sheriffs need active citizens to be in their posses and to serve on juries.
Clean capitalism needs the same sort of widespread engagement.

A Human Rights Court for Africa
One crucial insight to be gained from a century of establishing international courts and tribunals is that while momentum is vital, getting things right from the start is equally important.
With little fanfare, January 25, 2004, marked a milestone in the history of the protection of human rights in Africa: the entry into force of the Protocol for establishing an African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights.
After Europe and the Americas, Africa will be the third continent with a regional court to redress human rights violations.
Acceptance of the Protocol in the last year by such influential African countries as Algeria, South Africa, and Libya gave the final and sudden impetus to the Court's establishment, and the critical threshold of fifteen ratifications was reached shortly before the New Year, when the Comoros signed on.
But it is in countries like Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Rwanda, and Uganda, which have all ratified the Protocol, that the Court will likely play a major role in checking human rights abuses.
It can do so because the Court's judgments will be legally binding and thus enforceable in national courts.
In states that accepted the Court's jurisdiction, individuals will be able to gain access to the Court directly, even to file cases against their own governments.
African NGO's will be able to ask the Court for advisory opinions, thus strengthening the effectiveness of the African human rights regime.
Clearly, the birth of an African human rights court should be celebrated.
But it risks foundering in the docks, and its launch should therefore be deliberate, not rushed.
The process is now progressing at a startling - and worrying - pace.
Nominations for the first judges have been requested by the end of April, with the aim of holding elections at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa on July 5-7.
Experience elsewhere suggests that once judges have been appointed, rules of procedure drafted and adopted, and the relationship with other international organs shaped, the system will become fixed.
Whatever faults and shortcomings are built in at the beginning will become locked in.
But building a sound international judicial body cannot be rushed; it requires time and resources - both human and financial - and a lot of support.
It took more than four years to physically establish the International Criminal Court, and it took a massive effort by the United Nations, several major countries, and hundreds of experts, NGO's, and think tanks to get this done.
Admittedly, sometimes time is a luxury.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR) opened for work in less than a year in order to begin addressing heinous crimes that were ongoing.
But the price of that rush job is evident: as cases started flowing in, the courts' governing statute and rules of procedure and evidence had to be patched on the fly.
The statute of the ICTY has been amended four times and the rules of procedure and evidence no less than twenty-seven times.
Figures for the ICTR are only slightly better.
That is a poor record for any court of law, which should afford defendants certainty and procedural fairness.
All this tinkering could be done because there was an extraordinary consensus in the UN Security Council on the need not to delay the trials.
But such agreement is extraordinary.
For courts established by treaty, like the African Court, it will likely prove very hard, if not impossible, to find the majority necessary to support changes.
Moreover, effective courts must be politically independent.
But this can be achieved only if the right conditions are in place from the onset.
The process for nominating judges at the national level is critical.
Candidates who are adequate - and who are widely seen to be adequate - are the key to the Court's legitimacy.
In the European human rights system, the nominating process involves civil society and severe scrutiny by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
It is only through an open, transparent process that the best candidates - those who give the greatest guarantees of independence - can be identified.
But that takes time.
Moreover, the first bench of any international court is critically important, because it is entrusted to prepare and adopt other key documents - such as the rules of procedure, internal regulations, and financial regulations - that will govern the court for years to come.
When they meet in July in Addis Ababa, African heads of state would be better off discussing where the court will be located, how it will be financed, and, most importantly, agreeing standards for an open, participatory, and transparent process for electing its judges.
They should not rush into nominating judges for a court that is still largely on the drawing board.
Africa is poised to establish its own human rights tribunal, fifty years after Europe, 25 years after the Americas, and two years after the International Criminal Court.
But, above all, Africa needs a human rights court that commands the unreserved and unmitigated respect of the continent's governments and peoples.
Africa's leaders should take a few more months to do it right.

Paths to Sustainable Power
NEW YORK – The surest bet on the future of energy is the need for low-carbon energy supplies.
Around 80% of the world’s primary energy today is carbon based: coal, oil, and gas.
We will need to shift to no- or low-carbon energy by mid-century.
The big questions are how and when.
Low-carbon primary energy means three options: renewable energy, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass; nuclear energy; and carbon capture and sequestration, which means using fossil fuels to create energy, but trapping the CO2 emissions that result and storing the carbon safely underground.
There are three compelling reasons for the world to make the shift to low-carbon energy.
First, higher levels of CO2 are making the world’s oceans acidic.
If we continue with business as usual, we will end up destroying a vast amount of marine life, severely damaging the food chains on which we rely.
Second, CO2 is dangerously changing the world’s climate, even if many Big Oil interests would have us believe otherwise. (So, too, did the tobacco companies spend vast sums on political lobbying and bogus science to deny the links between smoking and lung cancer.)
Third, we face steeply rising prices for fossil fuels, as developing countries’ growth drives up demand and conventional supplies of coal, oil, and gas are depleted.
Sure, we can find more fossil fuels, but at much higher cost and at much greater environmental risk from industrial spills, waste products, leaks, and other damage.
Even the much-heralded shale-gas revolution is a lot of hype – similar to the gold rushes and stock bubbles of the past.
Shale-gas wells deplete far more rapidly than conventional fields do. And they are environmentally dirty to boot.
The United States has developed many new low-carbon energy technologies, but other countries are currently far more intent, far-sighted, and decisive than the US to put these technologies to large-scale use.
Politically, America is still the land of Big Oil.
Americans are bombarded by industry-funded media downplaying climate change, while countries that are much poorer in fossil fuels are already making the necessary transition to a low-carbon future.
Two neighbors in Europe, Germany and France, are showing the way forward – or, more precisely, the alternative ways forward – to a low-carbon future.
They are going about it in ways that reflect their different resource endowments, industrial histories, and political pressures.
Germany is undertaking the Energiewende, or transition to sustainable energy – a remarkable effort (indeed, unprecedented for a large advanced economy) to meet the country’s entire energy demand with renewable energy, especially solar and wind power.
Meanwhile, France relies heavily on low-carbon nuclear power, and is switching rapidly to electric vehicles, such as the pioneering Renault-Nissan Leaf.
Of the two approaches, Germany’s is the more unusual bet.
After Japan’s nuclear disaster at Fukushima, Germany decided to shut down its entire nuclear power industry and shift entirely to a strategy based on greater energy efficiency (lower energy input per unit of national income) and renewables.
There really is no clear roadmap for such a huge energy transformation, and Germany almost surely will need to rely on a European-wide electricity grid to share clean energy, and eventually on imported solar power from North Africa and the Middle East.
France’s bet on nuclear power is a more proven option.
After all, most of France’s electricity has come from nuclear power for many years.
And, though anti-nuclear sentiment is very strong in Europe – and, increasingly, even in France – nuclear power will remain part of the global energy mix for decades to come, simply because much of Asia (including China, India, South Korea, and Japan) will remain major users of it.
The key point is that France and Germany, and many other European countries – including the Scandinavian countries, with their considerable wind and hydropower potential – are all recognizing that the world as a whole will have to move away from a fossil-fuel-based energy system.
That is the right calculation.
Many will no doubt argue about which alternative – France’s bet on nuclear power or Germany’s solar pathway – is wiser.
But both strategies are probably correct.
Most studies show that deep de-carbonization of the world economy from now to mid-century, a time horizon mandated by environmental realities, will require that all low-carbon options – including greater efficiency and renewables – be scaled up massively.
One of the highest priorities of the new Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which I direct on behalf of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, will be to elaborate alternative pathways to a low-carbon economy, taking into account the specific conditions of countries around the world.
Different countries will choose different strategies, but we will all need to get to the same place: a new energy system built on low-carbon sources, electrification of vehicles, and smart, energy-efficient buildings and cities.
Early movers may pay a slightly higher price today for these strategies, but they and the world will reap long-term economic and environmental benefits.
By embracing truly sustainable technologies, France, Germany, and others are creating the energy system that will increasingly support the world economy throughout this century.

Does “Curing” Cancer Kill Patients?
TAMPA – Patients and politicians increasingly demand a “cure” for cancer.
But controlling the disease may prove to be a better strategy than striving to cure it.
A century ago, the German Nobel laureate Paul Ehrlich introduced the concept of “magic bullets” – compounds engineered to target and kill tumor cells or disease-causing organisms without affecting normal cells. The success of antibiotics 50 years later seemed to validate Ehrlich’s idea.
Yet lessons learned in dealing with exotic species, combined with recent mathematical models of the evolutionary dynamics of tumors, indicate that eradicating most cancers may be impossible.
Trying to do so, moreover, could worsen the problem.
In 1854, the year Ehrlich was born, the diamondback moth was first observed in Illinois.
Within five decades, the moth had spread throughout North America.
It now infests the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
Attempts to eradicate it using chemicals worked only fleetingly.
In the late 1980’s, biologists found strains that were resistant to all known insecticides.
So farmers abandoned their efforts to eliminate the moth.
Instead, most now apply insecticides only when infestation exceeds some threshold level, with the goal of producing a sustainable and satisfactory crop.
Under the banner of “integrated pest management,” hundreds of invasive species are now successfully controlled by strategies that restrict the population growth of pests but do not attempt to eradicate them
The ability of tumor cells to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, including toxic chemicals, is similar to the evolutionary capacities demonstrated by crop pests and other invasive species.
As in the case of the Diamondback moth, successful eradication of disseminated cancer cells is rare.
But despite the paucity of success, the typical goal in cancer therapy remains similar to that of antimicrobial treatments – killing as many tumor cells as possible under the assumption that this will, at best, cure the disease and, at worst, keep the patient alive for as long as possible.
Some types of cancer – for example, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, testicular cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia – can be consistently cured using aggressive chemotherapy.
But these malignant cells seem to be particularly responsive to “treatment.”
Just as invasive species adapt to pesticides, most cancer cells adapt to therapies.
Indeed, the parallels between cancerous cells and invasive species suggest that the principles for successful cancer therapy might be found not in the magic bullets of microbiology but in the evolutionary dynamics of applied ecology.
Recent research suggests that efforts to eliminate cancers may actually hasten the emergence of resistance and tumor recurrence, thus reducing a patient’s chances of survival.
The reason arises from a component of tumor biology not ordinarily investigated: the cost of resistance to treatment.
Cancer cells pay a price when they evolve resistance to chemotherapy.
For example, to cope with toxic drugs, a cancer cell may increase its rate of DNA repair, or actively pump the drug out across the cell membrane. In targeted therapies, in which drugs interfere with the molecular signaling needed for proliferation and survival, a cell might adapt by activating or following alternative pathways.
All these strategies use up energy that would otherwise be available for invasion into non-cancerous tissues or proliferation, and so reduce a cell’s fitness.
The more complex and costly the mechanisms used, the less fit the resistant population will be.
That cancer cells pay a price for resistance is supported by several observations. Cells in laboratory cultures that are resistant to chemotherapies typically lose their resistance when the chemicals are removed.
Lung cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy gemcitabine are less proliferative, invasive, and motile than their drug-sensitive counterparts.
Although resistant forms are commonly found in tumors that haven’t yet been exposed to treatment, they generally occur in small numbers.
This suggests that resistant cells are not so unfit that drug-sensitive cells completely out-competed them, but that they struggle to proliferate when both types are present.
Our models show that in the absence of therapy, cancer cells that haven’t evolved resistance will proliferate at the expense of the less-fit resistant cells.
When a large number of sensitive cells are killed, say, by aggressive therapies, resistant types can proliferate unconstrained. This means that high doses of chemotherapy might actually increase the likelihood of a tumor becoming unresponsive to further therapy.
So, just as judicious use of pesticides can control invasive species, a therapeutic strategy designed to maintain a stable, tolerable tumor volume could improve a patient’s prospects for survival by allowing sensitive cells to suppress the growth of resistant ones.
To test this idea, we treated a human ovarian cancer, grown in mice, with conventional high-dose chemotherapy.
The cancer rapidly regressed but then recurred and killed the mice.
Yet when we treated the mice with a drug dose continuously adjusted to maintain a stable tumor volume, the animals, though not cured, survived for a prolonged period of time.
Designing therapies to sustain a stable tumor mass rather than eradicate all cancer cells will require a strategy that looks beyond the immediate cytotoxic effects of any one treatment.
Researchers will need to establish the mechanisms by which cancer cells achieve resistance and what it costs them.
They will need to understand the evolutionary dynamics of resistant populations, and design strategies to suppress or exploit the adapted characteristics.
Of course, cancer researchers should not abandon their search for ever-more-effective cancer therapies, even for cures.
But it may be time to temper our quest for magic bullets and recognize the cold reality of Darwin’s evolutionary dynamics. Medicine’s goal of a glorious victory over cancer may need to yield to our recognizing that an uneasy stalemate may be the best that can be achieved.

What Does America Want?
When the leaders of the world's richest nations gather in Evian, France, one unasked question will dominate: what does America want in the world?
So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy.
First, inconsistency is no vice.
Indeed, in foreign policymaking, inconsistency is often a virtue.
I speak not of principles, but of policy.
The US does not have a "one size fits all" approach to the world.
What happened in Iraq should not be over‑interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction, support terrorism, or deny people liberty.
In Iraq, the US used force as a last resort, against a country with a clear record of aggression, and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do.
Different policies-tailored for local, regional, and international realities-will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, or elsewhere.
America's armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally.
But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy.
Not every threat to America's national interests can be addressed with military power.
If all you have to work with is a hammer, as the saying goes, every problem looks like a nail.
Success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, requires the right tools for the job.
Partnership is essential here.
For all of America's power, there is little that the US can do in the world that it can't do better with the active participation of others, be they governments, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations.
Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared.
America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism: foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks.
Beyond partnerships, international institutions add value-provided they are effectively organized, have realistic mandates, and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims.
Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests.
Indeed, it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy-from trade to non‑proliferation to environmental policy-without them.
The World Trade Organization is a case in point.
It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements, seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies, and resolve disputes with trading partners.
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.
NATO, for example, is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today's security challenges wherever they may arise, such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq.
Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values.
The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals.
When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats, America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible, ad hoc coalitions of the willing.
Not even the UN has a monopoly on legitimacy, which depends most on an action's rationale and the manner in which it is undertaken.
This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon.
We ignore failing states at our peril, because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists, criminals, and drug traffickers.
One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states.
Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery.
One impulse behind America's international engagement, and one of the great sources of its global power, has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place.
Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values, because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals.
The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America's political institutions, society, and culture, and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy.
At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests, owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably.
Today's world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and the US.
This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all.
Our over‑riding goal should be to create a world in which governments, organizations, and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values.
Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort, terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale, weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, free trade becomes the norm, citizens enjoy basic liberties, democratic values triumph, and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun.
Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic, even idealistic, but it is hardly naive.

The Trans-Pacific Free-Trade Charade
NEW YORK – As negotiators and ministers from the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries meet in Atlanta in an effort to finalize the details of the sweeping new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), some sober analysis is warranted.
The biggest regional trade and investment agreement in history is not what it seems.
You will hear much about the importance of the TPP for “free trade.”
The reality is that this is an agreement to manage its members’ trade and investment relations – and to do so on behalf of each country’s most powerful business lobbies.
Make no mistake: It is evident from the main outstanding issues, over which negotiators are still haggling, that the TPP is not about “free” trade.
New Zealand has threatened to walk away from the agreement over the way Canada and the US manage trade in dairy products.
Australia is not happy with how the US and Mexico manage trade in sugar.
And the US is not happy with how Japan manages trade in rice.
These industries are backed by significant voting blocs in their respective countries.
And they represent just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how the TPP would advance an agenda that actually runs counter to free trade.
For starters, consider what the agreement would do to expand intellectual property rights for big pharmaceutical companies, as we learned from leaked versions of the negotiating text.
Economic research clearly shows the argument that such intellectual property rights promote research to be weak at best.
In fact, there is evidence to the contrary: When the Supreme Court invalidated Myriad’s patent on the BRCA gene, it led to a burst of innovation that resulted in better tests at lower costs.
Indeed, provisions in the TPP would restrain open competition and raise prices for consumers in the US and around the world – anathema to free trade.
The TPP would manage trade in pharmaceuticals through a variety of seemingly arcane rule changes on issues such as “patent linkage,” “data exclusivity,” and “biologics.”
The upshot is that pharmaceutical companies would effectively be allowed to extend – sometimes almost indefinitely – their monopolies on patented medicines, keep cheaper generics off the market, and block “biosimilar” competitors from introducing new medicines for years.
That is how the TPP will manage trade for the pharmaceutical industry if the US gets its way.
Similarly, consider how the US hopes to use the TPP to manage trade for the tobacco industry.
For decades, US-based tobacco companies have used foreign investor adjudication mechanisms created by agreements like the TPP to fight regulations intended to curb the public-health scourge of smoking.
Under these investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) systems, foreign investors gain new rights to sue national governments in binding private arbitration for regulations they see as diminishing the expected profitability of their investments.
International corporate interests tout ISDS as necessary to protect property rights where the rule of law and credible courts are lacking.
But that argument is nonsense.
The US is seeking the same mechanism in a similar mega-deal with the European Union, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, even though there is little question about the quality of Europe’s legal and judicial systems.
To be sure, investors – wherever they call home – deserve protection from expropriation or discriminatory regulations.
But ISDS goes much further: The obligation to compensate investors for losses of expected profits can and has been applied even where rules are nondiscriminatory and profits are made from causing public harm.
Philip Morris International is currently prosecuting such cases against Australia and Uruguay (not a TPP partner) for requiring cigarettes to carry warning labels.
Canada, under threat of a similar suit, backed down from introducing a similarly effective warning label a few years back.
Given the veil of secrecy surrounding the TPP negotiations, it is not clear whether tobacco will be excluded from some aspects of ISDS.
Either way, the broader issue remains: Such provisions make it hard for governments to conduct their basic functions – protecting their citizens’ health and safety, ensuring economic stability, and safeguarding the environment.
Imagine what would have happened if these provisions had been in place when the lethal effects of asbestos were discovered.
Rather than shutting down manufacturers and forcing them to compensate those who had been harmed, under ISDS, governments would have had to pay the manufacturers not to kill their citizens.
Taxpayers would have been hit twice – first to pay for the health damage caused by asbestos, and then to compensate manufacturers for their lost profits when the government stepped in to regulate a dangerous product.
It should surprise no one that America’s international agreements produce managed rather than free trade.
That is what happens when the policymaking process is closed to non-business stakeholders – not to mention the people’s elected representatives in Congress.

Supporting Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research
Most of the cells in our bodies have a short life span and a specific job to do.
Stem cells, found in many organs from skin to bone marrow, are different.
The “ancestors” of ordinary cells, they can replenish themselves indefinitely.
Given the right biochemical signals, these cells can divide and transform themselves into a range of different cell types as and when the need arises.
Such versatility means that stem cells have the potential to regenerate damaged organ tissues and provide amazing new treatments for a range of now devastating diseases.
Indeed, stem cells may perhaps make it possible for humans to “grow new organs” to replace diseased ones, thereby providing for the possibility of new forms of cell-based therapies.
On the basis of research with comparable cells from mice, scientists envision that stem cells could be used to replace bone marrow in patients suffering from cancer, produce pancreatic cells for alleviating diabetes, or neuronal cells for treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various brain and spinal cord disorders.
Stem cells used in this research are best derived from very early stage embryos created by in vitro fertilization, but this leads to ethical dilemmas.
The idea that human embryos could be created with the express purpose of “harvesting” them for medical purposes incites fear of a “brave new world” revisited.
Even if that extreme is unlikely, the possibility of abuse of any sort generates strong opposition.
Most of those who oppose stem cell research do not question its scientific and medical value, but object to the use of human embryos.
These critics, especially in Germany, where stem cell research evokes nightmares of Nazi era eugenics, argue that research with stem cells derived from embryos is unnecessary because multi-potential stem cells occur naturally in adult tissues as well.
While guardedly encouraged by recent reports of the remarkable plasticity of stem cells obtained from adult tissues, scientists know little about their potential for prolonged maintenance outside the body, their capacity for differentiation, and whether they can be obtained in the quantities needed to explore their utility for clinical use.
If embryonic stem cell research were to be halted based on that hope, it is possible that years may pass before scientists could determine if adult-derived stem cells are equivalent to embryonic stem cells in their potential to treat disease.
We cannot afford the luxury of proceeding with these promising technologies sequentially.
We owe it to those who are in need to explore all possible avenues that could lead to medical cures.
While research on adult-derived stem cells should be pursued aggressively, it should not be at the expense of an aggressive program to explore the full potential of stem cells for use in human therapies.
Another restriction has been recently adopted in the United States, where the issue was explored by the National Biomedical Ethics Advisory Commission in extensive hearings and discussions with ethicists, religious leaders, scientists and physicians.
They concluded that it is ethically permissible to prepare stem cell lines from frozen embryos, but only from those obtained in the course of in vitro fertilization procedures and deemed by donors and their physician to be in excess of clinical requirements.
(More eggs are usually fertilized than are actually implanted in women who want to become pregnant.)
Following these discussions, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) promulgated guidelines that allow the use of government funds for stem-cell research but, in their present form, prohibit federally-funded investigators from creating new stem cell lines.
That restriction requires that stem cell lines must be obtained only from privately-funded or commercial sources that follow the protocols mandated by the guidelines.
I believe that restricting the use of government funds for the creation of stem cells, although politically prudent, imposes substantial scientific handicaps.
We know that a variety of poorly understood factors cause embryonic stem cells to lose their capacity to differentiate into all possible cell types.
This loss of capacity to differentiate may be caused by the particular mode in which the stem cells are derived, the conditions surrounding their growth, and other variables of handling.
Enabling individual government-funded investigators to derive stem cell lines using a variety of conditions in their own laboratories, as permitted recently in Britain and France, is the best route to determining what conditions are critical for generating cells for specific therapeutic purposes.
Embryonic stem cells prepared in a scientist’s own laboratory are most likely to have been derived, stored and maintained in ways that maximize their potency for particular uses.
Cells obtained from commercial sources are likely to be of unknown genetic background and history and therefore be less useful for some important studies.
While various remote contingencies are sometimes invoked, the fundamental ethical choice posed by stem cell research is more circumscribed: whether human embryos, which will ultimately be legally discarded, should be used to create potentially life-saving therapies for those in need.
Those who oppose abortion irrespective of its purpose argue that sacrificing a human embryo to obtain stem cells is akin to abortion and therefore immoral.
But harvesting stem cells from very early stage embryos that will in the end be discarded is, in my view, ethically distinct from abortion.
For we must also consider the moral consequences of failing to pursue this line of research if it has the potential to save and improve human lives.
What greater morality exists than doing all we can do to help individuals whose lives are blighted by disease and disability?

The Last Interventionist
When Tony Blair, having procrastinated about his departure almost to the point of unreason, finally gives up the British premiership this month, it will be to the general relief not only of the British public as a whole, but also of the overwhelming majority of his own party.
After three terms in office, it could hardly be otherwise.
Despite the cliché, power does corrupt, and the late Blair era, like that of Margaret Thatcher before it, has been a squalid spectacle.
The paradox is that, for a man who wielded so much power for so long, it is unclear what domestic legacy, if any, Blair will leave.
Blairism was a mood, a style, but, in substantive terms, it represented no radical break with the Thatcherite legacy that New Labour repackaged so cleverly, and, in fairness, administered more humanely than the Iron Lady ever did.
Foreign policy is another story.
Whatever one thinks of him, in international affairs Blair was a leader of consequence.
Indeed, he can be plausibly described as being chiefly responsible for formulating and successfully propagating the doctrine of “humanitarian intervention.”
That idea captured the imagination of much of the elite of the developed world over the course of the 1990’s, and provided the moral rationale for the principal Western military interventions of the post-Cold War period, from Bosnia to Iraq.
Given how catastrophic the invasion of Iraq has turned out to be, it is hard even to remember when interventions on moral grounds – whether to thwart a dictator, as in the case of the Balkan wars, or to put an end to anarchic cruelty, as in the case of British intervention in Sierra Leone – seemed like a great advance in international affairs.
No longer would the powerful sit by idly while butchers like Slobodan Milosevic or Foday Sankoh slaughtered their own people.
Today, humanitarian intervention has become a dirty word for many of the same people who once believed in it.
Only American neo-conservatives, understandably grateful for his championing of the Iraq war and his ability to argue for it coherently and eloquently (unlike President Bush, who was and is unable to do either), are sorry to see Blair go.
But what may be lost is how many people did believe.
Blair still does.
In a recent interview, he replied to the question of the core of his foreign policy with two words: “liberal interventionism.”
The world may have moved on, chastened by the realization that interveners, even when intervening in the name of human rights, can be as barbaric as tin pot dictators.
But Blair, it seems, is not to be moved.
What was famously said of Thatcher – “the lady’s not for turning” – can be said of him as well.
In fairness to Blair, this is not mere stubbornness, as it seems to the case with Bush and his current and erstwhile minions, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and, of course, Vice President Dick Cheney.
For Blair, there is a moral unity between the interventions in Kosovo and Iraq, both of which he presents as examples of a post-Westphalian idea that powerful states are called upon to defend suffering communities globally, including by military means.
To the charge that this idea is actually old-fashioned liberal imperialism updated for the post-Cold War world, Blair has consistently replied that what he called for in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and Iraq are wars of “values, not interests.”
In his more petulant moments, he has asked why so many of those who saw no harm in NATO undermining Milosevic adamantly opposed the ouster of Saddam Hussein.
Actually, the answer is quite simple.
Blair’s vision of wars of values rather than interests has increasingly come to seem like a moral flag of convenience – in a way similar to the use of human rights by the rich world’s governments to justify their continued domination of institutions like the World Bank and the IMF.
The fact that NATO now considers its area of operations to legitimately extend all the way to the Hindu Kush has given pause even to many who once believed as fervently in humanitarian intervention as Blair still does.
Of course, Blair does not think of himself as a new imperialist.
On the contrary, as he has frequently made clear, he considers his critics immoral for not supporting liberal interventions.
But nor did nineteenth-century colonialists think of themselves as immoral.
Indeed, perhaps the greatest of British imperial conquerors in Africa, Cecil Rhodes, once defined imperialism as “philanthropy plus 5%.”
Take that, Dick Cheney and Halliburton.
Doubtless, we will learn more about Blair’s justifications for what he did, and further articulations of his interventionist creed, when he goes on the lecture circuit and, in due course, publishes his memoirs.
The pathos of his situation, though, is that no one is listening anymore.
Blair is the last interventionist.
Neither his successor, Gordon Brown, nor George W. Bush’s successor, whoever he or she turns out to be, will be able to mount another intervention similar to that in Kosovo, let alone Iraq.
Those pressing for military intervention in Darfur would probably say that this is a bad thing.
But, as they rail against the failure of the West to take action, they should remember why such action is impossible.
By putting liberal interventionism at the heart of his foreign policy, Tony Blair has made it radioactive – a political non-starter for at least a generation.

Does Growth Have a Future?
MILAN – What can we expect as the world’s economy emerges from its most serious downturn in almost a century?
The short answer is a “new normal,” with slower growth, a de-risked and more stable core financial system, and a set of additional challenges (energy, climate, and demographic imbalances, to name a few) with varying time horizons that will test our collective capacity to improve management and oversight of the global economy.
Lower growth is the best guess for the medium term.
It seems most likely, but no one really knows.
The financial crisis, morphing quickly into a global economic downturn, resulted not just from a failure to react to growing instability, risk, and imbalance, but also from a widespread pre-crisis inability to ”see” the rising systemic risk.
These defining characteristics will condition the responses and the results in coming years.
There are countervailing forces.
The high-growth countries (China and India) are large and getting larger relative to the rest.
That alone will tend to elevate global growth compared to the world where industrial countries, and the US in particular, were in the growth driving seat.
The current crisis has come to be called a “balance-sheet recession” of global scope and tremendous depth and destructive power because of its origins in the balance sheets of the financial and household sectors.
Extreme balance-sheet destruction is what made it distinctive. In the future, central banks and regulators will not be able to afford a narrow focus on (goods and services) inflation, growth, and employment (the real economy) while letting the balance-sheet side fend for itself.
Somewhere in the system, accountability for stability and sustainability in terms of asset valuation, leverage, and balance sheets will need to be assigned and taken seriously.
Financial re-regulation should and will emphasize capital, reserve, and margin requirements; limiting systemic risk buildup by constraining leverage; eliminating fragmented and incomplete regulatory coverage and regulatory arbitrage (a huge challenge internationally); and a focus on transparency.
Isolating and further constraining a portion of the banking system, so that the channels of credit intermediation are less prone to complete and simultaneous breakdown, also seems likely.
Relative to the recent past, the cost of capital will increase, debt will be more expensive and less ubiquitous, and risk spreads will not return to pre-crisis compressed levels.
Assets bubbles will not disappear, but they will be less likely to be turbocharged by leverage.
American consumers will save more and spend less, abandoning the pattern of the last few years.
The large hole (on the order of $700 billion or more) in global aggregate demand will have to be filled over time by a compensating increase in consumption in surplus economies, such as China and Japan.
The longer this takes, the greater the incentives at the national level to capture a share of global demand via protectionist measures.
The recent increase in protectionist measures is an understandable political price for a range of stimulus packages in advanced and developing countries.
But such measures may increase – and will be harder to phase out over time – in the context of a shortfall in aggregate demand.
This is the forward-looking version of the global imbalance issue.
Its resolution via coordinated policy action (or a failure to resolve it through such action) will have a huge impact (for good or ill) on the multinational incentive structure surrounding the global economy – and hence on its likely growth.
Responsibility for overseeing the global economy is passing rapidly from the G-7/8 to the G-20, as it should.
The latter accounts for 90% of global GDP and two-thirds of the world’s population, so this shift is highly desirable – indeed, essential.
But there is a risk that the interests of the remaining one-third of the world’s people (and the majority of the small countries) will not be adequately represented as the international architecture for managing the global economy evolves.
In the current crisis, a substantial fraction of countries outside the G-20 are essentially defenseless: small relatively poor economies, no fiscal capacity for stimulus, and inadequate reserves to offset the capital outflows that occurred to shore up damaged balance sheets in advanced markets.
Within the G-20 countries, there are mechanisms that attend to the interests of the most vulnerable citizens.
In the global economy, the most vulnerable are whole countries.
Inattention to their interests is not just a moral issue, but a potentially explosive social and economic one.
As a result, the world’s international economic institutions will need to be strengthened in terms of governance and resources so that they can act as circuit-breakers in the event of future financial and economic turbulence.
Entering the crisis, the International Monetary Fund was underfunded, and it continues to lack credibility and trust in certain systemically important parts of the world.
It is now in the process of being better funded, but we are eight months into a crisis in which international capital flows became volatile and were driven largely by emergency responses rather than underlying economic fundamentals.
Thus, there remains the central question of trust and confidence in the system, which have been badly damaged and will take time to rebuild.
At the moment, the majority view in most countries is that the financial system failed badly, but that the incentives and dynamics of the broader market-based system in a relatively open global architecture remain the best avenues for wealth creation, poverty reduction, and the expansion of opportunity.
There are, of course, dissidents, and the balance could shift quickly.
It is not inconceivable that the baby will be thrown out with the bath water.
There is no magic bullet for today’s crisis.
Pragmatic, steady progress at the national and international levels in improving the regulatory architecture and increasing our collective ability to avoid non-cooperative behavior and suboptimal equilibria, is the best course to follow.
It is the course we are on.
But for now, it is a journey without a clearly defined, widely accepted endpoint.

America’s Anti-Immigrant Road Rage
Because Latin American countries enjoy the billions of dollars that their countrymen in the United States send home, they should take note of how many of their benefactors are being treated by American officials.
Despite their numbers – the Urban Institute estimates that more than nine million undocumented immigrants live in the US, a number that exceeds the entire populations of countries like Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the undocumented worker has long been North America’s favorite punching bag.
Damned on Sunday, they are hired for work on Monday.
Attacks on immigrants went into high gear in February, when the US Congress passed a bill that will make it illegal for any state to issue driver’s licenses to undocumented workers.
No one in America is even writing about this or taking much notice because few care about those who are in the US illegally.
Undocumented workers pick America’s crops, clean Americans’ houses, and serve Americans their food, but their fate simply does not matter to many US citizens.
Most groups with nine million members who represent billions of dollars would be raising hell in Congress if they were targeted for ill treatment.
But the money undocumented workers earn goes abroad to build homes, start businesses, and take care of elderly parents throughout Latin America.
So the countries that benefit from this largesse have a responsibility to speak up for the constituents who help keep their economies afloat.
US Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says that if foreign presidents don’t speak up for their constituents in America, few others will.
If California is any indicator, a ban on driver’s licenses won’t be effective in keeping undocumented workers off the road.
It will merely make life riskier and more expensive for them, pushing them even further to the margins of society.
Gil Cedillo, a California state senator who has been trying to reverse earlier legislation that in 1994 made it illegal for undocumented workers in California to drive, wrote in a recent policy paper, “While the number of immigrant drivers may be minimally reduced, most simply drive without being trained, tested, licensed, and insured.”
Unlicensed drivers, he found, are nearly five times more likely to be in a fatal crash.
In addition to all the deaths, the net result of this, Cedillo found, was that unlicensed drivers cost Californians some $831 million a year in uninsured motorist coverage.
In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles where undocumented immigrants are concentrated, roughly 90% of drivers are uninsured.
Immigrants need to get to work and so they buy, sell, drive, and abandon cars in a parallel market.
When I talked to immigrants in Oakland, they called their license “tu licencia con dios,” or “your license with God.”
A benevolent God keeps the immigrant from being stopped by the police.
Undocumented workers thus enter the cycle of those who live and drive with nearly throwaway cars that cost between $200 and $700.
When it breaks down, the car of an unlicensed driver is towed to a lot, where it is rarely claimed.
It is then put up for auction and repurchased by agents who in turn sell it to another unlicensed immigrant.
The trick for an immigrant is to always buy cheap, because he never knows how long it will be before a car breaks down.
It is time for Latin America’s leaders to stand up for citizens who mean so much for their countries’ economies.
For example, fighting the Congress’s proposed nationwide ban on driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants could be a high priority while negotiating new trade agreements with the US.
In any case, the time to act is now: once the ban is passed by Congress and signed by the president, it is unlikely to be lifted any time soon.
The California experience is a case in point.
Probably no other state governor has the political clout to win against the tide of activists who regard offering an undocumented immigrant a driver’s license as tantamount to offering them work, which they already have, and legitimacy, which they apparently don’t need to work.
While repealing one law to satisfy his voters – and get elected – Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger promised new legislation that would restore undocumented workers’ ability to obtain a driver’s license.
But the anti-immigrant vitriol of the 1990’s, which pushed California’s legislature to impose the ban, remains strong, and not even the immigrant Terminator can muster the courage to fight it.
Instead, Schwarzenegger, like other Americans, makes laws in the belief that nine million undocumented workers do not matter.

Abenomics’ Women Problem
TOKYO – When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the United Nations General Assembly last week, he emphasized his determination to build a society in which women shine.
Indeed, creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government’s reform program, so-called “Abenomics.”
Abe is clearly on the right track.
According to an analysis by researchers at Goldman Sachs, closing the gender gap could boost GDP by 9% in the United States and nearly 13% in Japan.
During his stay in New York, Abe also discussed “womenomics” with Hillary Clinton, who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her tenure as US Secretary of State.
Abe, strange to say, is the first Japanese leader to grasp that the underutilization of women’s skills has been holding back Japan’s economy.
Japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum’s “Global Gender Gap Report 2013,” down from 101st place in 2012.
The problem begins in Abe’s own domain – politics.
In his cabinet reshuffle earlier this month, five female ministers were appointed, but in the face of strong opposition from male MPs.
More important, the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks: Only 39 of the 480 members of the Japanese Diet’s lower house, or 7.9%, are women.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union ranks Japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female MPs.
Things are just as bad at lower levels of government, where women account for a mere 13.1% of representatives in local parliaments, more than 40% of which have no female members at all.
As the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next April’s local elections.
But, at least so far, Abe seems to lack the will to do so (though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women).
It is also worrying that some of the women Abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children.
Given this, one cannot help feeling uncertain about the credibility of his womenomics initiatives.
That is especially true when one considers the lack of women in corporate management positions.
Everyone at the meeting of the Keidanren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, to welcome US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy were men in dark suits.
In 2003, Norway revised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40% of management positions could face delisting.
If the same law were applied to Japan today, every company would be delisted.
Women currently hold an estimated 9% of senior management positions in Japan, compared to 40% in the Philippines, 24% in France, and 22% in the United States.
One reason that Japan’s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions, despite their varied experiences.
The exceptions are instructive.
When Akira Matsumoto became CEO of the Japanese snack manufacturer Calbee, he began appointing both female executives and foreigners to the company’s leadership.
Revenues and earnings have increased, and net sales have grown threefold.
Though there is no proof that the former caused the latter, Matsumoto’s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynamism may well increase with a more prominent role for women.
Likewise, Daiwa Securities CEO Shigeharu Suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities, with promising results.
Although the employment rate of women in Japan reached 69.5% in 2013, more than 60% of women leave the workplace prematurely, mostly owing to childbirth.
This pattern results from institutional impediments to achieving a viable work-family balance – impediments that embody the harsh view of male superiors and colleagues toward working mothers.
Changing this view is not easy, because the Confucian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in Japanese and some other Asian societies.
Moreover, most of the people participating in forums or workshops focused on womenomics are women; too often, these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves.
Abe’s womenomics will not work unless and until Japanese men change their thinking.
If Abenomics is now stalling, as many fear, the reason may be found in a lack of capacity to implement the policies put forward, particularly with respect to women.
Indeed, the key to Abenomics’ success or failure may turn out to be whether the Japanese people are convinced that women are essential to their country’s economic revival, and are willing to support an earnest effort to establish institutions that support working women.

Why Stop at the Russian Oligarchs?
ATHENS – No sooner had Roman Abramovich, newly targeted by the United Kingdom’s sanctions on Russian oligarchs, announced that he was selling Chelsea Football Club than the feeding frenzy began.
An athletics icon, City grandees, and even a respected Times columnist, each representing different American multi-billionaires, descended on London in a race to buy the club.
Meanwhile, a host of London properties belonging to Russian oligarchs entered a long-overdue process of liquidation.
What took so long?
To put it bluntly: the West’s legal foundations.
True, Western leaders encouraged the inflows.
David Cameron, then UK Prime Minister, appealed in 2011 to a Moscow audience to “invest” in Britain.
But it wasn’t hard to convince the oligarchs to flood London with their money.
Western countries’ legislation prevents governments and the public not only from disturbing wealth stored in their jurisdictions but also from even knowing where and how much of it there is.
Why else would countless corporations register in the US state of Delaware, using post office box addresses that guarantee their owners anonymity?
In fact, Western democracies grant foreign wealth even more protection from scrutiny.
In a 2021 report aptly titled “The UK’s Kleptocracy Problem,” the London-based think tank Chatham House revealed that the golden visas for sale to oligarchs from all over the world were granted after “checks … [that] were the sole responsibility of the law firms and wealth managers representing them.”
In my country, Greece, following our state’s effective bankruptcy in 2010, an oligarch could buy a no-questions-asked golden visa, which also came with a Schengen visa (and the opportunity to live and travel anywhere in the European Union), for a measly €250,000 ($276,000).
Similar visas are sold by other fiscally stressed eurozone countries, fueling a race to the bottom that the world’s oligarchs greatly appreciate.
While there is good reason to focus on Russian money, now that Russian bombs are destroying Ukrainian cities, it is puzzling that only Russian billionaires are called oligarchs.
Why is oligarchy, which means rule (arche) by the few (oligoi), considered an exclusively Russian phenomenon?
Are the Saudi or Emirati princes not oligarchic?
Do American billionaires, like those now flocking to buy Chelsea FC, smuggle less money out of their country than their Russian counterparts do, or have less political clout?
Do they use such power better than the Russians?
Russia’s wealthiest 0.01% (the top 1% of the top 1%) have taken about half their wealth, around $200 billion, out of Russia and stashed it in the UK and other havens.
At the same time, America’s wealthiest 0.01% have taken around $1.2 trillion out of the United States, principally to avoid paying taxes.
So, in terms of magnitude, American plutocrats match every dollar that Russian plutocrats stash abroad to escape scrutiny with $10 of their own.
As for the relative political clout of Russian and American billionaires, it is not at all clear who has more.
While there is no doubt that a number of Russian oligarchs have President Vladimir Putin’s ear, he has more control over them than the American government has over its billionaires.
Since the US Supreme Court’s 2010 decision affording corporations the right to donate to politicians as if they were persons, America’s richest 0.01% accounted for 40% of all campaign contributions.
It has proved to be an excellent investment in wealth preservation.
Is it by chance that in the years since the “deregulation” of campaign financing, American billionaires have obtained the lowest tax rate in over a generation, and the lowest among all wealthy countries?
Is it an accident that the US Internal Revenue Service is starved of resources?
According to an authoritative empirical study of the US legislative record, none of this is an accident: the correlation between what Congress enacts and what most Americans prefer is not significantly greater than zero.
So, if non-Russian billionaires are also oligarchs, does the exclusive emphasis in the West on Russians mean that “our” oligarchs, and those nurtured by our allies, are in some sense better?
Here we are treading on treacherous ethical ground.
To argue that the Saudi billionaires behind the decade-long devastation of Yemen are “better” than Abramovich is to invite mockery.
Putin would feel vindicated if we dared claim that the American oilmen who reaped a windfall from the illegal US-UK invasion of Iraq were morally superior to the owners of Rosneft and Gazprom.
To be sure, Putin’s oligarchs turn a blind eye whenever a brave journalist is snuffed out in Russia.
But, meanwhile, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange withers in a high-security UK prison, under conditions bordering on torture, for having exposed Western countries’ war crimes following their illegal invasion of Iraq.
And how did Western oligarchs and governments respond when their Saudi business partners dismembered the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi?
Following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the UK government declared its determination to rip away the veil of secrecy and deception shrouding the money parked in Britain to escape the scrutiny of law enforcement and tax authorities.
Whether the reality matches the rhetoric remains to be seen.
Already, there are signs of tension between the ambition to seize oligarchs’ money and the imperative of keeping Britain “open for business.”
Perhaps the only silver lining in the Ukrainian tragedy is that it has created an opportunity to scrutinize oligarchs not only with Russian passports but also their American, Saudi, Chinese, Indian, Nigerian, and, yes, Greek counterparts.
An excellent place to start would be with the London mansions that Transparency International tells us sit empty.
How about turning them over to refugees from Ukraine and Yemen?
And, while we’re at it, why not turn over Chelsea FC to its fans.

What Next for Great Cities?
PRINCETON – Has COVID-19 killed the megacity?
The pandemic certainly is reshaping globalization, turning the hubs of the pre-2020 global economy into epicenters of contagion and leaving their future hanging in the balance.
But the crisis also has simply highlighted megacities’ existing vulnerabilities and accelerated processes that were already underway.
By the start of this century, cities like London, New York, and Hong Kong had become central nodes in the global flow of money, people, and ideas.
They were not just financial centers but also cultural metropoles, hives of creativity that depended on the bankers’ wealth and patronage.
Entrepreneurs and innovators flocked in, hoping to remake themselves and the world.
But megacities also need a wide range of other workers with different skill sets.
Hence, immigrants flocked to them, too, pursuing fortune or merely new opportunities for their children.
Many dreamed of joining the creative elite.
In due course, thriving global cities became melting pots.
This inevitably created new tensions with the hinterland.
People in suburbs or rural areas came to see urban life as unattainable or undesirable.
The popular mobilization behind Brexit was driven partly by these constituencies’ resentment toward an increasingly multicultural, wealthy London, whose success, they suspected, was coming at their expense.
Even upper-middle-class professionals complained that they could not afford life in London.
Likewise, US President Donald Trump’s supporters in the south, southwest, and Midwest define themselves in contrast to places like San Francisco and New York City. “Make America Great Again” means toppling the coastal elites.
And, of course, the clash of cultures between Hong Kong and mainland China since 1997 has been glaringly obvious, owing to the “one country, two systems” arrangement.
In each case, exorbitant property prices in the megacities have poisoned the social well.
High-quality housing is attainable only for the global elite, leaving all other residents in overcrowded conditions or outside the city core.
Workers with ephemeral or seasonal jobs often have no real housing to speak of, and a growing epidemic of homelessness began well before the pandemic.
Many people must rely on inadequate and unreliable public transportation to commute long distances.
University and high-school students lack proper accommodation.
With COVID-19 came the fear of infection and a mass exodus of the wealthy.
The local economies in upper-income neighborhoods collapsed.
The pandemic brought a new kind of social polarization as service workers in health care, public transportation, and retail were forced to expose themselves to the risk of infection or sacrifice their earnings.
By contrast, knowledge workers simply started telecommuting and ordering in, lacking nothing but opportunities for physical mingling.
The new divide between remote and front-line workers highlighted the sharp class distinctions that many had long preferred to ignore.
More recently, the virus has fueled a search for alternatives to the high-cost megacities of the pre-pandemic era.
For knowledge workers, technology makes remote employment attractive and easy, eliminating unpleasant commutes and the expenses of city life.
Why not work and live wherever one wants?
Of course, revulsion to dangerous, overcrowded cities is nothing new.
The most catastrophic pandemic on record, the bubonic plague in mid-fourteenth century Eurasia, prompted a similar flight.
To read Boccaccio’s accounts of self-indulgent young Florentine aristocrats fleeing for the hills of Fiesole is to link past and present.
In the event, the plague triggered a long-term shift and intensified the class conflict in Florence, as ordinary workers turned against the urban elite.
But the most striking historical parallel for the decline of megacities today is Venice.
Well before the current crisis, Italian and European politicians frequently invoked the sinking lagoon city as an allegory for the absence of reform.
As immortalized by Thomas Mann’s novella Death in Venice, the city has long represented a universal predicament.
After reaching the height of its fortunes in the late sixteenth century, it suffered a long decline, owing to shifting trade routes, new competition from poorer but more dynamic cities, and proximity to disease.
And yet, Venice could also be a model for the post-COVID megacity.
As modern economic historians remind us, the city’s story is not just one of industrial and commercial collapse in the seventeenth century.
Rather, production of the most iconic Venetian goods shifted to the hinterland – to smaller towns such as Treviso and Vicenza – leading the Venetian Republic to build a new political relationship with the surrounding territories.
Today, pre-existing political conflicts have hampered the overall response to the pandemic.
By their very nature, global cities were particularly vulnerable to the virus, and when it struck, their leaders and national authorities began blaming one another.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has regularly attacked British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s shambling lockdown strategy.
New York City’s mayor is in a three-way struggle with the governor of New York and Trump, who himself has used US cities’ crisis to deflect attention from his own mismanagement.
In Hong Kong’s case, the virus created cover for China to assert its authority over the territory with a sweeping new security law.
A revival of real democracy is often thought to be the best solution to the problems associated with technocratic globalization.
But if democracy is to have any appeal, democratic governments will have to be more effective in addressing not just the virus but also deeper sources of malaise such as poverty and unaffordable housing.
Without competent management, megacities are bound to share the same fate as the great cities of the past.
London and New York could sink in their own way.
But, this time, there would be no renaissance in the hinterland.

Beating the Child Killers
GENEVA – Ask most people to name the two biggest causes of death among children, and they will most likely say malaria and HIV.
In fact, it is pneumonia and diarrhea – the “forgotten killers” – that are responsible for the highest death toll, claiming more than two million of the most vulnerable lives every year.
Together, these two diseases account for 29% of all deaths of children under five years old.
That is more than double the total for HIV and malaria combined, and nearly as many as all other infectious diseases, injuries, and other post-neonatal conditions put together.
Yet as shocking as these statistics are, what is perhaps even more surprising is just how preventable pneumonia and diarrhea are – so much so that it would be quite feasible to introduce measures that by 2025 would reduce their death toll to almost zero.
That is precisely what we are now aiming to do.
An ambitious new plan, called the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea, launched this month by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, aims to step up existing interventions and pool global efforts, with the goal of reducing the number of deaths from pneumonia to less than three children per 1,000, and of diarrhea-related deaths to below one in 1,000.
This would effectively end the preventable deaths of more than two million children every year.
For any other infectious disease or global health threat, achieving this kind of reduction in incidence rate and mortality would be nothing short of miraculous.
Yet, for pneumonia and diarrhea, we have every reason to believe that we can succeed, because we already know what works.
For example, infants who are not exclusively breastfed for the first six months have a ten-fold increase in the risk of death from diarrhea, and are 15 times more likely to die from pneumonia.
Similarly, basic sanitation, such as improved hand washing and access to clean water, and better nutrition can also produce significant risk reduction, much of which can be achieved through simple education programs.
Immunization is also highly effective.
Vaccinating children against rotavirus, for example, can protect them from a pathogen that is responsible for 37% of all diarrhea deaths in children under five, thus saving 450,000 lives every year.
Similarly, vaccines exist to protect against pneumococcal disease, which accounts for a half-million pneumonia-related deaths annually.
When combined, these interventions significantly reduce both pneumonia and diarrhea; the problem is that, too often, they do not reach the children most at risk, such as those living in extreme poverty or hard-to-reach communities in the world’s poorest countries.
That is why we now need the Integrated Global Action Plan.
The two diseases share so many common causes and risk factors, prevention strategies and interventions, and delivery platforms for care in clinics, communities, and schools that it makes sense to bring them together.
But, if those hard-to-reach children are to benefit, our efforts must be scaled up significantly.
Until recently, this simply would not have been possible, at least not on the immunization front.
The vaccines protecting against rotavirus and pneumococcal disease are both barely more than a decade old.
In the past, such new vaccines would take, on average, 15 years to reach developing countries – and then at prices that would place them beyond the reach of those most in need.
This is one of the reasons why my organization, the GAVI Alliance, was created: to help accelerate the introduction of new vaccines and make them more affordable and accessible in developing countries.
Through our unique public-private business model, we have worked with our partners to help increase supplies of these vaccines while simultaneously bringing down their price.
Indeed, since 2006, the price of rotavirus vaccine has fallen by 67%, to just $2.50 per dose, while the price of a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has plummeted by 90%, to $3.50.
Such price reductions have and will continue to play a crucial role in saving the lives of millions of children and achieving the Millennium Development Goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds.
To date, GAVI has helped countries immunize more than 13 million children against pneumococcal disease and five million children against rotavirus, with plans to strengthen its efforts in countries where immunization coverage is below 70%.
None of this means that we will not still face significant obstacles.
But the one thing that we know about immunization is that we can reach everyone.
We did it with smallpox, which has now been eradicated, and we are doing it with polio (with less than 100 cases worldwide this year).
The challenge now is to do the same with all of our life-saving vaccines – particularly those that target the biggest killers of children.

Can We Regulate Systemic Risk?
MILAN – In the past two years, two dangerous episodes of financial instability and sudden changes in market dynamics have hit the world economy.
More are likely, because the global economy is out of balance in several respects as it emerges from the crisis, particularly in terms of sovereign debt and the structure of global demand.
Systemic risks drive most crises, and pose a challenge for several reasons.
First, they are not easy to detect with confidence, and are even more difficult to prove.
Second, predicting the exact timing of a break point (when bubbles burst, markets lock up, and credit freezes) is, and will likely remain, beyond our ability.
Finally, crises are highly non-linear events, which means that they occur without much warning.
Periodic outbreaks of instability impose high social costs on those who had the least to do with causing them.
If repeated, this pattern may erode confidence in financial markets and regulators, which could well lead to heavy-handed regulation, the expansion of the state, and retrenchment from globalization.
But the problem is even more serious.
The financial and economic crisis is morphing into a sovereign debt crisis in advanced countries.
Financial and economic imbalance can lead to dangerous fiscal imbalance, as tax revenues plunge and social insurance and bailout expenditures rise.
The International Monetary Fund suggests that as much as 75% of the “fiscal stimulus” in the advanced countries comprises non-discretionary counter-cyclical measures.
Undetected imbalances and systemic risk make fiscal policies seem prudent when they are not.
Spain, for example, was not running a fiscal deficit coming into the crisis.
But its revenues and expenditures were in part determined by a highly leveraged real-estate bubble.
Extreme fiscal imbalance can also lead to a growth trap in which fiscal consolidation has such a large negative effect on growth as to be self-defeating.
Greece is probably a case in point.
Eventually, the only way out is to reset the value of liabilities via restructuring or inflation.
If systemic risk can cause this kind of cascading sequential imbalance, then the “sovereign” needs to be alert, competent at identifying rising systemic risk, and able to take corrective action early.
We are about to get a comprehensive package of re-regulation focused on capital requirements and leverage, transparency, ratings and other sources of information, incentives, conflicts of interest and limits on the scope of financial firms, consumer protection, and resolution mechanisms.
The hope is that such reforms will reduce the likelihood and severity of systemic risk.
But that doesn’t deal with global imbalances and other contributors to and signs of instability.
In addition and as a complement to re-regulation, we need a comprehensive systemic risk monitor.
Some prominent policymakers and analysts, however, argue that oversight aimed at identifying and stemming systemic risk is futile.
With incomplete models of risk dynamics and a complex and constantly changing global financial system, detection is, they argue, either impossible or so prone to error that the effort would be counter-productive.
Asset bubbles are hard to identify with certainty.
If skeptics are right, then we should accept that we will periodically be out of financial and fiscal balance without knowing it in advance.
Thus, we should also accept the need for much more conservative fiscal positioning than was thought necessary even three years ago.
In statistics and the theory of decision-making under uncertainty, errors are inevitable. There are two kinds.
One error is to reject a true proposition; the other is to accept a false one.
Let’s call them RWT (reject when true) and AWF (accept when false).
The issue can then be framed as follows: in the context of detecting and responding to systemic risk, which of the two types of errors has the higher expected costs?
Opponents of prudential oversight of systemic risk take two different positions.
One is that the AWF error won’t occur, because there are no reliable ex ante signs of rising potential instability.
Looking for them is a waste of resources.
Instability just strikes like lightning.
This seems wrong.
In the 2008 crisis, for example, some analysts issued warning signs, and some investors noted and responded to them.
Admittedly, these warnings did not add up to an ironclad case, and they certainly didn’t predict the timing of the break.
But the signs were there.
A second position accepts that there are warning signs, but that they are so unreliable that responding to them would do more harm than good.
This implies that AWF has a higher expected cost than RWT, because there are a lot of false positives and/or the cure is worse than the disease.
One can accept that there are costs to AWF.
But RWT is costly, too, as we have seen, so the aggregate negative effect of the policy response to false positives (AWF) would have to be large to be convincing.
I am not convinced.
There may be a deeper bias at work.
In business and investing, choices under conditions of uncertainty are made all the time, and mistakes are routine.
By contrast, developed country policymakers’ default stance seems to be that proactive or preemptive measures require a high degree of certainty, owing to a deep-seated belief that financial markets are stable and self-regulating.
If one believes that market instability is rare, then it is reasonable to refuse to act unless there is a compelling case to do so.
In light of experience, the view that the financial system is only exceptionally unstable or on an unsustainable path seems at least questionable.
Based on new theory and experience, we may eventually conclude that policy responses to systemic risk are impossible to devise, and that the costs of the AWF errors are higher than the RWT errors.
But we should at least conduct the experiment, assigning responsibility to a new or existing institution that has access to information, deep analytical talent in both financial and macroeconomic analysis, and is relatively free of conflicts of interest.
The analysis should be made public and could influence perceptions of systemic risk and market behavior, thereby increasing self-regulatory capacity of the system.

The Afghan Endgame Mirage
STOCKHOLM – On a recent visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan, I could not fail to notice the increasingly frequent international calls for an “endgame” in Afghanistan.
But an endgame for that country is a dangerous illusion: the game will not end, and neither will history.
The only thing that could come to an end is the world’s attention and engagement in Afghanistan, which could well lead to catastrophic consequences.
Much international focus is now on the year 2014, the target date for completion of the gradual transfer of responsibility for security from international forces to the Afghan government.
This process is not without challenges, but there is no reason to believe that it could not be finalized more or less according to plan and the current timetable.
My belief is that there is another, far more critical challenge facing Afghanistan in 2014: the election of a new president.
In a system where so much power – open and hidden, constitutional and traditional – is centered around the president, the election could well turn into an all-out battle for the country’s future.
The presidential election of 2009 – in which Hamid Karzai gained a second term – was a highly contentious affair, and neither the Afghan political system nor the international community came through it with flying colors.
Together with the battle over the Taliban’s future role in the country, the struggle for power in 2014 could reanimate divisions that take the country back to the brink of a wider civil war, with the liberal technocrats of Kabul crushed between a resurgent Northern Alliance and a wider “Pashtun Pact.”
Such a scenario would, of course, spell disaster for Afghanistan.
But the implications would be far broader.
We must not ignore the grave dangers that it would pose for Pakistan, where a new round of jihadist rhetoric and mobilization could be fatal to hopes of building a stable and more secure country.
We should have learned the lesson of the 1980’s: ignorance is not bliss.
What, then, is the proper policy for the international community?
First, we must focus on what is most important – a transition to a post-Karzai system that is seen as reasonably legitimate by all parts of Afghanistan.
This is primarily a question of making the elections as free and as fair as possible, and here the United Nations’ role will be critical.
But it is also imperative to establish a wide national consensus on the rules of the game.
Karzai can leave no better legacy than an orderly transition, and has no interest in seeing all that he has achieved go up in flames.
Second, we must encourage a true regional dialogue that prevents Afghanistan from becoming a battleground for devastating proxy wars.
Here, the key will be to bridge the gulf between Pakistan’s government and the forces of northern Afghanistan.
Pakistan must do whatever is necessary to convince everyone that it will not play a hidden game with the Taliban – assuming, of course, that it has no such intention.
It is equally important that Pakistan and India engage in an open dialogue that can establish trust and transparency in their respective policies concerning Afghanistan.
Today, this dialogue hardly exists, and their mutual maneuvering, fueled by mistrust, could easily destabilize their weaker neighbor.
Finally, for reasons of history, geography, and culture, Iran’s role in Afghanistan cannot and should not be ignored.
There is no reason why the West’s strategic objectives concerning Afghanistan should change fundamentally in the coming years.
The key now is to get our priorities right.
Securing an orderly political transition and encouraging a deep and broad regional dialogue should now be at the top of the international agenda for Afghanistan.
Not only are these objectives important in themselves; they are also central in creating the right framework for a settlement between the various Afghan parties and the Taliban.
Some now argue that large-scale engagement in Afghanistan was a mistake.
But, in the mirror of history, we can see that the greater mistake has been to abandon the country altogether.
Afghanistan connects Central and South Asia, and a breakdown of order there would pose grave risks in both directions.
Moreover, the world – not just the West, but Russia and China as well – would risk global proliferation of drugs, weapons, and terror.
The task now is not to seek an illusory endgame.
The book is not finished; we are merely entering a new chapter. What we must do now is create the framework for a more stable Afghanistan, and for sustained international engagement in a region that is crucial for global stability.

The Post-Vaccine Risk Phase
PARIS/WASHINGTON, DC – For all the drama over sluggish COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and export restrictions, there is little doubt that the vast majority of people in the United States and Europe will have been vaccinated by summer.
Death tolls will differ according to each country’s policy record, but the public-health situation will have become largely the same for Americans, Europeans, and Britons.
But there is considerable uncertainty about how much of pre-pandemic social life will return, and how long it will last.
Some constraints doubtless will remain in place.
The recovery in travel, for example, will be slow and uneven, and there will probably be “travel bubbles” – a scenario already anticipated in Australia and New Zealand, where the virus has been nearly eliminated.
The European Union, for its part, will likely accommodate the summer travel season by introducing quarantine-free border crossing for those with vaccine passports.
But restrictions on long-distance travel will remain.
Disparities in the pace and scope of the resumption of social activities will most likely coincide with income gaps.
While some emerging markets will have reached high vaccination rates (Chile, Morocco, and Turkey are already ahead of the EU), most of the developing world will not have contained the virus.
Accordingly, border controls between the vaccinated rich world and the unvaccinated poor world will probably tighten, especially if new variants continue to emerge.
The adverse fallout will be felt most directly by migrant workers, but there will be broader consequences, such as a contraction of long-distance tourism, which will severely undercut some economies.
Moreover, globalization will be affected.
Although barely any person-to-person contact is required to ship a container halfway around the world, the same cannot be said for managing production networks or finding new clients.
The evidence suggests that measures altering the movement of people (such as new visa rules or the opening of new travel routes) do indeed affect trade in goods.
Lasting obstacles to passenger travel would ultimately reduce international trade and investment, productivity, and growth overall.
More important, a full (if gradual) return to normal life will be possible only if vaccines remain effective.
So far, they seem to be succeeding brilliantly.
But the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants would force governments to keep severe restrictions in place, possibly with recurrent lockdowns.
Some experts, such as Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, regard this scenario as likely.
But even if it is only a tail risk, it demands our attention.
Surprisingly little is known about the trade-off between public health and economic activity in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
Scoreboards based on GDP growth rates and death tolls may generate plenty of commentary, but they are grossly misleading.
Italy experienced sharp losses of life as well as GDP last year not because its policy response was inefficient, but because it was the first European country to be hit, and thus had to respond to the unanticipated shock with economically costly measures.
To gauge how countries have managed this trade-off – and how they might continue to do so if the pandemic persists – we have compared the week-by-week evolution of infections with economic activity, as measured by the OECD GDP Tracker.
Before the British variant (B.1.1.7) emerged, COVID-19’s contagiousness, as measured by its “reproduction rate” (R), was about three, meaning that one infected person could be expected to contaminate three others.
The aim of confinement measures was thus to reduce R to below one, at which point viral incidence would be diminishing rather than growing.
In the spring of 2020, several European countries managed to reduce R from three to about 0.7 within the course of a few weeks.
Here, the corresponding reduction in economic activity varied from around 15% in Germany (where the first wave was mild) to nearly 30% in France, where construction stopped altogether and one-quarter of private-sector employees were placed on furlough.
The treatment was effective, but it came at an extremely high economic cost.
By contrast, when Europe braced for another lockdown episode in the fall, the economic cost of public-health measures was much lower.
R was brought down to about the same level (0.8), but the economic cost was 2-3 times lower, and the effect was remarkably uniform across countries.
The reason is that governments had learned from the first wave.
The second-wave response was less stringent but better targeted.
Masks and protective equipment were more widely available, and companies had learned to adapt to the restrictions.
Some of these adaptations have proved lasting: electronic payments have received a significant boost; e-commerce is booming; and companies in affected sectors managed to do business or even thrive.
In France, where restaurants are closed and hotels are facing severe restrictions, one out of four nonetheless reported that activity had recovered by more than half in February (and 10% said it had returned to normal).
As for the future, the recurring emergence of variants would make further adaptations more likely.
But if these variants are more contagious, the costs will rise.
Companies that have been kept on life support by liquidity injections and tax deferrals won’t survive, and workers still on furlough (including 4.5 million British workers in January) will either lose their skills or their jobs.
Major efforts will be needed to help them change occupations.
The longer the pandemic lasts, the more severe the damage will be, and the higher the costs.
A truly global vaccination rollout therefore remains vital.
In the meantime, governments must prepare for the risk of periodic outbreaks by devising new policies to contain their social, economic, and fiscal costs.

Lessons of the Lebanon War
Wars are won not only on battlefields, but also in people’s minds.
So, while Hezbollah has not decisively won its current war with Israel, by maintaining its ability to fight in the face of the might of the Israeli army, it has captured the imagination of Arabs, restoring lost pride in the same way as the Egyptian Army’s crossing of the Suez Canal in the war of 1973 did.
Restored pride was central to Anwar Sadat’s eventual decision to go to Jerusalem and regain the entire Sinai Peninsula for Egypt.
Although ordinary Lebanese have paid a huge human, economic, and infrastructural price, Hezbollah has made it clear to the Israelis that they can no longer take their military predominance for granted.
The limits of military power have been exposed.
Moreover, the madness of war has been clearly demonstrated to all, and, once the current fighting is over, both sides are now more likely to be cautious about actions that might push their peoples and countries into war once more.
How this war is concluded will likely change the ways in which both Israel and the international community deal with the fundamental national aspirations of Arab peoples.
Holding Arab land and prisoners indefinitely will no longer be an asset but a terrible burden.
Conventional thinking in the Middle East has largely been built on Israel’s overwhelming military strength, together with the disunity and lack of purpose of Arab leaders.
But, in less than two months, the almost mythic power of the region’s most powerful army has been dented, and Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, has come across as a steadfast and determined leader, in sharp contrast to the usual behavior of heads of Arab government.
The question now is whether this determination can bring about the type of surprising breakthrough to peace that Sadat’s newfound prestige in 1973 yielded.
Ironically instead of weakening Lebanon, one clear winner of this war is the unity and independent will of Lebanon.
Whether or not the war in Lebanon has helped or hurt the Palestinians is unclear.
Because most media attention has shifted to Lebanon, the Israelis have had a free hand to continue pressing the Palestinians without international protest.
Palestinians continue to be killed on a daily basis not only in Gaza but also in Nablus, in the West Bank.
More than 170 Palestinians have died since the violence began in June.
Yet the connection between the two wars has not gone unnoticed.
In the United States, President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice see the problems as linked, as does British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Indeed, the crises in Lebanon and Gaza have brought about a realization that two festering issues – Arab prisoners in Israel, and Israeli unilateralism – must be resolved if there is to be any hope of a return to the peace process.
Given that both conflicts were triggered by the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers to be traded for Arab prisoners, Israel must now realize that holding Arabs indefinitely in prison can only beget violence.
Israel’s National Security Advisor, Giora Eiland, appears to have recognized this even before the violence began.
In May, he is said to have advised Israeli Prime Minister Yehud Olmert that Israel should hand over the disputed Sheba Farms area on the border with Lebanon and Syria, as well as returning Lebanese prisoners.
Olmert reportedly did not see the need.
But holding 300 Lebanese and nearly 10,000 Palestinians – all of the first group and many of the second group without charge or trial – has proven to be a major source of irritation to the Arab peoples of the region.
One group of prisoners that will likely benefit from the current situation are Jordanians held in Israeli jails.
Jordan, a US ally and one of the two Arab countries with a peace agreement with Israel, previously failed to secure the release of its 30 prisoners.
They are now likely to be the first ones set free.
Important as they are, however, the prisoners are not the crux of the matter.
The real issue is the unilateralism that has been adopted by the major parties that have ruled Israel.
Both the uncoordinated withdrawals from south Lebanon (by the Labor party after 22 years of occupation) and from Gaza (by Likud after 39 years of occupation) proved that you can’t simply evacuate an area and forget about it.
The population left behind must have secure governments and institutions in place.
On the most basic level, for example, the people of south Lebanon needed maps of where Israel had laid mines, but these were never provided.
The unilateralism that Israelis overwhelmingly voted for in their recent election is based on the idea that security can somehow be achieved by erecting physical walls and barriers.
The barrage of Hezbollah and Hamas rockets has shown the folly of such thinking.
And, although the West Bank has not been used to launch rockets against Israel, there is no reason why the Palestinians who reside there will not resort to such weapons if walls continue to be built deep inside their territories and Israel continues to act with arrogance towards them.
Soldiers are the first to recognize that military power is of limited value in achieving long-term peace.
It is past time that political leaders on both sides, especially moderate ones, also come to understand this.
They need to work together through negotiations to solve problems that simply cannot and should not be solved by brute force.

Coping with Catastrophic Risks
One year after the Indian Ocean tsunami, what are the lessons?
The biggest one is that it was the type of disaster to which policymakers pay too little attention – one that has a very low or unknown probability of occurring, but that creates enormous losses if it does occur.
Great as the death toll, physical and emotional suffering of survivors, and property damage caused by the tsunami were, even greater losses could be inflicted by other disasters of low (but not negligible), or unknown, probability.
For example, the asteroid that exploded above Siberia in 1908 with the force of a hydrogen bomb might have killed millions of people had it exploded above a major city.
Yet that asteroid was only about 200 feet in diameter.
A much larger one (among the thousands of dangerously large asteroids in orbits that intersect the earth’s) could strike the earth and cause the total extinction of the human race through a combination of shock waves, fire, tsunamis, and blockage of sunlight, wherever it struck.
Other catastrophic risks include natural epidemics (the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza killed between 20 million and 40 million people), nuclear or biological attacks by terrorists, certain types of lab accidents, and abrupt global warming.
The probability of catastrophes, whether intentional or not, resulting from human activity appears to be increasing because of the rapidity and direction of technological advances.
The fact that a catastrophe is unlikely to occur is not a rational justification for ignoring the risk of its occurrence.
Suppose that a tsunami as destructive as the one in the Indian Ocean last year occurs on average once a century and kills 250,000 people.
That is an average of 2,500 deaths per year.
If such a toll could be substantially reduced at moderate cost, the investment would be worthwhile.
Educating residents of low-lying coastal areas about the warning signs of a tsunami (tremors and a sudden recession in the ocean), establishing a warning system involving emergency broadcasts, telephoned warnings, and air-raid-type sirens, and improving emergency response systems would have saved many who were killed by the Indian Ocean tsunami.
At the same time, the cost would have been well below any reasonable estimate of the average losses that can be expected from tsunamis.
There are several reasons why such measures weren’t taken in anticipation of a tsunami on the scale that occurred.
First, although a once-in-a-century event is as likely to occur at the beginning of the century as at any other time, it is much less likely to occur in the first decade of the century than later.
Politicians with limited terms of office and thus foreshortened political horizons are likely to discount low-risk disaster possibilities, since the risk of damage to their careers from failing to take precautionary measures is truncated.
Second, to the extent that effective precautions require governmental action, the fact that government is a centralized system of control makes it difficult for officials to respond to the full spectrum of possible risks against which cost-justified measures might be taken.
Given the variety of matters to which they must attend, officials are likely to have a high threshold of attention below which risks are ignored.
Third, where risks are regional or global rather than local, many national governments, especially in poorer and smaller countries, may drag their heels in the hope that larger and richer countries will bear the costs of addressing them.
Knowing this, larger and richer countries may be reluctant to take precautionary measures, as this would reward and thus encourage “free riding.”
Fourth, countries are poor often because of weak, inefficient, or corrupt government, characteristics that may disable them from taking cost-justified precautions.
And the difficulty people everywhere have in thinking in terms of probabilities – especially low probabilities, which they tend to write off – weakens political support for incurring the costs of taking precautionary measures.
An even more dramatic example of neglect of low-probability/high-cost risks is the danger of an asteroid strike, which is analytically similar to the menace of tsunamis.
Indeed, in part because tsunamis are one of the risks of an asteroid collision, the Indian Ocean disaster has stimulated new interest in asteroid defense.
Deflecting an asteroid from its orbit when it is still hundreds of millions of miles from Earth is a feasible undertaking.
Nevertheless, in the United States, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spends only $4 million of its annual budget of more than $10 billion on mapping dangerously close large asteroids.
At the current rate, NASA may not complete the task for another decade, even though such mapping is the key to an asteroid defense because it may give us years of warning.
The fact that a disaster of a particular type has not occurred recently or even within human memory (or even ever) is a bad reason to ignore it.
The risk may be slight, but if the consequences should it materialize are great enough, the expected cost of disaster may be sufficient to warrant defensive measures.

Fighting the Aids Pandemic
CAMBRIDGE: After a wasted decade, the world is rousing itself against the AIDS pandemic sweeping through the world’s poorest countries, especially in Africa and South-Asia.
The pandemic has claimed 19 million lives, and created 13 million orphans.
34 million more people live with the HIV virus that causes AIDS; virtually all are marked for early death.
While first identified in the US in the early 1980s, Aids is now concentrated in poor countries: 25 million people suffer from it in Africa; 6 million more in Asia.
In parts of Southern Africa more than 20% of adults are afflicted.
Poor countries suffer more than rich countries for multiple reasons.
Poverty leads to lower comprehension of the disease, with individuals less likely to protect themselves by using condoms.
Poverty makes medical treatment expensive, so poor people with AIDS often hide their disease because there is no point in having tests if treatment doesn’t follow.
Poverty also induces husbands to work away from home as migrant laborers, creating an environment in which sex with multiple partners is more likely.
Poverty also renders women powerless to reject unwanted sexual advances from men who may infect them.
Even the biology of the disease may be different.
HIV/AIDS may be more readily transmitted in Sub-Saharan Africa because of the prevalence of other diseases, especially other sexually transmitted diseases, that facilitate the transmission of HIV.
The genetic characteristics of HIV in Southern Africa are also different from HIV in America and Europe.
Some scientists believe Africa’s genetic sub-type is more easily transmitted.
HIV/AIDS is the greatest pandemic in modern history.
Because it is concentrated in poor countries, it seems, the world has shrugged.
The World Bank provides only a few millions dollars, not the billions needed to combat the disease in Africa.
It’s almost as if China possessed a cure for the bubonic plague in the 14th century, but decided to stand by and watch as Europe succumbed to the Black Death.
It is time to shift from inaction to urgent combat against the pandemic, backed by billions of dollars in assistance from rich countries.
While no overall action plan exists yet, the outlines of such a plan have taken shape.
A proper plan of action should have three components: prevention, treatment, and new research and development towards medical approaches to controlling the disease.
Prevention is mostly the responsibility of poor countries. Their leaders should speak out publicly and repeatedly against the disease, helping educate their people about how to reduce risky behavior.
Special programs to induce prostitutes to use condoms have helped to reverse the epidemic in Thailand; similar approaches are needed in Africa.
Rich countries must provide urgent funding for medical treatment of those with HIV/AIDS.
This includes: funds to stop the transmission of AIDS from mothers to infants; funds to help fight infections such as tuberculosis that accompany AIDS; and with good program design, even funds for anti-retroviral therapies.
With specially designed, low-cost combinations of drugs, and with the drugs provided to the poorest countries at the lowest possible production costs, it may be possible to extend ARV therapies to even very poor countries at an acceptable price.
The third step must be an expanded program of research and development into new and more effective approaches to controlling the disease.
The most promising answer for the long term is a vaccine to protect against the disease.
Recent breakthroughs in basic science give hope that a vaccine can be developed within a decade, if the billions of dollars of research and development funds are mobilized by both public and private sectors.
A full-fledged fight against AIDS in Africa might require support from rich countries of around $5 billion per year for this three-pronged strategy of prevention, treatment, and research.
Perhaps $4 billion is needed for prevention and care, and $1 billion for research specifically directed at the disease in Sub-Saharan Africa (in addition to more general AIDS research already underway). $5 billion amounts to a mere $5 per person per year, since there are 1 billion people living in rich countries that can donate.
At such a modest cost, and with the stakes so high, it is hard to imagine the world failing to act decisively.
At the G-8 summit in Japan last week, rich-country leaders pledged action.
They agreed to convene in Japan by the end of the year to chart a practical plan of action.
For the sake of humanity, let us insist that rhetoric is turned into real financial support to organize efforts to save millions of lives in the poorest countries.

Is the Almighty Dollar Slipping?
NEW YORK – The recent sharp depreciation of the US dollar has led to concerns that it may lose its role as the main global reserve currency.
After all, in addition to the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary easing – which threatens to debase the world’s key fiat currency even further – gold prices and inflation expectations have also been rising.
But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the dollar’s early demise are greatly exaggerated.
The greenback’s recent weakness is driven by shorter-term cyclical factors.
In the long run, the situation is more complicated: the dollar has both strengths and weaknesses that may or may not undermine its global position over time.
Chief among the short-term negative factors is the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy.
With the United States monetizing ever-larger budget deficits, the Fed’s approach looks more accommodative than that of most other major central banks.
The dollar tends to weaken during risk-on episodes, and vice versa.
That is why its value peaked during the February-March panic over COVID-19, and then weakened from April onward as market sentiment recovered.
Moreover, the Fed’s activation of currency swap lines with other central banks eased the dollar illiquidity that had been pushing the exchange rate higher earlier in the crisis.
Now, a flood of global dollars is putting downward pressure on the greenback.
Moreover, some developed countries (in Europe and elsewhere) and some emerging markets (such as China and others in Asia) are doing a much better job of containing COVID-19 than the United States is, implying that their economic recoveries may prove to be more resilient.
The public-health failures and related economic vulnerabilities in the US are thus further contributing to the dollar’s weakness.
It also bears repeating that before the pandemic, the dollar had appreciated by over 30% in nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2011.
Given the yawning US external deficit, and because interest rates are not high enough to finance it with capital inflows, a dollar depreciation was necessary to restore US trade competitiveness.
And the US turn to protectionism signals that it prefers a weaker dollar to restore external competitiveness.
Even in the short run the dollar could strengthen again if – as the latest global growth data suggest – a V-shaped recovery stalls into an anemic U-shaped recovery, let alone a double dip, if the first pandemic wave is not controlled and a second wave kills the recovery before effective vaccines are found.
In the medium to long term, multiple factors could preserve the greenback’s global dominance. The dollar will continue to benefit from a broad-based system of flexible exchange rates, limited capital controls, and deep, liquid bond markets.
More to the point, there simply is no clear alternative currency that could serve as a broad unit of account, means of payment, and stable store of value.
Furthermore, despite its pandemic travails, the potential annual US growth rate, at around 2%, is higher than in most other advanced economies, where it is closer to 1%.
The US economy also remains dynamic and competitive in many leading industries, such as technology, biotech, pharmaceuticals, health care, and advanced financial services, all of which will continue to attract capital inflows from abroad.
Any country vying for the US position would have to ask itself if it really wants to end up with a strong currency and the associated large current-account deficits that come with meeting the global demand for safe assets (government bonds).
This scenario seems rather unattractive for Europe, Japan, or China, where strong exports are central to economic growth.
Under the current circumstances, the US is likely to maintain its “exorbitant privilege” as the issuer of safe long-term debt that private and public investors want in their portfolios.
The question, then, is what factors might undermine the dollar’s global position over time. First, if the US keeps monetizing large budget deficits, thereby fueling large external deficits, a surge of inflation eventually could debase the dollar and weaken its attractiveness as a reserve currency.
Given the current mix of US economic policies, this is a growing risk.
Another risk is the loss of US geopolitical hegemony, which is one of the main reasons why so many countries use the dollar in the first place.
There is nothing new about the hegemon’s currency being the global reserve currency. This was the case with Spain in the sixteenth century, the Dutch in the seventeenth century, France in the eighteenth century, and Great Britain in the nineteenth century.
If the coming decades bring what many have already called the “Chinese century,” the dollar may well fade as the renminbi rises.
Weaponization of the dollar via trade, financial, and technology sanctions could hasten the transition.
Even if American voters elect a new president in November, such policies are likely to continue, as the Cold War between the US and China is a long-term trend, and US strategic rivals (China and Russia) and allies alike are already diversifying away from dollar assets that can be sanctioned or seized.
At the same time, China has been introducing more flexibility to its own exchange rate, gradually relaxing some capital controls, and creating deeper debt markets.
It has convinced more trade and investment partners to use the renminbi as a unit of account, means of payment, and store of value, including in foreign reserves.
It is building an alternative to the Western-led Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system, and working on a digital renminbi that eventually could be internationalized.
And its own tech giants are creating huge e-commerce and digital-payments platforms (Alipay and WeChat Pay) that other countries could adopt in their own local currency.
So, while the dollar’s position is safe for now, it faces significant challenges in the years and decades ahead.
True, neither China’s economic system (state capitalism with financial controls) nor its technocratic-authoritarian political regime has much appeal in the West.
But the Chinese model has already become quite attractive to many emerging markets and less democratic countries.
Over time, as China’s economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical power expands, its currency may make inroads in many more parts of the world.

The US Still Runs the World
WASHINGTON, DC – Reports of the death of American power have often been greatly exaggerated.
In the 1950s the Soviet Union was thought to have surpassed the United States; today, the Soviet Union no longer exists.
In the 1980s, Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US; today, after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation, no one would take this scenario seriously.
And in the 1990s, monetary union was considered likely to propel Europe to greater global prominence; today, the European economy is frequently in the world’s headlines, but not in a good way.
Now it is China’s turn.
Until recently, China, in many people’s view, was poised to assume global leadership, if it hadn’t done so already.
Today, doubts about the Chinese economy’s long-term prospects are rattling stock markets worldwide (including in the US).
China matters, and its economic policy, including how the exchange rate is managed, must be taken seriously.
But China does not run the world, and it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.
The potential for global leadership still rests, believe it or not, with the US.
The best case for taking China seriously as a world power is made in Arvind Subramanian’s best-selling book Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance, published in 2011.
(The author, now Chief Economic Adviser at India’s finance ministry, and I were colleagues and sometimes co-authors at the International Monetary Fund and the Peterson Institute for International Economics.)
One hopes that the Indian government will heed Subramanian’s account of how China grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements.
China also became integrated into global supply chains – producing things for companies elsewhere – on a previously unimaginable scale, and Chinese managers learned how to make better products.
But other parts of China’s experience have served it less well over time.
China ran a very large current-account surplus during the early 2000s and accumulated a vast stock of foreign reserves – including at least several trillion dollars’ worth of US Treasury debt.
Although this looks impressive on paper, reserves of this magnitude are essentially useless.
If China were to sell its US assets, the dollar would weaken, and US companies would find it easier to export and to compete against imports.
But Americans’ anxiety about being overtaken is not new.
There was great angst in the late 1980s when a Japanese company bought New York City’s Rockefeller Center.
In retrospect, that was one of the great non-events of the twentieth century.
Similarly, Americans will most likely look back on China’s accumulation of US government debt and simply shrug.
The bigger issue is China’s exchange-rate policy.
For a long time, China prevented the renminbi from becoming overvalued – and this was good policy, as Subramanian’s research confirms.
But in the early 2000s, China went too far.
For reasons that are still debated, the renminbi became massively undervalued; exports were much higher than imports, and the current-account surplus reached more than 10% of GDP.
Instead of letting the renminbi appreciate and gradually reducing their reliance on export markets, the Chinese authorities preferred to accumulate foreign reserves (US Treasury debt).
Now China has to figure out a way to sustain growth when demand in the rest of the world is sluggish.
A return to a substantially undervalued exchange rate would almost certainly provoke an international response, including from the US Congress.
But switching suddenly to domestic-led growth is not easy.
China will not collapse (it is not the Soviet Union), and Japanese-style stagnation is also unlikely.
But China is aging fast – and could become old before it becomes rich.
Every decade, important people predict the end of American power.
And there are reasons to be concerned – particularly when some US politicians refuse to acknowledge the nature of America’s global role.
For example, the US built the world’s trading and monetary system 70 years ago, but now Republicans in Congress refuse to support change at the IMF – including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor.
Still, it is the US that is currently leading the push for freer trade across the Pacific and a substantial reduction in barriers to trade with Europe.
If America gets the rules right – favoring ordinary citizens, rather than footloose corporations – its trade initiatives will make a major contribution to global growth and its own prosperity.
Likewise, in terms of monetary policy, the major issue for the world over the next year is when and how much the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
As US monetary officials gather for their annual Jackson Hole conclave, they will consider myriad relevant dimensions of the global economy.
But the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will move interest rates based almost entirely on its collective read of US economic circumstances.
Once again, the rest of the world will react to what the US does.

What’s Wrong with Transformational Leadership?
CAMBRIDGE – This year’s presidential campaign in the United States has been marked by calls from Barack Obama’s would-be Republican challengers for a radical transformation of American foreign policy.
Campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality, but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change.
Things do not always work out as intended.
Foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 US presidential election.
In 2001, George W. Bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy, but adopted transformational objectives after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman before him, Bush turned to the rhetoric of democracy to rally his followers in a time of crisis.
Bill Clinton had also talked about enlarging the role of human rights and democracy in US foreign policy, but most Americans in the 1990’s sought normality and a post-Cold War peace dividend rather than change.
By contrast, Bush’s 2002 National Security Strategy, which came to be called the Bush Doctrine, proclaimed that the US would “identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are, together with the regimes that sustain them.”
The solution to the terrorist problem was to spread democracy everywhere.
Bush invaded Iraq ostensibly to remove Saddam Hussein’s capacity to use weapons of mass destruction and, in the process, to change the regime.
Bush cannot be blamed for the intelligence failures that attributed such weapons to Saddam, given that many other countries shared such estimates.
But inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context, together with poor planning and management, undercut Bush’s transformational objectives.
Although some of Bush’s defenders try to credit him with the “Arab Spring” revolutions, the primary Arab participants reject such arguments.
Bush was described by The Economist as “obsessed by the idea of being a transformational president; not just a status-quo operator like Bill Clinton.”
Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the virtues of “transformational diplomacy.”
But, while leadership theorists and editorial writers tend to think that transformational foreign-policy officials are better in either ethics or effectiveness, the evidence does not support this view.
Other leadership skills are more important than the usual distinction between transformational and “transactional” leaders.
Consider President George H.W. Bush, who did not do “the vision thing,” but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign-policy agendas of the past half-century.
Perhaps genetic engineers will one day be able to produce leaders equally endowed with both vision and management skills; comparing the two Bushes (who shared half their genes), it is clear that nature has not yet solved the problem.
This is not an argument against transformational leaders.
Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Martin Luther King, Jr., played crucial roles in transforming people’s identity and aspirations.
Nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in US foreign policy.
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman made crucial contributions.
But, in judging leaders, we need to pay attention to acts of both omission and commission, to what happened and to what was avoided, to the dogs that barked and to those that did not.
A big problem in foreign policy is the complexity of the context.
We live in a world of diverse cultures, and we know very little about social engineering and how to “build nations.”
When we cannot be sure how to improve the world, prudence becomes an important virtue, and grandiose visions can pose grave dangers.
In foreign policy, as in medicine, it is important to remember the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm.
For these reasons, the virtues of transactional leaders with good contextual intelligence are very important.
Someone like George H. W. Bush, unable to articulate a vision but able to steer successfully through crises, turns out to be a better leader than someone like his son, possessed of a powerful vision but with little contextual intelligence or management skill.
Former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served under Ronald Reagan, once compared his role to gardening –“the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors, interests, and goals.”
But Shultz’s Stanford colleague, Condoleezza Rice, wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was, but tried to change it.
As one observer put it, “Rice’s ambition is not just to be a gardener – she wants to be a landscape architect.” There is a role for both, depending on the context, but we should avoid the common mistake of automatically thinking that the transformational landscape architect is a better leader than the careful gardener.
We should keep this in mind as we assess the current US presidential debates, with their constant reference to American decline.
Decline is a misleading metaphor.
America is not in absolute decline, and, in relative terms, there is a reasonable probability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades.
We do not live in a “post-American world,” but we also do not live in the American era of the late twentieth century.
The US will be faced with a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-state actors.
It will also confront a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to obtain the country’s preferred outcomes.
America’s capacity to maintain alliances and create cooperative networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power.
The problem of America’s role in the twenty-first century is not one of (poorly specified) “decline,” but rather of developing the contextual intelligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without others’ help.
Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age, and what is required to operate successfully in it, will be the real transformational leadership task.
Thus far, we are not hearing much about it from the Republican candidates.

The Ethics of Fighting Drug Resistance
GOTHENBURG – In 2014, the World Health Organization reported that drug resistance – especially resistance to antibiotics – is a growing threat to human health, food security, and “the achievements of modern medicine.”
Far from being an “apocalyptic fantasy,” the WHO said, a post-antibiotic era “is instead a very real possibility for the twenty-first century.”
Drug resistance threatens the effective treatment of a growing list of communicable diseases – from bacterial infections to viral to and fungal diseases.
When people recklessly use antibiotics to fight a common cold, when farmers use antibiotics to boost livestock productivity, or when pharmacological factories emit antibiotics into the environment to cut production costs, the bacteria that the drugs are designed to kill become immune.
The more antibiotics consumed and emitted, the faster resistance develops, leading to “superbugs” that jeopardize human health, both by raising the risk of massive deadly epidemics and by compromising medical services, such as surgery and cancer treatment, that rely on effective antibiotics.
This scary reality continues to frustrate health-care professionals.
To be sure, there are solutions to the drug resistance crisis: restricted consumption, better diagnostics and disease surveillance, and expanded clinical development of new drugs are three.
And some initial coordinated action has been taken in the WHO global action plan.
But every fix has an ethical component, and four years after the WHO’s assessment, the ethical roadmap for addressing this medical emergency remains dangerously ill-defined.
Health-care policies that pursue long-term goals often have short-term costs for human, animal, and environmental wellbeing.
For example, restricting antibiotic consumption in certain populations could lead to job losses for those prone to illness.
Actions taken to prevent infections may also infringe on personal privacy, as epidemiologists seek to identify and track people who carry resistant bacteria.
Controls may even require curbing individual freedoms, like accessing hospitals or getting on airplanes.
Moreover, capping antibiotic use could lead to higher drug prices, threatening access for those who need the medication.
And, while many people might prefer a status quo approach that speeds up the development of new antibiotics while leaving current consumption unchanged, this solution brings its own set of ethical considerations – such as how and when to reduce the length of clinical trials.
For all of these reasons, ethicists, health-care researchers, and social scientists have begun to examine how best to ensure that strategies for tackling drug resistance are ethically responsible.
In 2015, the year after the release of the WHO’s report, the journal Public Health Ethics published a special issue devoted entirely to this topic.
Then, in November 2017, the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at my own university held the first-ever major symposium on the topic, bringing together leading scholars in economics, ethics, law, policy, social science, and health care.
The two-day conference provided a platform for the development of collaborative synergies, and the research output is scheduled to appear in the journal Bioethics.
These scholarly gatherings have helped to foster academic interest in the ethical considerations of drug resistance, but represent only a tiny fraction of what is needed to help the world safely navigate the looming moral minefield.
Any effort to restrict antibiotic consumption, regulate the food and pharmaceutical industries, or change human behaviors – all strategies that are currently being discussed – will require complex ethical reflection and analysis.
The first ethical hurdle is to reach a consensus on how to characterize drug resistance.
Many ethicists see it as a “collective action problem,” a public-health concern that must be addressed in an organized, holistic manner.
There is less agreement, however, on what kind of collective action problem is it.
Is it similar to other global challenges like climate change, poverty, or inequality?
Or is it more of a national issue, best left to sovereign authorities?
How we define the problem will determine what trade-offs people and governments are willing to make.
Several participants at the CARe symposium highlighted this problem, noting that to implement drug-resistance strategies successfully, governments must strike a balance between global medical responsibility and local public good.
One idea that has been proposed is to tax meat produced with antibiotics, an approach that could move animal agriculture in a more sustainable direction.
While meat costs might climb, drug resistance in livestock would decline, as would adverse environmental effects.
The ethical question is whether a solution like this would be fair on a global level, especially if the result is more expensive food.
As drug resistance-related challenges become more urgent, one might think that ethical debates are an unaffordable luxury.
But, given the risks implied by deploying ill-considered solutions, careful consideration of the ethical implications of drug resistance strategies is essential.

The Political Logic of Hard Brexit
PARIS – Little more than three months after the United Kingdom’s decision in June to leave the European Union, Brexit politics are careening out of control in the UK.
An almost revolutionary – and very un-British – dynamic has taken hold, and, as British Prime Minister Theresa May indicated in her “Little Englander” speech at the Conservative Party conference this month, the UK is heading for a “hard Brexit.”
That outcome would run counter to British public opinion, which remains moderate on the question of fully breaking with the EU.
According to a July BBC/ComRes poll, 66% of respondents considered “maintaining access to the single market” to be more important than restricting freedom of movement.
In an ICM poll the same month, only 10% of respondents said they would prioritize ending free movement over maintaining access to the single market, while 30% viewed the two as equally important and 38% considered maintaining full access to the single market the priority.
These findings will surprise only those who buy into the narrative that the West is confronting a large-scale xenophobic revolt against the elites. While the “Leave” camp certainly included many hard Brexiteers whose primary motivation was to end free movement, it also comprised people who believed Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and current foreign secretary, when he promised (as he still does) that the UK could have its cake and eat it.
In fact, despite Leave’s large faction of angry white working-class voters, middle-class trade-friendly Brexiteers, together with the “Remain” camp, constitute a clear majority of everyone who voted in the June referendum.
Under normal circumstances, one would expect the government’s policy to reflect the majority’s preference, and to aim for a “soft Brexit.”
Instead, a classic revolutionary pattern has emerged.
According to the Brexiteers, the people have spoken, and it is the government’s duty to deliver a “true” Brexit.
But the government must overcome the spoilers, such as senior civil servants and the Remain majority in the House of Commons, who favor a Brexit in name only – a “false” version that could never deliver the benefits of the real thing.
In this revolutionary narrative, the worst elements of Europe’s political tradition have crowded out British pragmatism.
What a majority of British voters want is considered irrelevant.
With a hard Brexit, the Leave camp can avoid being seen by voters as the supplicant in negotiations with the EU – which it inevitably would be, no matter how often May denies it.
The EU will have the upper hand in negotiations for two simple reasons.
First, the UK has more to lose economically.
While other EU countries’ total exports to the UK are double what the UK exports to the rest of the bloc, its exports to the EU amount to three times more as a share of its GDP.
Likewise, the UK has a services surplus, which matters far less to the rest of the EU than it does to Britain.
Second, just like the EU’s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, any negotiated arrangement between the EU and the UK will have to be unanimously accepted by all EU member states.
Thus, the negotiation will not really be between the UK and the EU, but rather among EU members.
The UK, without a presence at those talks, will simply have to accept or reject whatever the EU offers.
This would be true even if the UK pursued a prepackaged arrangement such as membership in the European Economic Area or the EU Customs Union; it will be all the more true if the UK seeks a “bespoke” deal, as May has indicated she will.
If British voters recognized their country’s weak negotiating position, the Brexiteers, who won the referendum on their promise to “take back control,” would face a political disaster. Walking away from substantive negotiations is the simplest way to avoid such an embarrassing unmasking.
Thus, politically, a hard Brexit is actually the soft option for the government.
Economically, however, hard Brexit will come at a high price, which the UK will have to pay for years to come.
The only consolation is that Brexit’s revolutionary momentum may not be sustainable.
Shortly after the Leave camp labeled bureaucrats in her Her Majesty’s Civil Service “enemies of the people” – a typical statement in the early stages of a revolution – pro-Brexit Foreign Trade Minister Liam Fox derided British exporters, calling them “too lazy and too fat” to succeed in his brave new free-trading Britain.
Such rhetoric is a symptom of desperation.
It carries echoes of the declining years of the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev, when Marxist apologists insisted that there was nothing wrong with communism, except that humanity wasn’t yet mature enough for it. If developments continue at this pace, the revolutionary zeal we see among British politicians may burn itself out before “hard Brexit” is consummated.

Seeing Through Big Tobacco’s Smokescreen
GENEVA – We all know how bad tobacco is, that it kills millions of people every year, and that it harms many more.
We also know that tobacco companies have consistently lied about how much damage their products cause.
But now, even Big Tobacco has been forced to state the facts publicly.
After losing a string of appeals following a 2006 US federal court ruling, four companies have been forced to reveal the truth behind years of deceptive marketing, by publishing advertisements containing “corrective statements” in US newspapers and on television.
These public statements acknowledge that the companies – Philip Morris USA, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Altria – knew the damage their products cause but kept selling them anyway.
And it is not just courts that are taking action against the tobacco industry.
The recent decision by French bank BNP Paribas to stop financing and investing in tobacco companies – including producers, wholesalers, and traders – is just the latest sign that public health is finally being put ahead of commercial interests.
Still, we must not be lulled into believing that these overdue confessions reflect an industry undergoing altruistic catharsis.
They resulted from the combined pressure of the US justice system, tobacco-control advocates, and the sheer weight of evidence against the industry’s misleading marketing of “light” and “mild” tobacco products.
They should be regarded as a warning: The industry couldn’t be trusted in the past, and it shouldn’t be trusted to do the right thing in the future.
Even today, the same tobacco companies are marketing new products that they claim are less harmful – like “heat-not-burn” devices, which vaporize tobacco to produce a nicotine-containing aerosol – and funding front groups purporting to work for a smoke-free world.
The world has witnessed similar tactics elsewhere, from Uruguay to Australia, where tobacco companies launch costly legal challenges against legitimate regulation of its deadly products.
Despite such losses, it will no doubt continue looking for new ways to oppose tobacco restrictions.
To be sure, the court-ordered airing of “corrective statements” in American media does represent a victory for truth.
It brings closure to an important US Justice Department lawsuit, filed in 1999 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and then left partly unresolved, until October 2017, during a decade of appeals and legal wrangling following the 2006 decision.
The statements detail the deadly health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke, including the fact that low-tar and “light” cigarettes are no less harmful than regular ones; that smoking and nicotine are highly addictive; and that cigarettes are “intentionally” manipulated to “maximize the ingestion of nicotine.”
Even cigarette manufacturers admit that their products contribute to 1,200 US deaths each day.
Around the world, tobacco use kills more than seven million people annually.
Enough is enough; at this critical moment, we must not let the momentum slip.
Governments and health organizations like ours are at war with the tobacco industry, and we will continue fighting until we beat Big Tobacco.
If national leaders, health ministers, and finance chiefs ever wondered how far they should go to regulate tobacco products, Big Tobacco’s admissions, together with investors’ second thoughts, have provided an answer: as far as necessary.
Governments face a moral and legal imperative to use the strongest possible measures to protect their citizens from tobacco.
One way forward would be for more governments to implement commitments enshrined in the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
The WHO FCTC provides guidelines on topics such as tobacco taxation, public awareness and education, and package warnings.
These measures have helped save millions of lives in the last decade, not to mention hundreds of billions of dollars in health costs.
But more can be done, which is why we are calling on governments around the world to strengthen implementation of the WHO FCTC by accelerating action on the “MPOWER” tobacco control policies – measures intended to strengthen country-level implementation of the WHO FCTC.
Together, these frameworks represent the strongest defense countries have against the tobacco industry.
Moreover, governments should endorse the Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, which aims to prevent illicit trade, such as smuggling.
While 33 countries and the European Union have signed the protocol, it needs the support of seven more governments before it can enter into force.
And, finally, looking ahead to the UN’s High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases in 2018, government leaders must be prepared to demonstrate their commitment to protecting people from heart and lung disease, cancer, and diabetes, by supporting stronger tobacco controls.
With its recent admissions, Big Tobacco has been forced to reveal its true nature.
However reluctantly, these companies have called on all of us to reject their products.
We think it is time to take them up on the offer.

The Infrastructure of Recovery
WASHINGTON, DC – Physical infrastructure has a critical role to play in supporting the post-pandemic recovery and in laying the longer-term foundations for green, resilient, and inclusive development.
A growing body of evidence highlights its contribution to a wide range of development indicators, including employment, productivity, income, inequality, trade, and human-capital formation.
Yet, across much of the developing world, infrastructure remains woefully inadequate.
Some one billion people live more than a mile from an all-season road, 760 million lack access to electricity at home, and 450 million live beyond range of a broadband signal.
Even where these services are available, they are frequently erratic and unaffordable.
The disruptions caused by unreliable infrastructure cost individuals and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars annually, and the world’s poorest and most fragile countries have the most expensive broadband, electricity, and transportation services.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, investment in infrastructure was well below the levels needed to achieve global development goals.
And since the pandemic, spending has been squeezed further.
While many developed economies have implemented stimulus packages to support economic recovery – often with infrastructure components – the world’s poorest states lack the fiscal space for such measures.
The last G7 summit highlighted this issue, as leaders called for enhanced efforts to fund infrastructure development in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
To maximize infrastructure’s contribution to the global economic recovery and support green, resilient, and inclusive growth, additional investment must be channeled into effective programs.
Four imperatives stand out.
For starters, meeting global climate targets requires an unprecedented wave of investment in green infrastructure.
Energy and transportation systems together account for around two-thirds of global carbon dioxide emissions, and LMICs will account for much of the projected increase in emissions in the coming years.
Investments in renewable electricity, energy efficiency, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, climate-smart urban transport systems, and emerging green hydrogen supply chains are cost-effective options that simultaneously abate CO2 emissions and create jobs.
In parallel with such new investments in green infrastructure, additional capital will be needed to support the accelerated retirement of coal-fired power stations.
Second, new projects must be designed to promote economic and social resilience to extreme weather and other external shocks.
Climate change is already causing severe damage to existing infrastructure.
For example, in January, Tropical Storm Ana took out around half of Malawi’s meager power-generation capacity.
The following month, a volcanic eruption and tsunami disconnected Tonga’s submarine internet cable.
Such direct infrastructure damage is already valued at around $18 billion annually.
Enhancing infrastructure resilience would add only a few percentage points to existing investment needs, but the anticipated benefits exceed the costs by a factor of four to one.
Despite Tonga’s experience, digital infrastructure is key to making whole societies more resilient to crisis.
During the pandemic, the number of internet users globally jumped by 800 million, and data traffic in emerging economies increased by 25-50% as more and more activities moved online.
Digital applications that support online service delivery and remote work enabled firms and governments to continue operating.
The third imperative is to invest in sustainable infrastructure that promotes social inclusion and addresses different dimensions of inequality.
Despite the surge in digital connectivity during the pandemic, as of 2021, 2.9 billion people remain offline, including more than 50% of the population in LMICs and as much as 81% in the least-developed countries.
Substantial disparities between urban and rural areas, and between men and women in some parts of the world, also remain.
This digital divide has led to serious inequities in development outcomes.
According to UNICEF, lack of access to relevant technologies prevented at least 463 million, or 31%, of schoolchildren worldwide from participating in digital and broadcast remote learning during the pandemic.
Only 6% of children in Sub-Saharan Africa were reached by internet-based remote learning programs.
Lastly, the overall effect of physical infrastructure on development depends on how investments are coordinated with each other and complemented by supportive policy measures.
Across Africa, regional road corridors are critical for intracontinental trade.
For example, an upgrade to the Lagos to Abidjan corridor could yield substantial economic benefits to countries along the West African coast.
But a truck driver making the journey today can expect to spend 160 hours at border crossings.
The benefits of the road upgrade could be doubled if border formalities are also streamlined.
Different types of infrastructure can boost the benefits of others.
Across fragile regions of rural Africa, investments in rural roads have accelerated the movement of workers out of subsistence agriculture into higher-wage jobs in manufacturing and services.
But the economic impact of roads can be several times larger in communities where electricity also is available.
Infrastructure has much to contribute to the post-pandemic recovery as well as to longer-term green, resilient, and inclusive development, especially in LMICs, where the need for investment is especially urgent.
Meeting that need will be a daunting challenge, but also one that can be turned into an opportunity for all.

America’s Economic Blockades and International Law
NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump has based his foreign policy on a series of harsh economic blockades, each designed to frighten, coerce, and even starve the target country into submitting to American demands.
While the practice is less violent than a military attack, and the blockade is through financial means rather than the navy, the consequences are often dire for civilian populations.
As such, economic blockades by the United States should be scrutinized by the United Nations Security Council under international law and the UN Charter.
When Trump campaigned for office in 2016, he rejected the frequent US resort to war in the Middle East.
During the years 1990-2016, the US launched two major wars with Iraq (1990 and 2003), as well as wars in Afghanistan (2001), Libya (2011), and Syria (2012).
It also participated in many smaller military interventions (Mali, Somalia, and Yemen, among others).
While the Syrian War is often described as a civil war, it was in a fact a war of regime change led by the US and Saudi Arabia under a US presidential directive called Timber Sycamore.
None of these US-led wars (and others in recent history) achieved their political objectives, and the major conflicts have been followed by chronic violence and instability.
The attempt to force Syria’s Bashar al-Assad from power led to a proxy war – eventually involving the US, Syria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Turkey, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates – that displaced over ten million Syrians and caused around a half-million violent deaths.
While Trump has so far eschewed a new war, he has continued US regime-change efforts by other means.
Trump is often called an isolationist, but he is as interventionist as his predecessors.
His strategy, at least so far, has been to rely more heavily on US economic power than military might to coerce adversaries, which creates its own kind of cruelty and destabilization.
And it constantly risks flaring into outright war, as occurred with Iran this month.
The Trump administration currently is engaged in three attempts at comprehensive economic blockades, against North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran, as well as several lesser blockades against countries such as Cuba and Nicaragua, and an intensifying effort to cut off China’s access to technology.
The blockade against North Korea is sanctioned, at least in part, by the UN Security Council.
The blockade against Iran is in direct opposition to the Security Council.
And the blockade against Venezuela is so far without Security Council engagement for or against.
The US is attempting to isolate the three countries from almost all international trade, causing shortages of food, medicines, energy, and spare parts for basic infrastructure, including the water supply and power grid.
The North Korean blockade operates mainly through UN-mandated sanctions, and includes a comprehensive list of exports to North Korea, imports from North Korea, and financial relations with North Korean entities. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports that ten million North Koreans are at risk of hunger, partly owing to sanctions.
“[T]he unintended negative impact sanctions can have on agricultural production, through both direct and indirect impacts, cannot be ignored,” the FAO warns. “The most obvious are restrictions on the importation of certain items that are necessary for agricultural production, in particular fuel, machinery and spare parts for equipment.”
The draconian US sanctions on Venezuela have come in two phases.
The first, beginning in August 2017, was mainly directed at the state oil company PDVSA, the country’s main earner of foreign exchange; the second round of sanctions, imposed in January 2019, was more comprehensive, targeting the Venezuelan government.
A recent detailed analysis of the first round of sanctions shows their devastating impact.
The US sanctions gravely exacerbated previous economic mismanagement, contributing to a catastrophic fall in oil production, hyperinflation, economic collapse (output is down by half since 2016), hunger, and rising mortality.
US sanctions against Iran have been in place more or less continuously since 1979.
The most recent and by far most draconian measures, introduced in August 2018 and intensified in the first half of this year, aim to cut Iran off from foreign trade.
The US sanctions are in direct contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran.
The effects have been devastating.
The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Iran’s economy will shrink by 10% between 2017 and 2019, with inflation reaching 30% this year.
Medicines are in short supply.
One might expect that other countries would easily circumvent US sanctions.
But the US has threatened to punish foreign companies that violate the sanctions and has used the dollar’s global clout as a bludgeon, threatening to sanction foreign banks that finance trade with Iran.
European companies have fallen into line, despite the European Union’s express desire to engage economically with Iran.
Over the longer term, it is likely that more ways will be found to circumvent the sanctions, using renminbi, ruble, or euro financing, yet the erosion of US sanctions will only be gradual.
Despite the intense economic pain – indeed calamity – inflicted on North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran, none of them has succumbed to US demands.
In this sense, sanctions have proved to be no more successful than military intervention.
North Korea has maintained, and most likely is expanding, its nuclear arsenal.
The Iranian regime rejects US demands concerning its missile program and foreign policies.
And Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro remains in power.
The US blockades have been carried out by presidential decree, with almost no public debate and no systematic oversight by Congress.
This has been a one-man show, even more so than in the case of president-led wars, which trigger vastly more public scrutiny.
Trump realizes that he can impose crippling sanctions abroad with almost no direct costs to the US public or budget, and with virtually no political accountability.
Military blockades are acts of war, and therefore subject to international law, including UN Security Council oversight.
America’s economic blockades are similar in function and outcome to military blockades, with devastating consequences for civilian populations, and risk provoking war.
It is time for the Security Council to take up the US sanctions regimes and weigh them against the requirements of international law and peacekeeping.

Europe’s Conscience Police
The story of the rejection last autumn of my appointment to be a member of the European Commission is notorious.
Nominated to the Commission by the Italian Government, I was compelled to withdraw because of some allegedly homophobic remarks I was said to have made before the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs. Now that the dust from that dispute has settled, and with a new Commission in place, it is time to ask what lessons can be drawn from this affair.
The first lesson concerns the indispensability in politics of accurate information and reporting.
Democracy works only if there is a fair reporting of the issues being debated.
Of course, everyone is free to comment on and evaluate events as he or she pleases.
But a high standard of fidelity to the truth is needed in the media; otherwise, debates become too distorted for citizens to evaluate correctly their meaning.
Reporters are not entitled to so twist the facts as to reinvent them.
In my case, the main charge against me was invented: I made no homophobic statement.
Nor did I did introduce the issue of homosexuality into the debate over my appointment.
My opponents did.
I did not introduce the emotionally charged word “sin” and tie it to homosexuality in the debate.
Once again, my foes did this.
What I said, instead, was this: I might, as a practicing Roman Catholic who adheres to his Church’s teachings, think that homosexuality is a sin.
This belief could not be construed to have any influence on my decisions, unless I also said and believed that homosexuality is also a crime.
But I said nothing of the sort.
A liberal society is a society in which people holding different moral opinions are bound together through a common rule of law.
In the fields of both law and politics, I have consistently and clearly supported the principle of non-discrimination.
The distinction that I was drawing in my testimony, between law and morals, was not accepted.
Worse, it was turned into a caricature, and then declared false.
Indeed, the committee entered in the sphere of moral conscience by stating that anyone who does not adhere to a positive moral evaluation of homosexuality is unfit to serve as a European commissioner.
This means that anyone holding to the moral doctrines of most Christian churches should nowadays be considered a second-class citizen in the European Union.
According to this principle, Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman, and Alcide de Gasperi – three of the EU’s founding fathers – would not measure up.
What is wrong with the fact that a parliamentary committee passes a political judgment against a Commissioner for purely political reasons?
The rejection of my nomination was, according to many, just another political battle: you win some, you lose some, but you cannot say that you have been unfairly discriminated against simply because you lost.
But the European Commission is not accountable to the European Parliament in the same way that a national government is accountable to its parliament.
The EU’s member governments name the members of the European Commission, and the Parliament lacks an explicit right to veto them.
A hearing over a nomination to be a Commissioner before an EU parliamentary committee should simply examine whether the person is competent in the area he or she is to oversee on the Commission, and whether there are elements of moral indignity – i.e., such obvious moral failings as to be disqualifying.
Now it seems that, according to the committee that rejected my nomination, adhering to the principles of most Christian churches is a cause for such a “moral” disqualification.
The implication of this position is profound and shocking.
If it were generally accepted, it would imply that the EU now holds official moral doctrines, and that allegiance to these doctrines is required in order to exercise the full right of citizens to serve in a public capacity.
That implication is intolerable, and it will progressively weaken and divide the EU through a type of semi-official hostility to religious faith.
Moreover, the demand for such an allegiance is a renunciation of one of the most important steps in Europe’s development.
It has been roughly 300 years since religious people came to understand that being of a different faith, or being agnostic, did not disqualify one from public office.
If the moral test that I endured stands, it means that Europe has come full circle: agnostics are no longer willing to accept that being religious – and having different moral views – should not bar someone from holding an official post.
I hope that the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs will reconsider its behavior, and that the “Buttiglione affair” will remain only an ordinary political injustice against a single individual rather than the harbinger of second-class citizenship for religious believers.
If, on the other hand, the European Parliament’s members follow through on the logic of my case – if my shunning becomes the basis for a consistent policy – the EU will be on its way to creating a kind of morality police and launching a modern-day inquisition, one that crassly violates both freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.

Dirty Populists
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA – The election left one of the world’s largest countries deeply divided, handing the presidency to a military-loving, minority-bullying, media-bashing firebrand promising to smash a corrupt establishment.
I am not talking about the 2016 US presidential election that put Donald Trump in power, but rather the 2018 election in Brazil, won by the so-called Trump of the Tropics, Jair Bolsonaro, who was formally inaugurated on January 1.
Bolsonaro joins the growing ranks of supposedly transformative leaders – including Trump, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and de facto Polish leader Jarosław Kaczyński – who won power by railing against the establishment and vowing to end systemic corruption.
Will he also join Trump, Orbán, and to a lesser extent Kaczyński, in overseeing the spread of new kinds of corruption, while attempting to reshape governance to entrench his own power?
Despite repeatedly pledging to “drain the swamp,” Trump has enabled a level of corruption that is arguably unprecedented in American history, affecting large swaths of the federal bureaucracy.
He has failed to fill open positions, slashed budgets, bypassed established bureaucratic procedures and protocols, and sidelined diplomats.
He has largely spared the military, though here, too, he frequently denigrates his commanders’ expertise in favor of his gut feelings.
When the state apparatus is eviscerated, governance can become more informal, policy more personalized, executive power more dominant, and loyalty to the leader more important.
Trump has installed family members as official and unofficial advisers, placed senior aides in agencies to monitor loyalty, and issued more executive orders in his first year than any president in a half-century.
Beyond blatant nepotism, cronyism, and abuses of office by Trump appointees, this has created new opportunities for “shadow lobbyists,” unregistered influencers who fail to disclose their ties to corporations or even foreign governments.
For example, Trump’s informal adviser Newt Gingrich has lobbied for health-care companies and mortgage giant Fannie Mae.
Trump’s former consigliere Michael Cohen was paid for “advice” by corporations like AT&T and Novartis.
Both former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort were found to have engaged in foreign lobbying tied to Russia and Turkey.
Then there are what I call the “shadow elites”: establishment players who fill intertwined, opaque, and not fully disclosed roles across the public and private spheres.
For example, retired generals and admirals who sit on government defense advisory boards can help shape defense agendas while using their access and information to clinch military contracts for the consulting firms they own or the defense companies for which they work.
Similarly, Trump-appointed officials often have deep ties to the industry they are supposed to be policing – including education, finance, and especially the energy sector – or are expressly antagonistic toward their own agencies.
And the president himself has fused the Trump brand with the office he holds, failing to divest fully from his business, even as he makes decisions (official and otherwise) that clearly affect its bottom line.
Of course, American democracy is still comparatively entrenched, and the Trump administration has faced significant pushback from the judiciary and media (both of which he has repeatedly attacked).
That is not quite the case in Hungary under Orbán, the first of few world leaders to endorse Trump’s candidacy, or in Poland under Kaczyński.
Whereas Trump has facilitated corruption by weakening government, Orbán and Kaczyński have focused on seizing control, changing the rules, and making government institutions their own.
In Hungary, Orbán loyalists have been put in charge of several independent government-monitoring bodies, and the judiciary has been stacked, enabling Orbán to rewrite the constitution as he sees fit.
With few institutional constraints left, Orbán has fostered what Freedom House describes as “large-scale and unpunished” corruption.
When Orbán’s Fidesz party won a decisive victory in 2010, he proclaimed it a day of “revolution,” because the Hungarian people had “ousted the regime of oligarchs who misused their power.”
Yet Orbán has presided over the emergence of a new generation of oligarchs, as he has coordinated with political insiders to deploy state power and resources for the benefit of personal friends and political allies.
Transparency International estimates that 70% of Hungary’s public procurement is now “infected” by corruption, possibly costing the country as much as 1% of GDP.
Beyond Hungary’s own resources, Orbán has diverted to his cronies billions of euros from the European Union, which is now demanding at least partial repayment.
For Orbán, however, the goal has always been to ensure that Hungary’s power players are on his side.
And the plan has been working.
For example, Orbán-connected oligarchs have secured “complete control and domination of the regional newspaper market.”
Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by Kaczyński, who has no official position in government, has similarly set about laying siege to government institutions.
Like Fidesz, PiS presented itself as an antidote to corruption, which helped it achieve a decisive electoral victory in 2015.
But, though the government has pursued some legitimate anti-corruption initiatives, such as a crackdown on tax fraud, it has also wielded corruption accusations as a weapon against political opponents, making much of its anti-corruption agenda look more like an authoritarian power grab.
Meanwhile, PiS has attempted to assert control over the civil service, the judiciary, and state-controlled media.
PiS changed the civil service law to usher out career professionals, installing many loyalists in their place, and replaced many of the heads of state-owned companies.
Trusted Kaczyński loyalists now make major decisions in Poland, with little accountability.
Against this background, a current banking scandal involving a top regulator who appears to have solicited a bribe from a leading banker suggests institutional involvement of PiS- and Kaczyński-linked players and underscores the institutional damage they have done.
Six thousand miles away, Brazil has just inaugurated Bolsonaro, who has echoed these leaders in promising that “government departments will not be led by anyone who’s been convicted of corruption.”
Judging by Bolsonaro’s populist counterparts elsewhere, however, Brazilians should not hold their breath.

Making Business Work for Nature
GENEVA – The latest edition of the United Nations’ Global Biodiversity Outlook, published by the Convention on Biological Diversity, makes for bleak reading.
As the report notes, biodiversity is essential to address climate change, ensure long-term food security, and prevent future pandemics.
And yet the world is missing every target that has been established to protect it.
If this is to change, business must step up.
From the energy industry to industrial agriculture, some of the private sector’s financial success has come at the expense of the environment.
And as environmental destruction progresses, natural disasters are becoming increasingly common – and increasingly devastating.
This is rapidly increasing the material and existential risks to companies’ employees, supply chains, and profits.
This year alone, the COVID-19 pandemic – which has already resulted in more than one million deaths – has disrupted supply chains, tanked global demand, and pushed the world economy into a deep recession.
Meanwhile, businesses in the United States have been facing massive wildfires and rolling power blackouts amid intense heat waves.
The world’s largest tropical wetland – the Pantanal in Brazil – is also on fire.
And China and Africa have been hit by severe flooding.
It is clearly in companies’ interests to avoid the proliferation and escalation of such catastrophes.
Even in the short term, putting sustainability at the heart of decision-making makes good business sense.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, sustainable investments have outperformed the wider market, and the growth of investment in companies with high environment, social, and governance (ESG) ratings continues apace.
Companies aiming to attract investment are increasingly incorporating meaningful ESG action into their strategies.
It is therefore unsurprising that a growing number of businesses are taking action to protect and restore the natural resources on which they depend.
At least 530 businesses have committed to taking action to reverse ecological losses, and at least 1,200 companies are already taking steps such as conserving forests or adopting regenerative agricultural practices.
This includes, for example, the cosmetics giant Natura &Co, which has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions and zero deforestation in the Amazon.
Danone, the European multinational food-products corporation, has become the first listed entreprise à mission company – one that, according to French law, sets out its purpose, and the social and environmental objectives aligned with this purpose, in its Articles of Association.
Furthermore, the water-treatment firm SUEZ has won a design contract to rehabilitate and expand the discharge-constructed wetland at the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park, Asia’s largest petrochemical platform.
The so-called Zone Libellule (Dragonfly Zone) uses the natural environment’s water-treatment capabilities, thereby restoring biodiversity and improving the quality of the discharged water.
As promising as such projects are, however, something is missing: a framework to ensure that the action being taken will be enough to protect and restore nature, and to link initiatives in order to achieve maximum impact.
That is what the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) aims to provide.
Building on the work of the Science Based Targets initiative, which has secured commitments from over 1,000 companies to set scientifically grounded emissions-reduction targets, the SBTN has issued target-setting guidance for companies seeking to protect nature.
The guidance has been produced and reviewed by scientists, as well as representatives from environmental groups, businesses, and consultancies.
It describes five steps to protect and restore the global commons – the land, freshwater, ocean, biodiversity, and climate we all need to survive – while staying competitive.
First, companies must produce a data-based estimate of their value-chain-wide effects and dependencies on nature, and create a list of potential issues and locations that are amenable to target-setting.
Second, companies must set priorities.
Considerations should include, for example, the highest-value ecosystems – the areas where people rely most heavily on nature for their lives and livelihoods – as well as the areas where supply-chain activities are having the most impact.
Once companies decide on key issues and locations for action, they must collect baseline data for those focus areas and use it to set targets – which they disclose publicly – that are in line with the planet’s limits, as well as societal imperatives.
Step four is action.
In pursuing their targets, companies should be guided by a hierarchy of objectives: avoid having a negative impact on nature, reduce unavoidable impacts, and regenerate and restore critical ecosystems.
In pursuing these objectives, they should consider what could be transformed within their organizations, across their supply chains, and beyond.
One example of potentially transformative action that some are already taking is nature-positive policy advocacy.
More than 600 companies – with combined annual revenue of over $4 trillion – have signed the “Nature Is Everyone’s Business” Call to Action, urging governments to adopt policies now to reverse nature loss ecosystem loss by 2030.
This is the first time so many businesses have come together in an effort positively to influence discussions on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
The final step in the SBTN framework is for companies to track and publicly report progress.
The SBTN plans to work with companies to iterate the guidance for maximum usability.
But individual companies’ adoption of science-based targets for nature is just the beginning.
Initiatives must be scaled up rapidly, and that will require unprecedented collaboration, which the SBTN’s common framework for action – and public reporting of targets and results – will facilitate.
We are living through some of the most disruptive, uncertain times in recorded history.
To avoid destruction, businesses must reset their compasses, and help the world chart a new course toward an equitable, net-zero-emissions, nature-positive economy.

Natural-Born Climate Commitments
WASHINGTON, DC – When world leaders gather at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Madrid from December 2-13, they will discuss concrete steps for meeting and increasing national emissions-reduction targets.
But equally important, COP25 offers an opportunity to elevate one of the most powerful tools we have to address climate change: nature.
Nature-based solutions (also known as natural climate solutions) leverage the world’s forests, grasslands, wetlands, and soils to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
Healthy ecosystems absorb and store carbon on their own.
And if they are protected, restored, and managed sustainably, they can provide one-third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris climate agreement’s goal for 2030.
In other words, nature is offering us an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss.
Reducing fossil-fuel emissions is crucial, but it will not be enough to keep global warming below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C, relative to pre-industrial levels.
To secure a livable future on this planet, we also must commit to funding nature-based solutions.
All countries need to start incorporating nature-based solutions into their national climate pledges, and begin investing accordingly.
Two years ago, scientists from The Nature Conservancy and its partners published new research showcasing nature-based solutions’ potential to fight climate change.
Yet natural climate solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention – and even less funding.
Fortunately, this may be starting to change.
In September, nature-based solutions featured prominently at UN Climate Week in New York City.
Although that event did not live up to UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s call for “clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020,” it did offer a platform to a new generation of climate and nature advocates.
From the Youth4Nature coalition to the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, young people were on hand to demand that today’s leaders account for the challenges they will inherit.
Climate Week also produced an announcement from a coalition led by China and New Zealand, focused on encouraging nature-based solutions in both national climate plans and the corporate sector.
And the private sector itself has made new commitments, with a group of 230 international investors (representing $16.2 trillion in assets under management) calling on companies to take immediate action to address deforestation in their supply chains.
Political leaders now must maintain this momentum, by taking a closer look at what nature can do to help mitigate and build resilience to climate change.
For example, one promising solution is sustainable agroforestry, in which food crops are grown alongside native trees.
Expanding this practice can bolster food security and boost incomes in rural communities and simultaneously restore soil health, sequester carbon, and nurture critical wildlife.
Another nature-based solution is being pioneered in Australia, where massive bushfires are putting people and wildlife at risk – and releasing enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The Nature Conservancy is cooperating with Indigenous communities to improve grassland health, sequester carbon, and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
Drawing on traditional knowledge dating back thousands of years, Indigenous rangers set smaller, controlled burns to prevent the buildup of dry grass that contributes to larger, hotter wildfires.
This program contributes to healthier grasslands while generating income for Indigenous communities through the sale of carbon credits.
These kinds of programs benefit people and the environment; but much more investment is urgently needed.
Although natural systems play a critical role in regulating the climate, nature-based solutions still receive under 4% of total public funding for climate action.
France, Sweden, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and a few other countries have pledged to increase funding for international preservation and restoration efforts, and finalizing the details of these programs is now on the COP25 docket.
But unless more countries make similar commitments, natural climate solutions will not achieve the necessary scale.
Worse, natural systems that could be part of the solution to climate change are facing increasingly severe threats.
We have all seen the recent images of fires raging through the Amazon rainforest, which plays a major role in regulating the world’s climate.
Record-high temperatures, environmental crimes, weak oversight, ineffective firefighting, and other factors have increased the vulnerability of systems that store a disproportionate share of the planet’s carbon.
And the Amazon is just one example.
The conversion and degradation of natural land and marine habitats is ongoing around the world.
Such practices undermine our ability to adapt to climate effects like rising sea levels, and directly threaten our food security by wiping out species that pollinate crops, contribute to soil health, and provide habitats for fish and other marine life.
Nature, climate, and human wellbeing are intimately connected; none can be addressed in isolation.
COP25 offers an opportunity for world leaders to seize on these connections in the run up to 2020, which will be a veritable “environmental super year.”
In addition to finalizing an international high-seas treaty and establishing a new framework for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, governments will also revisit their climate commitments at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.
But any commitments that countries make at these meetings will mean little without concrete plans to back them up.
We have the science, and we have the solutions.
What we need now is action to leverage the power of nature.
Our shared existence on this planet depends on it.

Slouching Towards Europe
When communism in Eastern Europe collapsed, the region's new democratic leaders agreed that joining the European Union--fast--must be their priority. ``Back to Europe!'' became the slogan, one enthusiastically backed by a majority of their populations.
Yet eight months before that dream formally comes true, doubts in Eastern Europe about the benefits of EU membership are mounting.
What has gone wrong?
For the new democracies in Europe's east, EU membership has five basic dimensions: historical symbolism, security, economic prosperity, political stability, and a guarantee of the rule of law.
Each dimension has dominated at different times over the last fourteen years; attached to each are different expectations in Eastern and Western Europe.
The historical symbolism of the EU has always been more strongly felt in the East than in Western Europe.
While Eastern Europe's peoples perceived membership as confirmation of their historical affiliation with the West and as another step away from Soviet rule, the EU seemed in no hurry to meet those expectations.
Instead, the EU emphasized the technical criteria of membership.
West Europeans did not seem concerned that early enlargement eastward might speed the consolidation of the region's democratic revolutions.
Reduced to a highly technical and bureaucratic process, enlargement became almost totally devoid of any moral and political ethos.
Meanwhile, the security dimension of EU membership diminished in importance when the US opted for rapid NATO enlargement.
The fact that the Americans were quicker on their feet than the EU also helped to solidify a sense of loyalty that many people in the new democracies feel toward the US.
Here, indeed, the EU missed a big opportunity to tie enlargement to a daring internal reform that would transform it into a superpower.
Instead, enlargement was turned into a dull exercise, in which the ultimate benefits of EU membership became blurred in the minds of ordinary people by the complex process of adopting the acquis communautaire (the body of EU law).
Inevitably, for many the EU appeared to be a bureaucratic monster.
In the end, Eastern Europe's pro-EU elites were left with only one means of stirring enthusiasm for EU membership: general pronouncements about how the EU delivered peace and stability to a notoriously war-prone continent, as well as the promises of economic prosperity.
Going ``back to Europe'' was gone; East Europeans were brought back to Europe by the US.
Now, unfortunately, even the economic benefits of EU membership seem unclear.
Throughout the accession process, the EU made it clear that it could not and would not offer the same level of economic solidarity as it offered previous newcomers to the Union.
The new members could, of course, benefit from investment pouring in from current EU countries.
After all, for many West European companies the existence of a common economic area--and, eventually, an enlarged monetary union--will make it easy to relocate their operations to those parts of Europe with lower costs but identical legal standards.
But even these benefits may be curtailed by the continuing economic downturn in much of Western Europe.
A significant change in Europe's economic fortunes cannot be expected unless deep structural changes are introduced.
But only tentative reforms have appeared so far.
Slower growth in the new member states could also delay the planned introduction of the Euro, which in turn could deter many Western companies from investing in the region.
There seems to be a Catch-22 at work here: introducing the common currency may prompt foreign investment, although this will depend on the ability of the new members to lower their public finance deficits.
But fiscal consolidation requires strong economic performance, which depends on foreign investment.
With the economic benefits of EU membership now seeming much less than expected, the intensity of pro-EU sentiments in the candidate countries has significantly declined.
Although overwhelming majorities voted in favor of membership in virtually all candidate countries where membership referendums have taken place, many people did not turn out to vote.
The best word to describe the referendums that have taken place so far is apathy.
Eastern Europe's post-revolutionary enthusiasm for Europe has evaporated.
To make matters even more complicated, East European countries will join the EU at a time when it has initiated a major internal reform embodied by a new European Constitution.
Given their experiences with the drawn-out enlargement process, most candidate countries are leery about the motives of some large EU countries.
If those countries have been egoistic in the past fourteen years, why should candidates believe they would not misuse new decision-making mechanisms to the detriment of small countries--hence the opposition of some candidate countries to creating the post of a European president.
Such fears have also been strengthened by schizophrenic behavior, particularly French President Jacques Chirac's chastising candidate countries for voicing support for the US regarding Iraq.
So on May 1, 2004, when the dream of expansion is fulfilled, there will likely be little jubilation on either side of Europe.
Instead, apprehension and the desultory hope that it will all somehow work out in the end will dominate.
Then again, given Europe's experience with revolution--in both the East and the West--perhaps that apathy should be welcomed.

Europe’s Fight Against Terrorism
Three years ago this month, international terrorism struck Europe.
In simultaneous bomb attacks on trains in Madrid, Islamist terrorists killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000.
Last month the suspects went on trial in a Spanish court.
Violent extremists claiming to act in the name of Islam have hit many countries around the world, before and after the attacks on America of September 11, 2001.
But the attacks in Madrid – and in London in July 2005 – showed that Europe is one of their prime targets, prompting European governments to respond by bolstering their defenses, including at the level of the European Union.
In the past three years, security standards at European ports and airports have been strengthened, biometric passports have been introduced, and terrorist financing targeted.
More than 2,000 terrorism suspects and those suspected of other major forms of crime have been arrested and extradited on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant.
Similarly, European security and intelligence services have pooled resources in a common center for threat analysis in Brussels.
Through Europol and Eurojust, European police forces and judicial authorities have intensified cooperation, and ministers are preparing to grant law enforcement agencies of other EU countries access to national databases of DNA and fingerprints.
For the first time, security-related research figures prominently in the EU budget, with €1.4 billion earmarked for this purpose.
European police and security agencies have prevented many terrorist attacks.
But, while Europe’s defenses have been considerably strengthened, the threat of terrorism has not diminished.
The risk of new attacks in Europe and worldwide is serious and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
To face this global threat, international cooperation must be improved.
In particular, Muslims and non-Muslims need to combine their efforts to defend the sanctity of human life.
First, the world must work from common standards.
Many countries still need to improve their defenses and implement the 16 counter-terrorism instruments established by the United Nations, including the convention against terrorist financing.
Reducing the risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction equally requires stronger international cooperation.
To this end, the EU is working closely with its partners, from Morocco and Indonesia to Saudi-Arabia and other Gulf states.
The EU will extend support to the African Union’s Center for Counter-Terrorism in Algiers.
Cooperation with India, Pakistan, and Russia has also been strengthened, and the Union will continue to work closely with the US, Japan, and Australia.
Second, more must be done to address the international conflicts that terrorists seek to exploit.
Afghanistan remains a critical front-line state in the fight against terrorism.
The Taliban must not be allowed to bomb Afghanistan back in time.
The EU will increase its aid, notably in support of the Afghan police.
Likewise, efforts to bring peace to the Middle East remain essential.
While progress on the road to peace between Israel and the Palestinians would not by itself stop terrorism, it would deal a powerful blow to terrorist incitement and propaganda.
Javier Solana, the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, will continue to press for results.
Third, we must counter the ideology of the terrorists.
Very few Muslims want to live under a seventh century-style caliphate.
They prefer to live in freedom and in parliamentary democracies.
What unites Muslims and non-Muslims is a commitment to basic human rights.
To respect and promote human rights is critical to winning the battle for hearts and minds, including in Europe.
This means that governments need to practice what they preach.
Detention without trial is counterproductive in the fight against terrorism.
So is torture.
To defeat the terrorists we must offer a vision of a more just and equitable world and act accordingly, at home and abroad.
Ultimately, the values of liberty and justice are our best defense.

Populists Love the Pandemic
WARSAW – Threats to national security invariably limit domestic political disputes.
Now that governments have assumed a leading role in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the political opposition in countries under populist rule is quickly being marginalized.
In theory, the authorities in these countries could use the crisis to invoke a state of emergency to limit democracy.
But even if they don’t go that far, the need for social distancing and other containment measures implies a sharp contraction of the public sphere.
In the absence of large gatherings or campaign rallies, political debate has migrated completely to the media, which is devoting its full attention to the disease.
This is happening for pragmatic reasons – COVID-19 coverage is what the reading and viewing public currently demands – but also for ethical reasons: providing accurate information about the coronavirus is an essential service.
Still, wall-to-wall coverage of the pandemic leaves no attention to spare for political opposition parties and movements.
Hence, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge US President Donald Trump in November’s election, has essentially disappeared overnight from public view.
Americans are instead furnished with daily, live coverage of Trump’s press conferences cum political rallies, in which he trots out government experts who somehow must try to correct his lies and misinformation about the pandemic while standing right next to him.
Similarly, in Israel, Benny Gantz, the leading opposition politician, has decided to join a new government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, citing the extenuating circumstances of the pandemic.
In Central and Eastern Europe, populist governments are exploiting the suspension of normal life to implement long-held plans.
With the international media focused completely on the pandemic, few people will notice what is happening in Hungary or Poland.
Reporting on Poland’s de facto leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán seems to have disappeared even from the pages of media outlets that have reliably covered them for years.
Whereas the Hungarian opposition is protesting against Orbán’s imposed “state of emergency,” the Polish opposition is demanding one.
The West, even if it wanted to protest, could easily get lost in this quagmire and not know what to demand.
Hungary’s parliament has now given Orbán the authority to govern by decree for an indefinite period of time.
Once vested with emergency powers, he will be able to suspend individual rights and force people into quarantine on pain of imprisonment.
His government also will be able to jail – for up to five years – journalists deemed to be spreading false or distorted information.
By contrast, in Poland, the last thing that Kaczyński and his Law and Justice (PiS) party want is to introduce a state of emergency, because doing so would mean postponing the next election.
Under current conditions, Poland’s incumbent president, Andrzej Duda, is certain to win re-election on May 10.
The PiS government is thus using the pandemic to sweep Duda into another term while the opposition is in coronavirus lockdown.
Duda and PiS ran into significant trouble in January and February when they were found to have allocated two billion złoty ($480 million) – an unprecedented sum – to Poland’s public media, which is effectively a PiS mouthpiece.
Since the opposition had been calling for those funds to go toward health care, that decision now looks all the more scandalous.
Moreover, before COVID-19 struck, the opposition presidential candidate Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska was rising in the polls.
In an IBSP survey conducted on January 14-16, Kidawa-Błońska, with a projected 49.91% share of second-round votes, was trailing just behind Duda, who had a vanishingly small majority of 50.09%.
But now that Kidawa-Błońska has been forced to stop most forms of campaigning, her support had fallen to 44.12% as of March 10-13, and Duda’s had risen to 55.88%.
Polish voters, fearing the pandemic, have little appetite for partisan brawls.
The demand now is for political agreement to address the crisis, which makes it much more difficult for the opposition to attack the incumbent government.
Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who recently stepped down as president of the European Council, expressed disappointment as much during a recent appearance on TVN24, where he chastised the Polish opposition for its overly submissive attitude.
Tusk also has indicated that he does not intend to vote on May 10, and that he will not encourage his family, friends, or other voters to do so, owing to the risks of contracting COVID-19.
As he told Gazeta Wyborcza, “Only a madman or criminal could propose holding elections now.”
In surveying who is most likely to turn out on May 10 despite the pandemic, Gazeta Wyborcza has determined that it is mainly PiS supporters.
If the presidential election is held as scheduled, Duda will get as much as 65% of votes in the first round, whereas if it were postponed until after the pandemic has passed, his first-round vote would fall to around 44%.
Kaczyński and his party are not concealing their intentions in pushing for the election to be held during the crisis. “It would be extremely unfavorable for the president and the prime minister to be from different political camps and to argue,” Kaczyński said in a recent interview, “Today, under different conditions, we need effective crisis management and political stability.
This is also the reason why these elections should be held on May 10.”
Meanwhile, elections, primaries, and referendums have already been postponed or altered (to mail-in ballots, for example) in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Spain, France, Germany, and Italy.
It is therefore not surprising that 72% of Poles surveyed believe that the presidential election should be postponed.
After the Polish presidential election, PiS will have a three-year break in the electoral calendar, which it will use to consolidate its power.
Polish civil society will remain the last bastion against unchecked PiS rule.

Britannia Deranged
LOS ANGELES – There are many strands of free-market thinking.
Adam Smith believed it was a branch of moral philosophy.
For Ayn Rand, it was a branch of pop philosophy.
Milton Friedman himself would be the first to admit that free-market capitalism is idealistic.
There is certainly a utopian aspect to the notion that simply liberating capital from all constraints would bring about a free, prosperous society.
But anyone who reads Britannia Unchained – the 2012 manifesto that UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote with other Conservative MPs – will instead find a remarkably dystopian vision of free-market economics.
Aside from the warning that an increase in government borrowing could raise interest rates and sink investment – which, ironically, Truss and Kwarteng did not heed when putting together their “mini-budget” – Britannia Unchained is unmoored from economic reality.
Instead, it is an odd combination of Victorian self-help clichés, Randian platitudes, and incongruous factoids presented in a strange stream-of-consciousness style.
Truss, Kwarteng, and their co-authors depict the United Kingdom as a “risk-averse society” that is “doomed by nihilism.”
Saving it would require a “frontier spirit” that can tap into the sort of growth that the United States enjoyed at its founding (the authors seem to have given little thought to the government appropriation and mass genocide that characterized the American frontier).
The two “frontier” protagonists tasked with building the new Britain are the London “cabby” and the “buccaneer” venture capitalist.
The authors juxtapose hard-working cab drivers with unionized Tube drivers, whom they call “grifters” with “public sector pensions” whose place is among the “idlers of the world.”
It is worth bearing in mind that London public transport workers stayed at their posts and died in large numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, while many taxi drivers have not returned to work, fueling an acute cab shortage.
But society’s most essential members are not taxi drivers, anyway.
According to the authors, that title belongs to the venture capitalists with the “chutzpah” to take bold risks.
The authors are concerned that young Britons model themselves not on these fearless capitalist buccaneers but on reality TV stars, whom they see as sapping the UK’s work ethic.
The Apprentice, the television show that made Donald Trump famous, is an exception: The authors seem to think it is unscripted.
All young Britons should look up to the daring venture capitalists who, the authors claim, created Silicon Valley and instigated Israel’s tech boom.
Youth of Britain, take note: it takes £1-5 million ($1.1-5.7 million) to make an impact as a venture capitalist, and the average VC fund has about £20 million in assets.
At this point, the authors lose all interest in research and real-world figures.
They laud California’s Silicon Valley and Israel’s Silicon Wadi, but appear to be ignorant of basic facts about how either came about.
It is common knowledge, for example, that Silicon Valley owes its existence to the US military.
IBM and Varian Medical Systems got off the ground thanks to government contracts and federal- and state-funded education and research.
It was only after those initial government investments that venture capitalists showed up.
Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, self-styled libertarian and America’s favorite tech maverick, has received government support: $6 billion in contracts, another $6 billion in electric-vehicle rebates, and billions more in grants and loans, including $60 million in subsidies from the state of Texas.
However inventive and productive he may be, Musk owes his empire to the largesse of Uncle Sam.
Truss and Kwarteng equate venture capital with deregulation.
Yet they fail to mention that California, at just over half the size of the UK, has higher overall taxes and more stringent regulations, yet still attracts nearly five times as much venture capital investment.
And while California’s GDP amounted to $3.4 trillion in 2021, the UK’s was an estimated $3.2 trillion, which means that, in per capita terms, California is producing a little under twice the GDP of the UK.
Alas, these are the kinds of statistics one will not find in Britannia Unchained.
Instead, the authors tout Canada – a country with vast natural resources and a little more than half of the UK’s population – as a model to emulate.
They neglect to mention that Canada is hardly a tech-driven economy: it has around a third of the UK’s venture capital expenditure.
While the UK-Canada comparison makes little sense, the book’s thesis comes into focus when it contends that China’s fast-growing economy is the result of individual initiative rather than state planning.
While the authors admit that “effective government policy” had something to do with China’s rise, they ignore the massive state subsidies for companies, the opaque sovereign wealth funds that injected vast sums into Chinese venture capital firms, and the dangerous borrowing that accompanied this process.
The Chinese, of course, would be the first to acknowledge the role of large-scale state investment in facilitating the country’s rapid growth.
But such nuance is too much for Britannia Unchained.
The book concludes by naming Brazil, of all places, an “optimistic” model for Britain’s future.
While the comparison must have seemed odd when the future prime minister and chancellor made it in 2012, today it looks prescient.
After all, their mini-budget, as former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers put it, has made the UK look like “an emerging economy.”
Britannia Unchained’s sheer weirdness and seemingly intentional lack of coherence are breathtaking.
It is terrifying to think that British Conservatives read this book and still picked Truss.
Reading it today, with the benefit of hindsight, one cannot help but recall the famous line from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Ozymandias: “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”

A Crisis of Trust
LONDON – Public trust in financial institutions, and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them, was an early casualty of the financial crisis.
That is hardly surprising, as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed.
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe.
But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all.
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, “Our distrust is very expensive.” The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago: “It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
Indeed, much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained.
Even within Europe, there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are prepared to use more flexible contracts, which are also beneficial for growth and investment.
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that oversee them – has been damaged by the crisis, we should care a lot, and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust.
In fact, the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret.
In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous.
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC.
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets, whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks, which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government.
The market will prove one side right before too long.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Their financial trust index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
That fall in confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators.
Furthermore, the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior.
In other words, if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks.
So falling trust had real economic consequences.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply.
This has been positive for the stock market.
There is also a little more confidence in the government’s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.
The latter point, which no doubt reflects the Obama administration’s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government’s ability to regulate.
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG.
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could, therefore, have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground.
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors.
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
Some people are very trusting of others, and of the firms and institutions with which they do business.
Others are congenitally distrustful.
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals’ income.
A pan-European opinion survey, which has been carried out for many years, allows us to relate the two.
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal.
The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes.
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them?
It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average.
In other words, if you diverge markedly from society’s average level of trust, you are likely to lose out, either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange, or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused.
When anyone I don’t know says “trust me” – an irritating conversational tic – I usually close my wallet.
Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same.
Maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much.

Productivity After the Pandemic
BERKELEY – With COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out and supportive fiscal and monetary policies fueling aggregate demand, the US economy is poised to return to its pre-pandemic output level later this year.
The labor-market recovery, however, will be much slower and unevenly distributed, with employment unlikely to return to its pre-pandemic peak until 2024.
If output growth exceeds employment growth over the next few years, productivity will increase (at least temporarily).
The Congressional Budget Office’s most recent forecast predicts labor-force productivity growth of 1.5% per year for the 2021-25 period, up from an average of 1.2% per year between 2008 and 2020.
In response to the pandemic, many firms – but especially large ones – have made significant strides toward boosting productivity through automation, digitalization, and the reorganization of operations, including a rapid shift to at-home work, to boost efficiency and resilience.
In a December 2020 McKinsey & Company survey of business executives in North America and six European countries representing about 40% of global GDP, 51% of respondents said they had increased investment in new technologies in 2020, and 75% said they planned to do so in 2020-24.
By contrast, just 55% reported increased investments in 2014-19.
Moreover, a 2020 survey conducted by the World Economic Forum (WEF) found that 80% of firms plan to increase the digitalization of their operations and expand their use of remote work, and 50% intend to accelerate the automation of production tasks.
More broadly, recent research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) identifies opportunities for incremental productivity growth across a wide variety of sectors that account for about 60% of the non-farm economy.
These include health care (telemedicine), construction (digital twins and offsite modular construction), retail (e-commerce and warehouse automation), banking (digital payments and hybrid remote working), manufacturing (robots, digital channels, and connected autos), and even the hard-hit travel industry (more agile working).
If all of this potential is realized, annual labor productivity growth in the United States and several European economies could increase by about a percentage point between 2019 and 2024.
But achieving such a dramatic supply-side improvement requires that the productivity-driving changes spread from the large firms where they have been concentrated to small and medium-size enterprises.
Many in this latter group have so far been unable or reluctant to increase their investment in automating or digitalizing their supply chains, operations, and delivery models.
And without such investment, the productivity gap between big “superstar” firms and a long tail of lagging competitors will increase, diminishing economy-wide productivity gains and exacerbating the post-2008 trends toward greater inequality in economic performance across firms and regions and more market concentration.
Equally important is the trajectory for aggregate demand, which will depend on what happens to employment and income growth.
The most convincing explanation for the disappointing productivity growth in the decade following the 2007-09 global financial crisis was chronically weak consumption and investment demand.
While the pandemic-era acceleration of automation and digitalization may boost productivity on the supply side, it could have a detrimental effect on demand, by hampering growth in labor income and consumption – a major determinant of economic growth generally.
During the next year, consumption growth is likely to be strong, owing to the post-pandemic release of pent-up demand and massive injections of fiscal stimulus.
But, over time, the effects of efficiency-focused productivity measures and accelerated digitalization could dampen employment and income growth, cause polarization within labor markets to deepen, and eliminate middle-skill jobs, thereby constraining consumption growth among those with the highest propensity to spend.
The long-run effects could be substantial.
About 60% of the productivity potential identified in the most recent MGI report reflects efficiency-boosting cuts to labor and other costs.
The WEF survey found that 43% of the businesses surveyed anticipate net reductions in their workforce as a result of pandemic-accelerated automation and digitalization.
In a related report, MGI estimates that an additional 5% of workers (eight million) could be displaced by automation/digitalization by 2030, on top of the 22% of workers estimated to be vulnerable before the pandemic.
In the US and other industrialized economies, the largest negative impact of the pandemic on jobs and incomes has been in food services, retail, hospitality, customer service, and office support.
Many of these low-wage jobs could disappear altogether if pandemic-induced reductions in professional office time and business travel diminish demand for myriad services such as office cleaning, security and maintenance, transportation, and restaurant and hospitality services.
Prior to the pandemic, these occupations accounted for one in four US jobs and a growing share of employment for workers without a post-secondary education.
Weak investment poses another demand-side risk to potential productivity growth.
Business investment rates overall were already in long-run decline before the pandemic (hence the post-2008 productivity slowdown), and investment has since contracted further, owing to a decrease in private non-residential investment from its 2019 peak.
That said, the decline in investment during the COVID-19 recession has not been as large as that of the 2007-09 financial crisis.
To realize the potential for higher productivity growth, fiscal and monetary authorities should shape recovery policies with two broad goals in mind: fostering strong and inclusive income and consumption growth, and boosting public and private investment in physical capital (infrastructure and affordable housing), human capital (education and training), and knowledge (research and development).
Given the significant shortfalls in public infrastructure that have developed over decades of underinvestment, the Biden administration’s infrastructure plan could crowd in private investment, boosting overall investment in the short run and increasing the economy’s long-run potential productivity growth.

The Third Way is A Rightwing Way
CHICAGO: "Only de Gaulle could free Algeria; only Nixon could open up China." Behind these slogans rests an notable principle: self-interest often causes political parties to radically depart from, even to abandon, their traditional ideologies.
This insight is particularly useful in Europe, and increasingly around the globe, when examining the actions of supposedly leftwing and socialist governments.
In the late 1950s France came near to civil war over Algeria.
Out of power since 1946, Charles de Gaulle was summoned back to the Elysée to lead France out of this quagmire.
Because of his patriotism, de Gaulle seemed the only man able to set Algeria free.
Starting in the late 1960’s rapprochement between Mao’s China and America became possible because China was involved in political and military conflicts with the Soviet Union.
America’s Democrats knew this as well as the Republicans, but President Johnson was afraid to approach China because his party was supposedly soft on communism.
Only a dedicated anti-Communist like Nixon had sufficient political support from the right to visit China and urge cooperation between the US and China against their common enemy in the Kremlin.
Economics is not immune from this dynamic.
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher successfully promoted lower income taxes, privatization of government enterprises, weaker unions, and a generally smaller role for government.
The popularity and success of their programs induced liberal, labor, and social democratic governments in many nations to also promote free market policies in direct conflict with their traditional ideologies.
Often, only these parties have sufficient political support on the left to succeed in introducing needed reforms in labor and other markets.
Market reforms initiated by the left started in 1984 with a New Zealand labor government which enacted legislation that transformed a small formerly isolated nation into one of the most "liberal" economies in the world.
New Zealand’s Laborites privatized the postal system and many other public enterprises, and changed the country’s employment system from highly centralized collective bargaining to one that gave employers considerable discretion to hire and fire and to pay market-determined wages.
The Democratic Party of the US has in the past strongly supported big government, but under President Bill Clinton it took heed of the popularity of the Republican Party’s stance advocating less paternalism and smaller government.
It was President Clinton, not Bush or Reagan, who declared that "the era of big government was over" as his administration radically reversed traditional Democratic positions on welfare, balanced budgets, public debt reduction, and the encouragement of business.
A telling example of this trend is found in Mexico’s economic policies of the 1980’s and 1990’s.
The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that governed Mexico uninterrupted for seven decades (until its recent loss of the presidency to Vincente Fox) had been a strong advocate of government ownership of heavy industry, prohibitive duties on imports to protect domestic companies, and detailed regulation of labor and financial markets.
Starting with President Miguel de la Madrid in the early 1980’s, however, the PRI responded to free market critics of Mexico’s weak economic performance by selling many government-owned enterprises, partially privatizing the Mexican social security system, and becoming a strong advocate of a free trade agreement with its large “enemy” to the north, the US.
So President Fox needs only to continue this revolution, not start his own.
Argentina’s Senate recently reacted to very high unemployment by passing a labor market reform bill that cuts union power and gives employers flexibility in hiring and firing.
This reform is being promoted by the new center-left government of Fernando de la Rua after the failure of attempts to reform the labor market by the previous conservative government of Carlos Menem.
But it is recent policy changes in Germany and France that provide, perhaps, the most impressive examples of the "de Gaulle/Algeria" and "Nixon/China" theory of political reform.
Both nations suffered high unemployment and slow growth during the 1990’s, in good measure due to heavy-handed regulation of labor and other markets.
Conservative governments in these nations accomplished little in the way of serious market reform, despite considerable rhetoric.
The Jospin and Schroeder governments were elected on manifestos that promised to cut unemployment and raise growth by expanding government regulation.
Each regime did in fact start out by introducing more government controls - including a law to implement a 35 hour week in France.
Both governments, however, soon -- and quite stealthily -- reversed course.
Gerhard Schroeder in Germany has now slashed corporate taxes, is encouraging startup companies, and promises to provide tax breaks for private pension plans.
French Premier Jospin quietly liberalized the French labor market by allowing for more part-time work, increased privatization, and promoted a more globally competitive financial system with reduced governmental control.
If Nixon could seek agreement with Communist China, and de Gaulle surrender Algeria, it is a relatively small step for Socialists to embrace the free market and support much lower taxes on business.
In politics as in life, ideology is usually overwhelmed by self-interest.

A Reprieve for Global Governance
MADRID – The last-minute deal struck at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, offers a glimmer of hope for the future not just of climate action, but also of global governance.
After a year in which leaders reverted time and again to the failed policies of the past to address shared challenges, COP24 showed that there might still be room for innovative instruments for responding to common threats.
To navigate the current era of global turbulence, the world will need forward-facing ideas.
Looking backward will get the international community nowhere.
There is, however, a general lack of political will to take bold action, and domestic upheaval, such as the “Yellow Vest” protests in France, reinforces this reluctance.
At the same time, today’s leaders lack ideas.
Amid shifting global power dynamics, diminished political legitimacy, and disruptive technological change, it is more difficult than ever to devise promising solutions.
Unless and until that changes, we will not escape our current cycle of dysfunction and insecurity.
A couple of years ago, the world seemed to be stepping up to the challenge with innovative governance models in a range of areas that rested heavily on soft or non-binding mechanisms, rather than the strict rules of the past.
Some of these models incorporated non-state actors.
All of them are now on life support, replaced by traditional policy measures that have proven ineffective in the past.
The 2015 Iran nuclear deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is a leading example.
After nearly two decades of failed efforts to conclude a deal covering all of the international community’s grievances against Iran, negotiators decided to aim for a narrower, nuclear-focused agreement.
This would lay the groundwork for future talks on other issues, such as Iran’s missile development and support for terrorist groups.
But then, after winning the 2016 US presidential election, Donald Trump decided that unless the JCPOA addressed every issue exactly as he would have wanted, it was worthless.
So he decided unilaterally to withdraw the US from the deal and re-impose strict economic sanctions on Iran.
But the sanctions-based approach didn’t work even when there was an international consensus behind it.
With the US going it alone, it will be virtually impossible to generate the pressure needed to compel Iran to negotiate a more comprehensive agreement.
Europe’s effort to keep the JCPOA alive by shielding European companies from American penalties is also unlikely to succeed.
A unilateral sanctions regime will most probably lead Iran to restart its nuclear program, implying renewed hostility with the West.
Likewise, until Trump took power, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) represented a next-generation trade agreement linking the United States with 11 other Pacific Rim economies.
Following the failure of the Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations, the international trade agenda came to hinge on the pursuit of mega-regional deals.
The TPP, in particular, would not only offer a new approach to multilateral trade negotiations; it would also counter China’s growing influence in Asia.
Here, too, by withdrawing the US from the TPP immediately after taking office, Trump crippled the agreement.
Though the other 11 countries have continued to move the deal forward, in the form of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), America’s departure has undermined momentum toward greater trade multilateralism.
Trump’s subsequent actions, most notably his trade war with China, recall the disastrous protectionism of the 1930s.
Cooperation on migration has similarly regressed.
On September 19, 2016, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants – a tentative step toward broad, non-binding, internationally accepted general principles for responding to the growing migration challenge.
In July, the General Assembly took this a step further, producing the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which set out universal best practices.
The Compact was supposed to be adopted at an inter-governmental conference in Marrakesh earlier this month.
But as the conference approached, a growing number of countries, led by the US, complained that the Compact enabled the imposition of binding obligations in the future, thus infringing on their sovereignty.
While the agreement was ultimately adopted, there is little reason to believe that countries will, overall, choose a common approach.
That brings us to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which was hailed as both a breakthrough in addressing climate action and a pioneering approach to global governance.
By establishing a framework of overlapping soft and hard obligations, the Paris accord evaded objections that had previously blocked progress.
But, again, Trump decided to withdraw the US from the agreement, undermining its legitimacy and effectiveness.
Although the US cannot officially renounce the Paris accord until 2020, Trump’s move hampered the next phase of the process: agreement, at the climate conference in Katowice, on specific rules for implementation and monitoring.
At first, prospects looked bleak, as leaders became distracted by peripheral dramas, such as Poland’s promotion of coal and a Saudi-US-Russian-Kuwaiti effort to block a key scientific report.
But, motivated by rapidly worsening climate conditions – global carbon dioxide emissions rose in 2017 for the first time in four years – negotiators ultimately managed to secure a last-minute deal.
The JCPOA, TPP, New York Declaration, and the Paris agreement all have their flaws.
But they reflect the kind of foresight and experimentation that will be needed to address transnational challenges in a deeply interconnected and fast-changing world.
Allowing them to be undermined in favor of retrograde policies is a recipe for disaster.
The deal struck in Katowice – to which even the US agreed – shows that, when the stakes are high enough, cooperation is possible.
Successfully addressing the world’s myriad shared challenges requires nothing less.
But it also requires something more: new ideas about how global governance should be organized.
We can no longer afford the failed approaches of the past.

American Democracy and Soft Power
CAMBRIDGE – At a recent meeting of trans-Atlantic foreign policy experts, a European friend told the group that he used to worry about a decline in American hard power, but felt reassured.
On the other hand, he now worried more about what was happening internally and how that would affect the soft power that underlies American foreign policy.
Are his fears justified?
Smart political leaders have long understood that values can create power.
If I can attract you and persuade you to want what I want, then I do not have to force you or pay you to do what I want.
If the United States (or any country) represents values that others find attractive, it can economize on sticks and carrots.
US soft power rests partly on American culture and foreign policies when they are attractive to others; but it also rests on our values and how we practice democracy at home.
As international polls show, President Donald Trump’s term in office was not kind to American soft power.
This was partly a reaction to Trump’s nativist foreign policy, which shunned allies and multilateral institutions, as well as to his administration’s incompetent response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But even more damaging to US soft power was Trump’s effort to disrupt the orderly transition of political power after he lost the 2020 election.
And on January 6, 2021, as Republican Senator Ben Sasse described the invasion of the US Capitol, “the world’s greatest symbol of self-government was ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard tweeting against his Vice President for fulfilling the duties of his oath to the Constitution.”
America’s allies and other countries were shocked, and America’s attractiveness was diminished.
Can US soft power recover?
It would not be the first time.
The US has serious problems, but it also has a capacity for resilience and reform that has rescued it in the past.
In the 1960s, America’s legacy of racism fueled major urban riots, and protests against the Vietnam War grew increasingly violent.
Bombs exploded in universities and government buildings.
The National Guard killed student protesters at Kent State University.
We witnessed the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and two Kennedys.
Populist demagogues like George Wallace fanned the flames of hate.
Yet within a decade, Congress enacted a series of political reforms, and the honesty of Gerald Ford, the human rights policies of Jimmy Carter, and the optimism of Ronald Reagan helped restore America’s attractiveness.
Moreover, even when protesters marched through the world’s streets condemning American policies in Vietnam, they were more likely to sing “We Shall Overcome” than the “Internationale.”
The anthem of the civil rights movement illustrated that America’s power to attract rested not on its government’s policy but in large part on its civil society and its capacity for self-criticism and reform.
Unlike hard-power assets (such as armed forces), many soft-power resources are separate from the government and attract others despite politics.
Hollywood movies and popular music showcasing independent women or empowered minorities can attract others.
So, too, does America’s diverse and free press, the charitable work of its foundations, and the freedom of inquiry at its universities.
America’s firms, universities, foundations, churches, and protest movements develop soft power of their own, which may reinforce others’ views of the country.
But while peaceful protests can generate soft power, the mob in and around the Capitol on January 6 was far from peaceful.
The events of that day were a disturbing illustration of the way that Trump exacerbated political polarization, which he continues to do by making his myth of a stolen election a litmus test in the Republican Party.
To be sure, the US had experienced an increase in political polarization well before Trump was elected in 2016.
Trump’s innovation was to exploit and exacerbate nativist populism as a political weapon to take control of the GOP, cowing congressional Republicans with threats of a primary challenge from his supporters.
Many still are too scared to oppose his lies about the 2020 election.
Fortunately, in a federal system, many state officials and legislators stood up to Trump’s efforts to intimidate them into “finding” votes.
Some pessimists worry whether this can continue.
For those who are mourning the demise of American democracy, it is important to remember that unprecedented turnout in the 2020 election unseated a demagogue.
And the outcome was upheld in more than 60 court cases overseen by an independent judiciary, including some of Trump’s appointees.
And the outcome was finally certified by Congress.
This does not mean that all is well with American democracy.
The Trump presidency eroded a range of democratic norms.
Polarization persists, and most Republicans believe his lies about the election.
Social media business models exacerbate the existing polarization by relying on algorithms that profit from eliciting user “engagement,” and companies like Facebook and Google, under pressure from public opinion and Congressional hearings, are only slowly beginning to respond.
At the same time, American culture still has sources of resilience that pessimists in the past have underestimated.
Press freedom, independent courts, and the right to peaceful protest are among the greatest sources of America’s soft power.
Even when mistaken government policies reduce America’s attractiveness, its capacity for self-reflection and self-correction makes it attractive to others at a deeper level.
As I told my skeptical European friend, values change with generations, and the younger generation is a source of hope.

The Next Trade Breakthroughs
STANFORD – Economic news is grim all around the world.
This year’s output growth has been disappointing, and the International Monetary Fund expects only a slight improvement in 2015.
Europe may be sliding back into recession, with even the once-robust German economy teetering on the brink.
China is downshifting, and Brazil, Russia, and India are struggling to avoid a stall.
So it is a pity that three important opportunities for growth from trade liberalization – the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Round, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in the Asia-Pacific region, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and Europe – are being neglected.
If designed properly, all three have the potential to spur global growth.
Through the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, the protection of intellectual property, and the harmonization of regulations, hundreds of billions of dollars of output – and millions of better-paying jobs – could be generated.
This is the lesson of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which celebrates its 20th birthday this year.
In NAFTA at 20, a book that I edited, policymakers and scholars explain how the landmark trade treaty exemplifies the benefits of trade liberalization – and why political leaders should pursue it.
The elimination of tariffs among Canada, Mexico, and the US was innovative, risky, and controversial.
NAFTA became a lightning rod for complaints about globalization, capitalism, and the decline of organized labor.
Many claimed that the treaty would depress wages, destroy jobs, and ravage the agricultural industry in the US.
Instead, NAFTA boosted all three signatories’ economies and became the template for hundreds of subsequent free-trade agreements.
NAFTA helped open what former Mexican Trade Minister Jaime Serra Puche says had been “a highly protectionist economy for five or six decades.”
US agricultural exports threatened some Mexican farmers, but others were able to boost their exports – and profits – to the US.
Meanwhile, the country’s consumers, especially the urban poor, benefited from lower food prices.
According to Stephen Haber, my colleague at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, “After, and to a considerable extent because of, NAFTA, the Mexican economy and political process became far more competitive.”
Canada also benefited.
The country’s firms and workers saw their productivity rise by 14%, leading to what the University of Toronto economist Daniel Trefler estimates is the equivalent of a decade’s improvement in living standards.
“Canada…is a much more modern economy today than it would have been,” says the country’s former finance minister, Michael Wilson.
Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico have become the United States’ top two export markets, accounting for a combined $625 billion in 2013, more than the next ten largest export markets combined.
Prior to NAFTA, exports to Mexico roughly equaled those to the United Kingdom and about half of what was going to Japan.
Moreover, this surge in trade has created myriad well-paying jobs.
NAFTA produced something far different from the outsourcing its opponents predicted.
Some 40% of what the US imports from Mexico actually originates in the US.
For Canada, the figure is 25%.
For China, by contrast, the share is just 4%.
“We’re not just selling things to each other,” explains Serra Puche. “Now, we’re producing things jointly.”
According to Lorenzo Caliendo, an economist at the Yale School of Management, a surge in cross-border trade and increases in real (inflation-adjusted) wages in all three countries can be attributed to NAFTA – even once other factors, like the opening of China, the peso crisis, the dot-com bubble, and the Great Recession, are taken into account.
In short, as former US Secretary of State George Shultz has noted, “NAFTA has transformed the region.”
Today, NAFTA can continue to serve as a model for ongoing trade negotiations.
A NAFTA 2.0 could focus on areas that were originally excluded, such as labor mobility and energy.
The development of Canadian oil sands, the shale-energy revolution in the US, and the opening of Mexico’s oil sector to foreign investment imply the biggest geopolitical shift since the collapse of communism.
Moreover, the finalization of either the TPP or the TTIP could spur progress in the WTO’s Doha Round.
“There is no question that a high quality major agreement today, as the NAFTA was in 1994, could cause multilateralism to take a giant leap forward,” says former US Trade Representative Carla A. Hills.
Trade liberalization has been stalled for too long.
Since the end of World War II, American presidents, Democrat and Republican alike, have promoted free trade as a key pillar of growth.
John F. Kennedy launched what became the Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and Bill Clinton helped secure congressional passage of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which had been initiated and negotiated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.
President Barack Obama has promoted the TPP in Asia, but he only recently asked Congress for fast-track negotiating authority (the ability to request an up-or-down congressional vote without amendments).
Obama’s request was rebuffed by the US Senate’s Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid.
The new Republican-controlled Senate should act quickly to approve it.
“There is no way we would have completed the NAFTA negotiation without fast track,” according to Hills.
Nobody will negotiate seriously with the US if Congress can cherry-pick amendments.
Former US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recalls Clinton’s horse-trading with congressional Democrats to persuade them to join Republicans in passing NAFTA, overcoming both parties’ protectionist wings.
Obama and the new Republican majority must now decide if they will follow in their predecessors’ footsteps and spark a new era of economic growth.

Still No Exit for Greece
WASHINGTON, DC – Opinion polls in the run-up to Greece’s early general election on January 25 indicate that the left-wing Syriza party is likely to win the largest share of votes.
As a result, Syriza stands to earn a crucial premium under Greek electoral law, according to which the party that gains the most votes is allocated an extra 50 of the parliament’s 300 seats.
In other words, Syriza could come to power, with enormous implications for Greece and Europe.
Syriza is more a coalition than a unified party, meaning that its leader, Alexis Tsipras, must reconcile moderate socialists, including some of his economic advisers, with radical left-wing members.
The implementation and impact of Syriza’s agenda, especially its decisive economic program, will depend on the new government’s ability to maintain support at home and compromise with Greece’s creditors abroad.
Syriza’s economic program rejects the austerity policies supported – or, some might say, imposed – by the so-called “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission). These policies require Greece to maintain a very high primary budget surplus – more than 4% of GDP – for many years to come.
Syriza also plans to demand a substantial reduction in Greece’s foreign debt, the nominal value of which remains very high – close to 170% of GDP.
In fact, the real present value of the debt is much lower, given that most of it is now held by governments or other public entities and carries long maturities and low interest rates.
Nonetheless, repayment “spikes” this year constitute a real short-term challenge.
The problem for Greece is that its creditors may adopt a very tough stance.
This largely reflects the belief that, if a breakdown of negotiations triggers another Greek crisis, the systemic risks to the eurozone and the wider European Union would be far smaller than they were just a few years ago.
The “acute” phase of the euro crisis is over; even if growth remains elusive, financial contagion is no longer viewed as a risk.
After all, private creditors hold only a minimal share of Greek debt nowadays.
In 2010-2012, by contrast, systemically important European banks were exposed, raising the risk of a domino effect that threatened the entire eurozone.
Moreover, a debt reduction in the form of further interest-rate reductions and maturity extensions on foreign government-held debt would not hurt financial markets.
But debt held by the European Central Bank and the IMF could pose a problem. If Greece’s new government does not tread lightly in these discussions, withdrawal of these institutions’ liquidity support for Greek banks could follow.
Despite the lack of significant financial contagion risk, a renewed Greek crisis, stemming from a lasting and serious breakdown of negotiations between the new government and EU institutions, would constitute a major problem for European cooperation.
The absence of financial contagion would not rule out serious political repercussions.
Europe’s political landscape is changing.
Populist parties, both on the far right and the far left, are gaining electoral traction. Some, such as France’s National Front, oppose their country’s eurozone membership; others, such as Podemos in Spain, do not.
Nonetheless, the challenge that these new parties pose to Europe could prove to be extremely disruptive.
A Greek exit from the eurozone, together with financial and political turmoil inside Greece, would be perceived as a major defeat for European integration – especially after the laborious efforts made to hold together the monetary union and, with it, the European dream.
Such an outcome would be even more disheartening in light of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris, and after unity marches in France and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of European solidarity.
A new image of solidarity is precisely what the Greek election should produce.
There is little doubt that the suffering that Greeks have had to endure for the last five years is mainly attributable to the fiscal profligacy and poor public management of a procession of Greek governments.
But as most analysts, including at the IMF, now agree, the troika’s approach was also deeply flawed, as it emphasized wage and income cuts, while neglecting the reform of product markets and the dismantling of harmful public and private oligopolies.
For the sake of Greece and Europe, the new government must work with the European institutions to revise their strategy, while taking responsibility for implementing growth-promoting structural reforms.
Greece’s creditors and partners, for their part, must provide the fiscal space needed for the reforms to work.
Walking away from Greece because it no longer poses a threat of financial contagion is not a politically viable option.
Both sides will have to show more foresight.
The last five years have provided two clear lessons for Europe: procrastination only makes reform more difficult, and the end of financial turmoil does not necessarily mean the end of socioeconomic crisis.
It is time to use these lessons to develop a cooperative strategy that will finally enable Greece to make real progress toward a more stable future.
A Greek exit from the euro is not a more viable solution today than it was three years ago.

Europe’s Double Bind
BERLIN – COVID-19 has made a mockery of the world’s great powers.
US President Donald Trump promised to “make America great again,” but his administration’s handling of the pandemic has been anything but great.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has often spoken of a “Chinese dream,” yet his own response to the crisis has relied on algorithmic authoritarianism.
And Europeans who often pay lip service to multilateralism have met the pandemic with closed borders and national solutions, rather than leading a global response.
In fact, in Europe’s case, COVID-19 is forcing a deeper reckoning.
The post-Cold War dream of a rules-based international order with Europe at the center is in tatters, and the European Union is now being buffeted by both philosophical and geographical shocks.
Philosophically, Europeans are confronting the fact that raw power, not rules, is the main factor determining today’s global dynamics.
Over the past three years, Europeans have watched their two biggest trading partners transform from champions of globalization into the leading exponents of “decoupling.”
Because neither America nor China wants a conventional war, both have taken to weaponizing regional and global institutions.
While the United States has politicized what were once seen as public goods – including the financial system, interbank transfers, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the Internet – the Chinese are increasingly using state aid and strategic investments to manipulate markets and undercut the West in key areas.
The geographic shock is that global politics is now centered around Asia rather than Europe.
During and immediately following the Cold War, Europe’s regional order and the Western-led global order seemed to reinforce one another.
There was a genuine sense of transatlantic community and shared values, with Europe serving as the front line in the US-Soviet competition.
Europe mattered – and successive US presidents were highly attentive to European concerns.
But the Sino-American rivalry has shifted attention away from European issues, and American disengagement in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans has created a vacuum that Turkey and Russia are rushing to fill.
In the 1990s, Europeans assumed that these other powers could be accommodated within the European regional security order, with NATO and the EU serving as the main pillars.
But, particularly during the last decade, the dream of European unipolarity has given way to the realities of multipolarity.
These twin shocks – the abrupt shift from rules to power, and from Europe to Asia – have shaken Europe’s conception of order.
No longer are European plans for regional and global arrangements mutually reinforcing.
Instead of the European legal order being nested within a broader Western security framework, the two domains are now increasingly in conflict with each other.
Europeans thus find themselves in a double bind.
On the one hand, they still depend on the US to uphold the global security order, and sustaining this arrangement seems to require that Europeans assume more responsibility for their regional defense, as well as align closely with America in its confrontation with China.
In the short term, China may well be the glue that holds the transatlantic partnership together, given that Americans and Europeans share many of the same concerns about that country’s state-led economic model and human-rights violations.
But, on the other hand, the global competition between China and the US puts pressure on Europe’s regional order.
The US is increasingly absent from the geopolitical theaters that pose the greatest threat to Europe.
And, under Trump, America no longer bothers to consult European governments on its foreign policy, even concerning countries – like Iraq – where Europe has deployed troops.
Worse, the US has come to regard many of the institutions and rules that were developed for a Europe-centric world as impediments in its confrontation with China.
For example, the Trump administration has essentially made a bonfire out of longstanding multilateral arms-control treaties, on the grounds that these constrain the US while allowing China to do what it wants.
In the coming months, European leaders may be forced to choose between upholding such arrangements and preserving the relationship with the US on security (arms control), the economy (trade rules), technology (5G, semiconductors, etc.), and climate negotiations.
The US presidential election on November 3 could be a game changer in the transatlantic relationship.
A Trump victory would leave Europe even more on its own.
But even if Trump loses to Joe Biden, allowing for a restored transatlantic bargain, the arrival of a new administration would not alter the long-term shift in US priorities, nor would it loosen the American public’s attachment to national sovereignty.
Last year, when French President Emmanuel Macron issued his controversial warning about NATO’s “brain death,” he was channeling a fear that many European leaders privately hold: that the unipolar, Eurocentric, rules-based order is being replaced by a quadrangle of chaos comprising China, Russia, Turkey, and Trump’s America.
In preparing for this possibility, European leaders will have to abandon the notion that geopolitics is a realm of permanent alliances and institutions.
To defend EU values and interests, they will have to assume more diplomatic responsibility for regional security, pursuing a mix of deterrence and dialogue vis-à-vis Russia and Turkey.
In developing a new strategy, the EU will need to make room for a robust military component, even though its foreign-policy strength will continue to depend largely on weaponizing assets such as trade, technology, and regulation.
Instead of asking Germany to increase its defense spending to 2% of GDP, for example, the EU should be asking Germans to use the remaining 98% of their economy as a means of securing European interests in trade and other issues of concern.

A US Inflation Reduction Act for Europe
MANNHEIM – The United States’ recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes hundreds of billions in federal subsidies for green technologies and renewable energies, marks a long-overdue shift in US climate policy.
But while the US decision to join the global fight against climate change has been well received in the European Union, some leaders have voiced concerns that the bill focuses too much on domestic production and might discriminate against EU-based companies.
In a recent policy paper, I argue that Europe should not resist the new US approach to climate policy.
Instead, European countries should welcome it and develop a better version of their own.
One reason Europeans should embrace the IRA is that it goes beyond the somewhat simplistic approach to climate change that often dominates policy discussions.
The EU’s current approach, exemplified by its Fit for 55 initiative, adheres to a market-based paradigm that relies on carbon pricing to ensure self-regulation by emitters.
The IRA, by contrast, assumes that a forward-looking government can accelerate the transition to a green economy through targeted investment subsidies to people and companies.
Moreover, the IRA has a clear pro-worker bent, focusing on domestic employment and attempting to boost wages by making some tax credits conditional on companies’ commitment to pay prevailing wages.
While the IRA represents a green industrial policy with the potential to create millions of good clean-energy jobs, the EU’s market-liberal approach is bound to fail, because the economic theory that underpins it neglects two crucial features of human societies: individual adjustment costs and economic power relationships.
And while European policymakers seem enthralled by the fairytale world of free markets, the IRA’s targeted, government-focused approach is based on sound economic reasoning.
The IRA has the additional advantage of offering a positive narrative.
Pro-market economists’ main policy instrument to make people embrace sustainability is to punish them for environmentally irresponsible behavior.
In addition, the pro-market approach reduces the social dimension of climate policies to transfer payments to the so-called “losers” of the transition to net-zero emissions.
But most people do not enjoy punishment, do not want to receive government handouts, and certainly do not like being called losers.
Most people want a green economy that provides decent, well-paying jobs, and they expect governments to help create the conditions for it.
But while the IRA’s overall approach to climate policy is sound, it does have one major flaw.
Simply put, the US lacks the labor institutions necessary to translate a pro-worker government agenda into actual policy.
Addressing the structural power asymmetry between workers and employers requires well-organized unions, work councils, and stronger enforcement of minimum-wage laws.
Clearly, when it comes to developing a labor-friendly climate agenda, many European countries have an advantage over the US that they can and must leverage.
For starters, the IRA’s concept of “prevailing wage” is somewhat fuzzy and would be difficult to enforce.
In most EU countries, industrial wages are covered by collective-bargaining agreements, and union wages could easily be used as benchmarks in other sectors.
Countries like France and Germany could lead on this issue.
Given that Germany already plans to set a decent-pay condition for all federal contractors this year, applying similar requirements for green investment subsidies does not seem far-fetched.
In addition, worker-training programs must be an integral part of any green agenda.
The IRA aims to support the creation of a high-skilled workforce by offering tax credits to companies that provide apprenticeships.
But the success of these programs depends on the availability of high-quality teaching that works together with employers.
Such arrangements exist only in some parts of the US, whereas Germany and several other EU countries have a long tradition of using apprenticeships and retraining programs to support workers in acquiring the technical skills needed for most industrial jobs.
But industrial policy will do little to boost wages in the service sector, which is why minimum-wage laws are essential to any pro-worker policy agenda.
EU countries must use the green-energy transition as an opportunity to set a fair minimum wage that provides a decent standard of living.
The German government recently took an important step in this direction when it raised the minimum wage from €10.45 to €12 (about $16 in purchasing power parity terms), even though much of this minimum-wage hike will be nullified by high inflation.
In line with the EU’s recent declaration on minimum wages, Germany must raise its minimum wage to at least €16 as soon as possible.
By doing so, it could help push the whole EU toward a robust pro-worker response to the IRA.

Yukos Now, Russia's Economy Later
Just as familiarity breeds contempt, success often spawns complacency.
Sadly, that seems to be the case in Russia, where the government has chosen the first period of prolonged economic growth since communism's fall--with the budget in surplus and capital flight seemingly reversed--to re-open the oligarch wars of the 1990's.
Optimists beware: the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky--and the freezing of his shares in oil giant Yukos--will have a profound long-term impact on Russia's economy and on relations between business and government.
The Yukos imbroglio will not bring Russia's economy to a screeching halt, because no single company determines the country's fate. But long-term prospects are certain to deteriorate.
The problem is one of trust between the business community and the government, which in recent years had just begun to develop.
To put it bluntly, violating that fledgling trust will break the back of Russia's economic upswing.
"Operation Clean Hands"--what some are calling the investigations into Khodorkovsky and his associates--will not increase tax revenue, but only spur growth in the informal economy, as businessmen try to conceal their affairs even more completely from the government.
After all, once Russia's richest man can be stripped of his assets at any moment, ordinary Russian businessmen may be forgiven for concluding that operating in the open is risky.
The first signs of this realization will probably take the form of an increase in capital flight.
Until the Yukos affair, capital flight was reversing.
After a decade of hemorrhaging capital, the first half of this year saw data indicating that Russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at home.
If capital flight resumes, it will quickly snowball if President Putin fails to convince people that the Yukos affair is an isolated case.
I believe that capital flight will increase substantially.
Reduced business activity, with long-term investment projects being cancelled, seems just as certain.
A lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevitable.
Nor am I alone.
Independent Russian economic experts are unanimous in sharing this grim conclusion.
Only people linked to the regime appear to differ.
If investment stalls, President Putin will have no hope of doubling the size of the economy within a decade, as he has promised.
My longstanding skepticism about this promise has now hardened into certainty: the Yukos affair will make it impossible to sustain the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the seizure of his assets has dealt a devastating blow to business confidence.
Indeed, times have changed dramatically since the cutthroat Russian capitalism of the 1990's--supposedly a world in which entrepreneurs were indifferent, at best, to each other's problems.
That caricature, if ever true, is certainly not true today: the business community's negative reaction to the persecution of Khodorkovsky by the law enforcement agencies has been strong and nearly unanimous.
The growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic crime are viewed by the business community as both a mockery of the legal code and a veiled threat that the prosecutors want their cut of Russia's riches.
The improved image of Russia's legal system is in tatters.
Today, the business community understands that the Prosecutor General's Office can find any pretext to go after any one of them.
If prosecutors can treat huge businesses so roughly, what hope is there for medium and small businesses?
No surprise, then, that owners of companies of all sizes are now forming a united front to protect their interests.
President Putin, meanwhile, steadfastly refuses to discuss the Yukos affair or the actions of the law enforcement agencies with Russia's business community.
His silence clearly implies consent to the actions of the prosecutors.
But if the president will not publicly account for the fidelity of Russia's law enforcement agencies to law, who will?
One of the great flaws of Putin's presidency has been to allow law enforcement agencies to evaluate their own actions.
Of course, they invariably conclude that their actions were right and lawful.
So the president's position is clear and he will not back down.
In fact, only businesspeople may now be able to influence events: a sharp and pronounced slowdown, with Russian capital showing its displeasure by voting with its feet, might be the last hope for turning the prosecutors from their chosen course.
But I see no reason for optimism.
On the contrary, the arrest of Khodorkovsky has only whetted the prosecutors' appetite.
Once they have digested Yukos, they will look for another meal.
After that, can anyone seriously doubt that the craving for fresh prey will intensify?

The Two Sides of Chinese GDP
CHICAGO – Economic reporting about China focuses far too much on total GDP and not enough on per capita GDP, which is the more revealing indicator.
And this skewed coverage has important implications, because the two indicators paint significantly different pictures of China’s current economic and political situation.
They also focus our attention on different issues.
A quick search through all English-language news outlets in the ProQuest database for the ten-year period from 2011-21 shows that 20,915 articles discussed China’s GDP, whereas only 1,163 mentioned its GDP per capita.
The difference was proportionally even larger among the eight largest and most elite papers, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post, where 5,963 articles referred to Chinese GDP and only 305 discussed the per capita measure.
In 2019, China’s GDP (measured at market exchange rates) of $14 trillion was the world’s second largest, after that of the United States ($21 trillion), with Japan ($5 trillion) in third place.
Aggregate GDP reflects the total resources – including the tax base – available to a government.
This is helpful for thinking about the size of China’s public investments, such as in its space program or military capacity.
But it has much less bearing on Chinese people’s everyday lives.
Most economists therefore care more about China’s per capita GDP, or income per person, than the aggregate measure.
And the key takeaway here is that China remains a poor country, despite its phenomenal headline GDP growth over the past four decades.
China’s per capita GDP in 2019 was $8,242, placing the country between Montenegro ($8,591) and Botswana ($8,093).
Its per capita GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms – with income adjusted to take account of the cost of living – was $16,804.
This is below the global average of $17,811 and puts China 86th in the world, between Suriname ($17,256) and Bosnia and Herzegovina ($16,289).
In contrast, GDP per capita in PPP terms in the US and the European Union is $65,298 and $47,828, respectively.
To understand the extent of poverty in China, we also need to consider the degree of inequality across its large population.
China’s current level of income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) is similar to that found in the US and India.
Given that 1.4 billion people live in China, the country’s inequality implies that there are still hundreds of millions of impoverished Chinese.
The Chinese government has said that 600 million people have a monthly income of barely CN¥1,000 ($155), equivalent to an annual income of $1,860.
Of these people, 75.6% live in rural areas.
To leave the ranks of the world’s poorest countries, China must significantly boost the incomes of a population about the size of that of Sub-Saharan Africa, and with a similar average income of $1,657.
And the Chinese government is aware that it must do so in order to maintain popular support.
All else being equal, it will be preoccupied for at least another generation by the need to increase domestic incomes.
But all else is rarely equal in politics, and governments can also bolster their popular support in ways that do not foster economic growth.
The Chinese government, for example, emphasizes its role in defending the population against external or impersonal forces, such as earthquakes or the COVID-19 pandemic.
It has also recently adopted an assertive stance regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea and along the Chinese-Indian border.
Western countries have responded to these and other Chinese actions in a variety of ways.
The US is ramping up its military presence in the South China Sea, while China also faces the threat of economic sanctions and a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics because of human-rights concerns.
Experience suggests that sanctions, boycotts, and military pressure are unlikely to achieve their intended aims.
Russia, for example, has faced Western economic sanctions since 2014 – and US President Joe Biden’s administration recently announced further punitive measures – but the Kremlin has persisted in its policy of occupation in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
Likewise, the boycotts of the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the 1984 Games in Los Angeles had little effect on either side in the Cold War.
On the contrary, military aggression often provokes a political backlash in the targeted country and strengthens support for its government.
Economic sanctions can have similar effects and solidify public opinion behind more hardline policies.
The backlash effect is easily observed in China nowadays.
Many Chinese think the West is seeking to reassert political dominance and feel painful reminders of colonialism and World War II, when China lost 20 million people, more than any country except the Soviet Union.
The strong emotions triggered by Western policies toward China overshadow the fact that some of China’s actions are troubling countries like India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which also suffered brutal colonial policies.
These emotional reactions also distract attention from important domestic issues, not least the need to boost incomes.
China’s poor, most of whom probably care little about border disputes or international sporting events, will bear the brunt of any collateral damage.
To engage effectively with China, other countries should remember: contrary to first impressions, it is not an economic monolith.
Behind the world’s second-highest GDP are hundreds of millions of people who just want to stop being poor.

Is Psychiatry Stuck in the Past?
Ever since psychiatry emerged as an independent field of medicine, it has stood in the shadows of other specialties, never progressing scientifically as fast as neurology, oncology, or cardiology.
In many developed countries, the decline of mental hospitals has brought psychiatric services into closer professional contact than ever with these and other medical domains.
Yet psychiatry continues to inhabit medicine's netherworld - within the mainstream clinically, outside it scientifically.
Psychiatry is separated from other medical specialties by its lack of an objective basis for diagnosis.
Other medical fields have refined the diagnostic process to the point where computerized laboratory tests have virtually replaced clinical examination of patients.
Psychiatry remains dependent on interpretation of detailed case histories. These can be obtained only through careful examination and direct questioning of patients.
No universal diagnostic tests exist for the most frequent mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.
Of course, computer programs can now process data derived from patients' symptoms and generate psychiatric diagnoses.
But these apply rules that only replicate the way one or more psychiatrists interpret a patient's symptoms.
There is nothing absolute about the program's output, although it does at least do the same thing every time, which cannot be said for psychiatrists.
After all, interpretations of a case may differ, and the outcome cannot be resolved other than by an appeal to authority - "I am more senior and experienced than you, so my diagnosis takes precedence."
Beyond diagnostic disputes in individual cases, psychiatry's absence of objective diagnostic tests implies something more radical.
The history of the field is littered with definitions of entire disease categories that have been influenced by diagnostic fashions, politics, and the availability of treatments.
Diagnostic fashions reflect prevailing views of what causes mental illness.
From the 1950's to 1980's, for example, psychoanalysis held sway among US psychiatrists.
But the psychoanalytic approach, with its reliance on personal interaction with patients, led to a broad conception of pathology.
During the 1970s, two international studies demonstrated that US psychiatrists diagnosed about twice as many patients as having schizophrenia as psychiatrists in other countries, where psychoanalytic training was relatively uncommon.
The pendulum has since swung in the US, with biological theories of mental disease displacing all other causal contenders.
Parallel to this shift away from psychoanalysis, the diagnosis of schizophrenia has shrunk dramatically, and standard psychiatric practice in the US now incorporates a narrower definition of schizophrenia than is used in Europe.
Psychiatric diagnosis has also been vulnerable to politicization, nowhere more so than in the former Soviet Union, which locked up political dissidents in mental hospitals on what amounted to a charge of schizophrenia.
I once interviewed three former Russian dissidents who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and forcibly treated.
In no case did I find any evidence that they had ever suffered from the disease as it is defined in the West.
Soviet authorities relied on an idiosyncratic definition of schizophrenia, introduced by a professor of psychiatry (A.V. Snezhnevsky) in Moscow.
Anyone who believed that the political system should be changed was suffering from "reformist delusions."
In deference to psychiatry's diagnostic conventions, he emphasized the history of the "condition."
If a dissident demonstrated against the Soviet system at least twice - say, by distributing illicit writings - the "delusions" signified schizophrenia.
But we should not be complacent about the potential for politicization in the West.
In 1987, political pressure in the US led to the elimination of homosexuality as a diagnosis from the nationally accepted guidelines.
In fact, the inclusion of homosexuality as a pathological condition suggests the extent to which psychiatric diagnosis has been shaped by social and political currents.
By contrast, no one - whatever a society's characteristics - has ever seriously questioned whether cancer is a disease.
Moreover, how psychiatrists treat mental illness profoundly influences how it is defined.
Depression is a recent diagnosis - and now one of the most common.
A study of diagnoses from 1949-1969 at the London psychiatric hospital where I work suggests why: a major shift from diagnoses of anxiety to diagnoses of depression coincided with the introduction of the first antidepressant pill.
Psychiatrists began altering their diagnoses to a condition for which they had an effective treatment.
So is psychiatric diagnosis akin to pseudo-science?
International comparisons carried out by the World Health Organization show that as long as psychiatrists from different countries are trained to interview patients using a standardized format, they can agree on who is suffering from schizophrenia.
The WHO studies revealed that schizophrenia defined narrowly - using a particular group of unusual symptoms - occurs with similar frequency throughout the world.
Still, a broad definition produces wide variation in frequency across countries.
Yet defining schizophrenia broadly may be unavoidable, for it is probably not a single disease with a distinct cause.
Indeed, Eugen Bleuler, the Swiss psychiatrist who introduced the term, referred to the condition as "the group of schizophrenias."
Until biological markers for psychiatric illnesses are identified, diagnosis will remain in a 19 th century time warp, relying on the equivalent of broad and outdated medical terms like "fever" and "dropsy."
But patients and their families and friends need not worry excessively.
Most psychiatric treatments are effective across a wide range of diagnoses, whatever their origin.
Psychiatry's success - like that of all medical specialties - should be judged by its ability to relieve human suffering, regardless of disagreements about causes.

Living With the Iran Nuclear Deal
NEW YORK – It is probable that after 60 days of intense debate in Washington, DC, and conceivably Tehran, the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” signed on July 14 by Iran and the UN Security Council’s five permanent members plus Germany (the P5+1), will enter into force.
But no one should confuse this outcome with a solution to the problem of Iran’s nuclear ambitions or its contributions to the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East.
On the contrary, depending on how it is implemented and enforced, the agreement could make matters worse.
This is not to suggest the JCPOA makes no contribution.
It places a ceiling for the next decade on the quantity and quality of centrifuges Iran is allowed to operate and allows the country to possess only a small amount of low-enriched uranium for the next 15 years.
The agreement also establishes, in US President Barack Obama’s words, a “where necessary, when necessary” inspections mechanism that has the potential to verify whether Iran is meeting these and other commitments.
The net result is that the accord should lengthen the period it would take Iran to produce one or more nuclear weapons from several months to as much as a year, making it more likely that such an effort would be discovered in time.
The prospect that the JCPOA could keep Iran without nuclear weapons for 15 years is its main attraction.
Sanctions alone could not have accomplished this, and using military force would have entailed considerable risk with uncertain results.
On the other hand (there always is another hand in diplomacy), the agreement permits Iran to keep far more nuclear-related capacity than it would need if it were interested only in civil research and in demonstrating a symbolic ability to enrich uranium.
The agreement also provides Iran with extensive relief from economic sanctions, which will fuel the regime’s ability to support dangerous proxies throughout the Middle East, back a sectarian government in Baghdad, and prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
Moreover, the accord does not rule out all nuclear-related research and does not constrain work on missiles.
Sales of ballistic missiles and missile parts to Iran are banned for no more than eight years. Sales of conventional arms to Iran are prohibited for no more than five years.
There is also the danger that Iran will fail to comply with parts of the agreement and undertake prohibited work.
Given Iran’s record, this has understandably been the focus of much concern and criticism regarding the pact.
What matters is that non-compliance be met with renewed sanctions and, if needed, military force.
A bigger problem has received much less attention: the risk of what will happen if Iran does comply with the agreement.
Even without violating the accord, Iran can position itself to break out of nuclear constraints when the agreement’s critical provisions expire.
At that point, there will be little to hold it back except the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a voluntary agreement that does not include penalties for non-compliance.
It is important that the United States (ideally, joined by other countries) let Iran know that any action to put itself in a position to field nuclear weapons after 15 years, though not explicitly precluded by the accord, will not be tolerated.
Harsh sanctions should be reintroduced at the first sign that Iran is preparing a post-JCPOA breakout; this, too, is not precluded by the accord.
Iran should likewise be informed that the US and its allies would undertake a preventive military strike if it appeared to be attempting to present the world with a fait accompli.
The world erred in allowing North Korea to pass the nuclear-weapons threshold; it should not make the same mistake again.
In the meantime, a major effort must be launched to assuage the concerns of Iran’s neighbors, several of which will be tempted to hedge their bets against Iran’s potential breakout in 15 years by pursuing nuclear programs of their own.
The Middle East is already nightmarish enough without the added risks posed by a number of would-be nuclear powers.
Obama’s claim that the agreement has “stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region” is premature, at best.
It will also be essential to rebuild strategic trust between the US and Israel; indeed, this will need to be a high priority for Obama’s successor.
And the US should push back as warranted against Iran’s foreign policy or treatment of its own people.
None of this rules out selective cooperation with Iran, be it in Afghanistan, Syria, or Iraq, if interests overlap.
But here, too, realism should prevail.
The notion that the nuclear agreement will lead Iran to moderate its radicalism and rein in its strategic ambitions should not be anyone’s baseline scenario.
In fact, the emergence of an ever more capable Iran, not a transformed one, is likely to be one of the main challenges confronting the Middle East, if not the world, in the coming years.

Disrupting Putin’s Game Plan
MUNICH – No sooner did the Sochi Winter Games end than Russia bade farewell to the Olympic spirit by invading and occupying a foreign country.
With its aggression against Ukraine, the Kremlin has breached the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and other international agreements, including the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and the Black Sea basing agreement, which spelled out Russia’s relations with Ukraine.
Crimea has been turned into a military zone, and its inhabitants might soon find themselves trapped in the firing line if the crisis continues to escalate.
Russians now face international diplomatic and economic isolation, thus exacerbating their country’s economic woes.
And Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reckless gamble risks dragging the world into a wider conflict.
In light of Putin’s dangerous behavior, the West must rethink its stance toward him.
Here is a leader who read a hidden, menacing agenda into a technical European Union document about export subsidies and anti-fraud provisions.
More broadly, here is a paranoiac who sees an implausible coalition of liberal Russians, Ukrainian fascists, the CIA, and Islamist terrorists trying to thwart his preferences, if not topple him, at every turn.
Indeed, what we are seeing is not an unfortunate over-reaction to recent events, but a result of meticulous preparation.
Armies do not mobilize 150,000 troops within days, or have vehicles and thousands of uniforms without insignias ready, or hold military exercises in peaceful regions of the world without warning.
It would be a mistake for NATO to respond to Russia’s provocations with similar saber rattling.
After all, the United States and the EU still have a range of tools to modify Putin’s calculus, or that of those bankrolling his regime.
Most important, the US and Europe must cooperate much more closely than they have so far.
The impression of disunity on sanctions plays into Putin’s hands.
Some EU members, like Germany, must live up to the expectations they have recently raised.
If German leaders are serious about instituting a “culture of responsibility,” they are obliged to act accordingly, even if doing so entails economic costs.
The West should also listen carefully to Ukraine’s neighbor, Poland, which probably has the deepest insight into the complexities of the crisis.
Most important, it is essential to adhere to certain key principles:
Use diplomacy. Europe, the US, and Japan have already suspended their cooperation with Russia in the G-8.
Similarly, the OECD should put Russia’s accession process on hold.
Following punitive measures by the US, the EU has now decided on some “soft” sanctions.
But modest steps like suspending talks on visa liberalization will not impress the Kremlin much.
Stronger signals, such as cancellation or suspension of agreements concerning the South Stream gas pipeline and a trade embargo on arms and dual-use items, merit serious consideration.
Impose targeted sanctions against those responsible for Russia’s Crimean incursion.
An obvious tool here is to broaden the US Magnitsky Act, which prohibits the 18 people identified as being directly responsible for the detention, abuse, and death of the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky from entering the US or using its financial system.
The Magnitsky Act should be amended to include the names of political and military leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine.
Moreover, the modified bill should be adopted by the US and the EU simultaneously – thus delivering a credible threat to freeze the foreign assets of Russia’s government, state-owned companies, individual officials, and relevant oligarchs.
Engage Russians. The West needs to communicate to ordinary Russians the spuriousness of Putin’s zero-sum, us-versus-them narrative.
Closer relations between Ukraine and the EU pose no threat to Russia; on the contrary, a Ukraine closely integrated with its Western neighbors could boost Russia’s economy as well.
That may be irrelevant to a leader who is guided by visions of restored imperial glory, but not to the people under his rule.
Knocking holes in the Kremlin’s wall of propaganda will not be easy, but it should not be impossible in our hyper-connected world.
Support Ukraine with financial aid – as the EU has now done –and by securing its upcoming elections. Military assistance should include, at a minimum, Western intelligence sharing and cooperation through the NATO-Ukraine Commission.
Should the situation deteriorate further, the West should also provide medical aid and surveillance assets.
If the 2008 Russo-Georgian war is any guide, NATO’s Cyber Defense Center should help Ukraine prepare for a large-scale digital offensive.
Defend NATO allies. NATO should discuss concrete steps to protect its members.
Ukraine borders four NATO members (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania), while a fifth (Turkey), along with Romania, borders the Black Sea.
Moreover, Estonia and Latvia are alarmed at Russia’s geopolitical ambitions, especially given the pretext of protecting ethnic kin.
Both have populations that are about 25% Russian – a legacy of their Soviet past.
Finally, Poland and Lithuania border Kaliningrad, Russia’s exclave in the middle of Europe (and the scene of its most recent combat-readiness exercise).
This is a time for diplomacy, and NATO must try to avoid direct confrontation, but not at all costs.
It must reckon that Russia’s actions might deliberately run counter to a peaceful settlement.
The alliance cannot afford to launch a lengthy and heated debate about the deployment of its forces and capabilities only at the moment diplomatic efforts fail.
When Ukrainians stood up against their corrupt elite, they became the first people to put their lives on the line for the goal of EU membership.
The result was unwarranted retaliation from Russia.
So this is not Ukraine’s war.
Ukraine is the immediate victim, but it is by no means Putin’s ultimate target.
This is a blatant attack on the principles of state sovereignty, inviolability of negotiated borders, and adherence to multilateral agreements that underpin today’s rule-based international system.
Countering Russia’s aggression is thus the responsibility of all who would uphold that system.

The Rouhani Factor
PALO ALTO – Iran’s presidential election on May 19 was paradoxical and potentially pivotal.
It began as a sleepy affair – a likely victory for the incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, running against a motley crew of conservative has-beens or upstarts.
Moreover, a two-term presidency has been the default in the Islamic Republic since 1981.
Early attacks on Rouhani were thus seen as efforts by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his conservative clerical allies, and the Revolutionary Guards to weaken and contain the incumbent in his second term.
But then the election became a heated contest, as the conservatives coalesced around a dark horse candidate, Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline jurist with a history of brutality against the opposition.
The fact that Khamenei had earlier named Raisi to head the largest religious endowment in Iran was now seen not as a sinecure, but as a move to position him as a possible future Supreme Leader.
It was widely believed that a win for Raisi would virtually guarantee his success in the eventual battle to succeed Khamenei, who himself had been President when he was catapulted to the position of Supreme Leader, following the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
With Khamenei reported to be suffering from cancer, the question of succession has become acute.
As a result, the conservatives’ considerable ideological, institutional, and propaganda apparatus was mobilized in favor of Raisi, and against Rouhani.
In response, the hitherto careful and pragmatic Rouhani threw caution to the wind and unabashedly embraced the reform movement’s criticisms of the status quo.
The grassroots of Iran’s reform and democratic movement – students, women, artists, and Iran’s quietly relentless civil society – swung into action and turned the election into a surprisingly heated referendum on the country’s future.
Social media were widely used by both sides.
Supporters of Rouhani used online platforms not only to mobilize voters, but also to fact-check Raisi’s proposals and expose his past actions in suppressing the opposition.
More than once, Rouhani supporters subtly referred to the question of succession, by suggesting that the election was about Iran’s fortunes for the next 40 years.
Conservatives used both social media and their control of Iranian radio and television to highlight the dire economic situation and Rouhani’s unfulfilled promises that all international sanctions would be lifted after Iran agreed in 2015 to the nuclear deal with the United Nations (and by extension, the United States).
As a result, it became clear that two competing political paradigms were fighting for the soul of the Islamic Republic.
The conservatives are animated by a desire to maintain their grip on Iran’s state-dominated economy; a preference for pious managers over technocrats; aversion to globalism; a proclivity to align Iran with Russia (and China) against the West, especially the US; persistent pursuit of Shia power by expanding Iran’s support for the likes of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah in Lebanon; antipathy toward cultural openness; and persistent misogyny.
In the past three elections, this paradigm has usually managed to gain 15-17 million votes.
(The only exception was the widely disputed 2009 election, in which the conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad supposedly received more than 25 million votes, giving the world the “miracle” of his second term.)
In order to increase his share of the vote, Raisi promised to triple the monthly cash subsidies paid by the government to virtually every citizen.
The reformist paradigm, by contrast, advocates a more open society; a government managed by competent technocrats; an end to crony capitalism; a vigorous effort to attract foreign direct investment; less censorship; a more conciliatory relationship with Iran’s vast and powerful diaspora; and greater equality for women and marginalized religious and ethnic minorities.
They also dismiss the idea of increasing cash subsidies as economically foolhardy and fiscally unaffordable.
Some 40 million of Iran’s 55 million eligible voters – nearly 73% – went to the polls, often braving long lines.
Twenty-five million of those 40 million (62.5%) voted for the reformist paradigm, delivering a landslide victory to Rouhani.
At the same time, reformist candidates for city councils scored major victories throughout the country.
In Tehran, for example, the reformist slate won every seat, ensuring that the current mayor – himself a conservative presidential candidate – will soon be out of a job.
Even in Meshed, Raisi’s hometown and a bastion of conservative clerical power, a reformist woman candidate won more votes than any male.
And yet, if the past is any indication, Rouhani’s decisive victory does not mean the end of conservative power.
Khamenei, relying on the Revolutionary Guards, has a disproportionate share of power.
In any case, Iran’s future trajectory will be determined not only by Rouhani and the conservative camp, but also by regional developments and the policy adopted by US President Donald Trump’s administration.
In the 1980s, the US did not formulate its policy toward the Soviet bloc without careful consideration of political developments there.
It would be folly for the US to formulate policy on Iran and the Middle East without giving domestic developments there the attention they deserve.

A Global Accord for Sustainable Finance
FRANKFURT – The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the largest decrease in global economic activity on record.
But the drop in carbon dioxide emissions has been only temporary. Although global CO2 emissions fell by 6.4% overall in 2020, they had already begun to increase in the second half of the year and have now returned to pre-crisis levels.
The fact that last year’s extraordinary circumstances still did not bring global emissions into line with the targets set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement is a stark reminder of the scale of the challenge we face.
As the Nobel laureate economist William Nordhaus reminds us, climate change is the quintessential global externality.
Its effects are spread around the world and no country has sufficient incentives or capacity to solve the problem on its own.
International coordination is therefore essential.
Fortunately, a return to multilateral cooperation through the G7, the G20, and the Financial Stability Board offers a unique window of opportunity.
Following US President Joe Biden’s decision to rejoin the Paris agreement, the European Union’s commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and China’s pledge to do the same by 2060, we may now be at a turning point for global climate action.
Three priorities stand out on the international agenda.
The first is the need to increase global carbon prices.
Putting a higher price on carbon is the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions at the necessary scale and speed.
By internalizing the social cost of emissions – making emitters pay – carbon pricing leverages the power of markets to steer economic activities away from carbon-intensive activities.
Currently, carbon prices are far too low.
The International Monetary Fund calculates that the average global carbon price is only $2 per ton.
And, according to the World Bank, only 5% of global greenhouse-gas emissions are priced within the range required to achieve the Paris agreement’s goals.
Here, advanced economies can lead by example and use the current policy window to commit to carbon-price paths consistent with the Paris accord.
Although smaller advanced economies account for only a limited share of global emissions, their adoption of decisive decarbonization measures could encourage developing countries to follow suit.
The second priority is to use the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to “build back better.”
Decisions made now will shape the climate trajectory for decades to come.
Policymakers should seize this opportunity to set the global economy on a sustainable growth path.
The EU recovery package – Next Generation EU – lives up to that ambition.
The third priority goes to the heart of the financial system and central banking: financing the green transition.
Phasing out fossil fuels implies the need for massive investment, even if estimates of the precise figure are subject to significant uncertainty.
Looking beyond emissions reductions to the broader sustainability agenda, the United Nations estimates that implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda will require global investments of $5-7 trillion per year.
To fill this gap, it will be crucial to mobilize the resources of financial intermediaries, including banks.
Sustainable-finance products – such as green lending, green and sustainable bonds, and funds with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics – have grown dramatically in recent years.
Unfortunately, the field suffers from information asymmetries and insufficient transparency.
To foster the growth of sustainable finance, many countries have started developing regulatory frameworks to combat “greenwashing,” and the EU is at the forefront of these efforts.
Yet in the absence of global coordination, different jurisdictions have developed different approaches, and industry-based initiatives have proliferated.
The resulting edifice of inconsistent and incomparable standards, definitions, and metrics has fragmented sustainable-finance markets, reducing their efficiency and limiting the cross-border availability of capital for green investment.
As jurisdictions compete to attract finance, the risk of regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom has grown.
If left unaddressed, this trend could result in lower standards globally, increasing the likelihood of greenwashing.
But we now have an opportunity to start devising a common global approach.
Sustainable finance is a top priority for both the G20 under its Italian presidency and the G7 under its British presidency.
Moreover, in a public letter shortly after her confirmation, US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen called for an upgrade to the G20’s sustainable-finance working group to “reflect its importance.”
A key first step is to agree on minimum standards for corporate disclosures.
If a company’s sustainability performance is unclear or unknown, ascertaining the sustainability of the related financial assets is impossible.
We must replace the current alphabet soup of reporting frameworks with a common standard.
To that end, the EU’s approach – including the ongoing revision of the Corporate Sustainability Financial Reporting Directive – represents an advanced benchmark toward which any international standard should aim.
For a common standard to launch a race to the top, it must not fall short of the best international practices.
It should cover all ESG aspects of sustainability.
And it should require companies to disclose not just issues that influence enterprise value, but also information on the company’s broader environmental and social impact (known as “double materiality”).
A second and even greater challenge is to ensure that countries develop consistent classifications of what counts as sustainable investment.
If an activity or asset is considered sustainable in one country but unsustainable in another, there cannot be a truly global sustainable-finance market.
To ensure a global level playing field, today’s leaders should aim for an agreement on common principles for well-functioning and globally coherent taxonomies.
Just as governments need to be mindful of the risk of carbon leakage, they must account for the risk of carbon financing leakage.
Finally, we need to ensure that all segments of financial activity remain aligned with broader climate objectives.
The enormous energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions of crypto-asset mining could undermine global sustainability efforts.
Bitcoin alone is already consuming more electricity than the Netherlands.
Controlling and limiting the environmental impact of crypto assets, including through regulation and taxation, should be part of the global discussion.
Climate change and sustainability are global challenges that require global solutions – and nowhere more so than in the financial sector.
The current political environment offers us a rare opportunity to make substantial progress.
We must not waste it.

Is Europe Turning Toward A Strong Euro?
Is this a sign that the tide is turning in Europe in favor of a stronger euro? Or does it simply reflect the fact that the ECB now is reverting to its old policy of not commenting on exchange rates whatever the circumstance?
The answer may come clearer at the June meeting next Thursday when the appreciating euro undoubtedly will be brought up once again at the press conference.
Two factors point to a possible turning of the tide.
One is the fact that crude oil is heading towards $75 a barrel or higher. Second, Europe’s economic recovery is progressing to the point where exports are no longer the sole source of growth.
Indeed, with sky-high prices of crude oil and base metals like copper, aluminum, and zinc, the rising euro has become a shield for Europe’s ongoing economic recovery.
These commodities, after all, are priced in US dollars.
Because the euro has appreciated against the dollar, the euro price of crude oil and base metals has increased at a slower pace than their corresponding dollar prices.
As the escalation of dollar commodity prices continues, so will Europe’s appreciation of its stronger currency.
The recently rising euro also has helped keep down European long-term interest rates — a key determinant of economic activity — as inflationary expectations deteriorated somewhat in the euro-zone area.
During April, the rise in inflationary expectations and the euro’s appreciation occurred more or less concurrently.
The yield on the 10-year German bond, which might have been expected to go higher because of the deterioration in inflationary expectations during this period, barely moved.
This is a big plus for sustaining economic recovery.
Should Bush, Bernanke or the new Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson cause investors to lose faith in US financial assets at some point in time, the rising euro will help shield European interest rates from the consequences.
Still, politicians and maybe even some central bankers continue to be concerned about the currency, because they fear that a stronger euro could stifle exports, thus weakening overall economic performance.
But this fear is likely to diminish as Europe’s recovery broadens past exports into the economy’s domestic sectors.
In fact, there is evidence that this is now happening.
Surveys show that business confidence is up throughout the euro-zone economy, indicating that a domestic investment boom may be around the corner.
Likewise, the new ECB growth forecasts may show the internal economy strengthening.
In short, the fear that a stronger euro could kill the only goose laying the golden eggs is likely to recede in coming months.
Of course, not everyone in Europe can be expected to be equally enthusiastic about a stronger euro.
The euro zone is a vast area comprised of different nations with different cultures, histories, economies, politics, and so forth.
Germany, with its history of a strong deutsche mark and very competitive costs, likes the strong euro more than, say, its partners, France and Italy, which have histories of weak domestic currencies and non-competitive export costs.
The mere existence of a common currency is no guarantee that everyone will agree about what its value should be.
Still, even in the traditionally weak-currency countries, changes afoot suggest that a turnaround in political attitudes and public opinion toward a stronger euro may be on the horizon.
The recent election in Italy of a center-left government led by Romano Prodi is a case in point.
Not only did the Northern League – an important component of Silvio Berlusconi’s ousted right-wing coalition – favor a weak euro, but it also favored pulling Italy out of the euro altogether.
Now it is out of power.
So is Berlusconi himself, who favored a weak euro to compensate for Italy’s economic inefficiency and the complete lack of reform during his years in office.
Prodi, a convinced European, is less likely to favor a weak euro.
Another promising change in Italy has been the appointment of Mario Draghi as Governor of the Bank of Italy.
Draghi, a respected MIT economist, favors economic reform and understands the role that a strong euro plays in spurring it.
Economic reform must be financed somehow, and if the funds are to come, at least in part, from outside the EU, the euro must be a strong currency.
Draghi replaced Antonio Fazio, whose corrupt protectionist practices in Italy’s banking sector had both discouraged capital from coming into Italy and depressed the euro.
In the current global environment, the case for the strong euro is becoming increasingly apparent.
Mr. Trichet’s silence at the May ECB press conference on the rising euro could be a tacit acknowledgement of this new reality.
We should learn more at next week’s June meeting.

China and the Sovereign-Debt Bomb
WASHINGTON, DC – International capital flows have long been a major source of economic growth.
Savings in higher-income countries have financed high-yielding investments in low-income countries, generating benefits for all.
After World War II, capital flows under the Marshall Plan drove the rapid reconstruction of Europe, and after those countries recovered, they extended their own foreign aid and other official financial flows to the developing world.
Private financing also increased substantially; by the 1990s, it accounted for over half of total capital flows to developing countries.
Some of these flows led to spectacular results.
South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world in the 1950s, with a savings rate of only 3% of GDP.
But after implementing major policy reforms, it was able to avail itself of large capital inflows to finance investments with very high rates of return.
It has since become an advanced economy.
High savings and investment rates mean it has no difficulty servicing its debt.
But not all low-income countries have pursued macroeconomic and other policies that are conducive to growth.
Many have borrowed to cover balance-of-payments deficits and other problems, depleting their foreign-exchange reserves and jeopardizing their access to private capital markets.
For decades, the international community addressed these problems through the International Monetary Fund and an informal arrangement among official (government) creditors known as the Paris Club.
When an indebted country ran into trouble, the IMF stepped in to provide short-term financing and recommend policy reforms designed to put the economy back on a sustainable growth path.
Once the Fund and the debtor-country government had agreed on a reform program, the Paris Club creditors could negotiate a reduction of the existing official bilateral debt to make it sustainable.
Implicit in this process was that private creditors also must agree to a similar “haircut.”
Otherwise, the IMF’s bailout funds would end up being used to service the country’s debts to the private sector, rather than for restoring economic activity.
Although this system for managing crises was far from perfect, it generally worked.
But the situation has changed markedly in the past two decades, during which China has become a major lender to developing countries.
As of 2022, the world’s 74 lowest-income countries had debt-service obligations totaling $35 billion, with $13.1 billion – 37% – owed to China.
According to a May 2021 Peterson Institute for International Economics policy brief, China accounts for over 50% of all debt owed by poor countries to official creditors.
China’s emergence as a leading creditor has created problems, not least because it has refused an invitation to join the Paris Club.
While Paris Club members share information about the sums owed to them, China does not.
Nor has it been willing to participate meaningfully in multilateral debt-restructuring arrangements.
Instead, it has operated as a black box, attaching nondisclosure agreements to many of its loans, and funneling credit through a wide range of agencies.
In 2020, the G20 – which includes China – agreed on a Common Framework for addressing debt distress in developing countries.
But there has been little additional progress since then.
This month, Ghana became only the fourth country to apply for support under the facility.
Meanwhile, the number of countries facing serious debt-servicing issues has continued to grow.
Zambia and Sri Lanka have already defaulted on their loans, and their economies are in deep recession.
While Sri Lanka – along with Malawi – has tentatively accepted the terms of a new IMF program, the agreement cannot be signed (or the funds disbursed) until the debt is made sustainable.
But when the existing debt level is unsustainable, the IMF cannot approve the loan without all significant creditors agreeing to a restructuring.
The resulting paralysis has put many other poor countries in danger.
Tunisia cannot meet its budget without international bond financing.
Ghana, already struggling under a heavy debt load, was forced in November to issue a six-month treasury bill with a ruinous 36% interest rate.
Pakistan, after being devastated by floods last summer, has foreign-exchange reserves equal to only a month’s imports – well below a level deemed safe.
And these are just a few of the countries with debt levels that are, or are likely to become, unsustainable.
Without international help, these highly indebted countries will be confronted with ongoing shortages of electricity, fuel, and other essentials (as we saw in Sri Lanka last year), leading to economic stagnation or decline.
As more countries fall into this trap, humanitarian crises and sharp increases in poverty will follow.
It is in everyone’s interest to find ways to ensure debt restructuring, along with the necessary economic policy reforms, for countries in dire need.
A renewed push on this issue could produce an agreement between China and other creditor countries to the benefit of all.
The most promising route, given the IMF’s crucial role in supporting macroeconomic policy reforms, would be to grant the Fund greater authority to deem debt unsustainable.
Failure to get ahead of the developing world’s looming debt crises would represent a moral failure, and would also greatly dampen world economic growth, as it would induce greater pressure for protection in advanced countries and spur greater resistance to reforms in developing countries.
The result would be prolonged stagnation and depression in debt-ridden economies, with huge humanitarian costs.

The Wild West of Electronic Waste
IRVINE , CALIFORNIA – One Troy ounce (31 grams) of gold is now selling for approximately $1,150 on the open market. The equivalent weight of platinum sells for $1,450.
High prices encourage more mining, but they don’t begin to cover the cost to human health – and to the earth itself.
For example, thousands of children in China’s Henan Province are sick from lead poisoning, because they live near a facility operated by Henan Yuguang Gold ampamp; Lead Company, one of the world’s largest mining conglomerates.
But high prices are also encouraging many more people to extract precious metals from existing products – at great danger to themselves and others.
Indeed, the world’s population throws away nearly 10 ounces of gold and five ounces of platinum for every ton of cell phones that are discarded in landfills or incinerated.
Other precious metals that are teased from the Earth, including indium, gallium, palladium, and ruthenium, are being discarded in much the same way as other electronic waste (e-waste).
So is tantalum, the essential constituent of the capacitors used in cell phones.
Approximately 37% of the world’s supply of tantalum comes from Central Africa, where mining it has been linked to devastating wars and environmental pollution.
It can be argued that disposing of high-tech e-waste in landfills is just another way of returning these precious metals to the earth, where, millennia from now, it will have merged with the substrata, becoming just like any other ore.
But, along with the precious metals, e-waste also contains potent toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants.
The short-term consequences of using landfills, shallow pits, or incinerators to get rid of e-waste is the release of these noxious chemicals, which adversely impact ecological processes, wildlife, and human health.
For more than a decade, the precious metallic component of e-waste has been fueling a polarized international trade in potentially hazardous materials, with defunct electronic products exported to countries where labor is cheap. There, the prospect of recovering a fraction of an ounce of gold or platinum entices communities to discount heavily the toxic risks and health effects of chronic exposure.
Compounding this problem is the diversity of national and international regulatory policies in place or being developed to manage e-waste.
The lack of consensus on the magnitude of the problem, and gaps in legislative coverage, only serves to deepen the holes into which vulnerable populations stumble while attempting to make a living through artisanal e-waste mining.
The Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal was meant to level the playing field between countries that produce toxic waste and those that potentially consume it.
Essentially, it sought to neutralize sentiments such as those expressed in a memo attributed to Lawrence Summers, former Harvard President and now Director of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council: “I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.”
The Basel Convention, now 20 years old, has struggled to keep up with new technologies, unpredictable loopholes, and clandestine economic transactions involving hazardous waste.
At its inception, no one could have predicted that within two decades, electronic products would become a 50-million-ton global problem looking for local solutions.
If sustainable solutions to the global e-waste problem are to be found, conscientious international cooperation will be needed. This is because the problem permeates the entire life cycle of electronic products, from the mining of raw materials to the occupational hazards associated with manufacturing and product assembly and the disposal of outdated or broken products.
In the current global market, the life cycle of an electronic device may include the synthesis of labor and material from a dozen or more countries.
Most proposals for managing e-waste fall into one of two major categories.
Some would manage e-waste at one of the handful of sophisticated smelters that can recover precious metals from discarded electronic devices.
For example, The Umicore Group in Belgium advertises itself as the world’s largest recycler of electronic scrap, mobile phones, and laptop computers.
For numerous reasons, not every country can afford to build smelting facilities that operate at the level claimed by Umicore.
Hence, this strategy will require some cross-border shipment of e-waste.
The major challenge, however, is the difficult work of collecting unwanted devices at the street level, and sorting and coordinating collected items for international distribution and processing.
The second major category of e-waste management strategies is to decentralize recycling while keeping the environmental impact of small-scale facilities to an acceptable level.
In a way, this is already happening through cottage industries in countries such as China, Ghana, India, and Nigeria, which employ ill-equipped artisans who are not sufficiently trained to avoid harmful procedures that contaminate the environment and sicken themselves and their neighbors.
To work effectively, electronics manufacturers must assume some responsibility for training recyclers, in developing small-scale facilities that can operate at the regional level, and in working with regulators to ensure appropriate safety and environmental monitoring schemes for such operations.
Ultimately, effective strategies for managing e-waste require the development of local infrastructures, aggressive coordination of community participation, and international regulations that encourage sustainable manufacturing practices without stifling innovation.

Embracing Science
Long-term economic progress comes mainly from the invention and spread of improved technologies.
The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India’s escape from famine by increased farm yields – the so-called “Green Revolution.”
Today’s era of globalization emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet.
Thus, when we seek solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems, they, too, are likely to be found, at least in part, in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems.
Consider poverty in Africa.
Every conceivable explanation has been given, usually focusing on what Africans do wrong.
But a visit to Africa’s villages makes clear that the problems have more to do with the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies.
Africa’s farmers produce roughly one-third or less food per hectare of farmland than their counterparts around the world, resulting in massive hunger, which is exacerbated by a heavy disease burden.
Malaria poses a unique challenge, owing in large part to Africa’s mosquito species, which are especially adept at transmitting the disease.
Other tropical parasitic diseases imply similarly extraordinary burdens in Africa.
Add the practical difficulties of broken-down roads and few cars and trucks, and economic isolation follows.
So the challenges of survival are enormous.
Yet practical solutions are at hand, because simple and low-cost technologies can address specific problems.
Low farm yields can be addressed through improved seed varieties specially adapted for African conditions, combined with technologies for replenishing soil and managing water.
Malaria can be controlled through newly designed long-lasting mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines.
Other tropical diseases also can be controlled, and practical technologies for safe drinking water can dramatically reduce diarrheal diseases.
Mobile phones, local wireless Internet, and more paved roads could do much to break the economic isolation of Africa’s villages.
Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies, government institutions, public administration, and more.
Some of these changes are important, but the role of the rich countries has been lopsided, focusing on everything except how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems.
The rich countries’ mistakes wouldn’t matter if African countries had enough money to adopt the needed technologies on their own, but Africa is so poor that it must get financial help to escape poverty.
The development challenges in Africa are just one example of how tough societal problems can be addressed by the design and spread of improved technologies.
The same will be true of how the world best addresses manmade climate change – another of those seemingly intractable global problems.
Right now, rich countries are changing the world’s climate by emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year from the use of coal, oil, and natural gas.
In future years, China and India also will make massive contributions to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Yet no country, rich or poor, is keen to cut its energy use, owing to concern that to do so would threaten jobs, incomes, and economic growth.
New technologies will provide a key part of the solution.
Already, “hybrid” automobiles, which combine gasoline and battery power, can roughly double fuel efficiency, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by half.
Similarly, engineers have developed ways to capture the carbon dioxide that results from burning coal in power plants and store it safely underground.
This new technology, called “carbon capture and sequestration,” can cut by 80% the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of electricity.
The costs appear relatively small.
Consider also the depletion of ocean fisheries through over-fishing.
Global demand for fish consumption is growing, and so, too, is the global capacity to catch fish, driving some species to the point of extinction.
Improved aquaculture, in which fish are grown at manmade fishponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology, mainly for environmental reasons, yet it is enormously promising.
On a recent visit to Africa, a senior agricultural scientist said that in today’s world, the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer, but farther away than ever from the policymakers.
Politicians don’t understand science, and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers in addressing major issues.
Everything is viewed as politics and votes, not as technical problems requiring technological expertise, which is why Africa’s poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to ecological challenges.
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can save the day.
After all, technological advance also requires good governance, market forces, effective universities, and more.
Politics will still play its role.
Nevertheless, it’s time to recognize that governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities facing the world, and that new ways are needed to ensure that science and technology are given the prominence needed to address a wide range of increasingly urgent global problems.
Now is the time for every major international agency and national government to assume responsibility for gaining the scientific and technological expertise that they will need in the twenty-first century.

The Tyranny of King Cotton
Americans like to think that if poor countries simply open up their markets, greater prosperity will follow.
Unfortunately, where agriculture is concerned, this is mere rhetoric.
The United States pays only lip service to free market principles, favoring Washington lobbyists and campaign contributors who demand just the opposite.
Indeed, it is America’s own agricultural subsidies that helped kill, at least for now, the so-called Doha Development Round of trade negotiations that were supposed to give poor countries new opportunities to enhance their growth.
Subsidies hurt developing country farmers because they lead to higher output – and lower global prices.
The Bush administration – supposedly committed to free markets around the world – has actually almost doubled the level of agricultural subsidies in the US.
Cotton illustrates the problem.
Without subsidies, it would not pay for Americans to produce much cotton; with them, the US is the world’s largest cotton exporter.
Some 25,000 rich American cotton farmers divide $3 to $4 billion in subsidies among themselves – with most of the money going to a small fraction of the recipients.
The increased supply depresses cotton prices, hurting some 10 million farmers in sub-Saharan Africa alone.
Seldom have so few done so much damage to so many.
That damage is all the greater when we consider how America’s trade subsidies contributed to the demise of the Doha Round.
Rather than offering to do away with its cotton subsidies, America offered to open up American markets to cotton imports – an essentially meaningless public-relations move that quickly backfired.
Owing to its huge subsidies, America exports cotton, and it would import little even if formal barriers are removed.
Thus, recent trade negotiations have a surreal air about them, because, whatever their outcome, ultimately cotton subsidies will have to go.
Brazil, frustrated with America’s intransigence, brought a case against US cotton subsidies before the WTO, which ruled as almost any economist would: the subsidies distort world trade and are therefore prohibited.
Faced with the WTO order, the US will try to comply with the letter of the law and avoid its spirit, making changes in the subsidy program to ensure “technical” compliance.
But these attempts will almost surely fail; in the end – though it may take years – cotton subsidies will be eliminated.
Of course, the European Union’s subsidies are far larger, but, in contrast to the US, Europe has made some effort to reduce them, especially export subsidies.
While export subsidies appear more obviously “trade distorting,” America’s cotton and other subsidies are in fact almost as bad.
When subsidies lead to increased production with little increase in consumption, as is typical with agricultural commodities, higher output translates directly into higher exports, which translate directly into lower prices for producers, lower incomes for farmers, and more poverty in the Third world, including millions of cotton farmers eking out subsistence incomes in semi-arid conditions.
America and other advanced countries are the real losers from the demise of the Doha Round.
Had the Bush administration fulfilled its commitments, Americans taxpayers would have benefited from the elimination of huge agricultural subsidies – a real boon in this era of yawning budget deficits.
Americans would have been better off as consumers, too, with increased access to a variety of low-cost goods from poor countries.
Likewise, migration pressure would have been reduced, because it is the huge disparity in incomes more than anything else that leads people to leave their homes and families to immigrate to the US.
A fair trade regime would have helped reduce that disparity.
Indeed, citizens throughout the rich developed world all stand to benefit from a more prosperous globe – especially a world in which there is less poverty, with fewer people facing despair.
For we all suffer from the political instability to which such despair gives rise.
But it is America that perhaps now stands to gain the most by reviving the Doha talks with a more credible and generous offer.
America’s influence in the world has suffered greatly in the last few years; the Bush administration’s hypocritical use of free-market rhetoric while pursuing protectionist policies has made matters worse.
America’s national interests thus dictate a change of policy.
But there is also another powerful rationale for doing so: treating fairly those who are poorer and less powerful is the morally right thing to do.

Germany's Europeanized Malaise
PRINCETON – The razor-thin outcome of the German election marks a watershed in the history of the Federal Republic, signaling the final disintegration of the near-two-party system that long characterized the politics of West Germany and then of reunified Germany after 1990.
Together, the old two dominant parties, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), have secured only around half of the vote.
The result suggests that Germany has undergone a new degree of Europeanization, acquiring some of the most destructive features of politics in neighboring countries.
The upshot is that fragmentation and paranoia will now dominate German political life.
Western European politics in the post-war period rested on the alternation between center-right (Christian Democratic) and center-left (social democratic) parties.
The parties representing these two broad positions were necessarily centrist, because they had to compete for what political scientists call the “median voter.”
A party that pursued too much taxation and redistribution would offend the middle, as would a party that resisted solidarity and showed an insufficient commitment to the welfare state.
In Italy, this two-party dispensation disintegrated in the 1990s, when corruption scandals wiped out the Christian Democrats, and when the country’s small socialist party also faded.
In France, the old arrangement stretched on until the 2017 presidential election, when neither of the mainstream parties’ candidates qualified for the run-off.
Now, Germany, too, appears to be headed for a multi-party system featuring endless negotiations and inevitably complicated coalition agreements.
The most obvious loser in this year’s election is outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU, which has held office longer than any other party in the Federal Republic’s history.
Up until the past decade, the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, could generally count on securing over 40% of the vote.
Even when it received only 33% in the 2017 election (compared to 20.5% for the SPD), it still emerged as the strongest party and de facto coalition leader.
But this time, the CDU/CSU has received only 24%, and the SPD has surpassed it with 25.7%.
The simplest explanation for this is that the Christian element of the Christian Democratic base has shrunk as Germany has become increasingly secular, and thus more disenchanted with both Protestant and Catholic organized religion.
The German electorate also exhibits a widespread sense of fatigue and a longing for something new.
Merkel’s departure represents the end of an era, and many Germans now feel that it is time for a change.
And yet, Germans are also gripped by nostalgia.
They miss the time when their security felt relatively assured, and they worry about whether their country can meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.
After Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s stodgy provincialism in the 1980s and 1990s, Merkel came to power in 2005 promising a fresh outlook.
But, in the end, she offered merely her own version of provincialism.
Notwithstanding the new fragmentation, the election’s outcome is still very German in the sense that a profound underlying consensus persists.
With the exception of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the far-left Die Linke, all of the parties were competing for the center, all take environmental issues seriously, and all have strived to offer voters feasible solutions to the country’s problems.
In the end, German voters were not faced with an extremely polarized choice – such as between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson in the United Kingdom in 2019, or between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen in France in 2017.
The AfD and Die Linke both performed worse than they did four years ago.
During the campaign, the Greens, the SPD, and the CDU/CSU all presented themselves as Merkel’s heirs.
The CDU candidate for the chancellorship, Armin Laschet, emphasized continuity and party affiliation.
The SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, was finance minister in the last government and has sought to associate himself with the brilliant legacy of former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who was also from Hamburg, and who struggled continually with the SPD’s left wing.
Finally, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens bears some resemblance to the young Merkel, who herself had been written off by rivals and the press as a lightweight.
The election was fought mainly on the grounds of character and personal appeal.
The question was not who had the better program but who was most trustworthy.
The only exception was the Free Democratic Party, which advocates slightly more fiscal conservatism.
With around 11% of the vote, a small gain on its 2017 result, the FDP could play a significant role in the coalition negotiations.
A key feature of Merkelism was her strategy of consensus-building, or what her critics would call demobilization.
She always sought to create the impression that there were no truly important issues at stake in elections, and that there were few realistic alternatives to the mainstream position she represented.
(Thus, she emphasized – correctly – that there was no alternative to the euro.)
But as we have seen in the UK and the United States in recent years, one of the most devastating consequences of the new populism is its subversion of trust in electoral outcomes.
Some Germans will now take a page from this playbook to claim malign interference in the election.
While the Greens looked to be significantly ahead in the polls at the start of the campaign, their support then slumped, perhaps owing to a wave of social-media campaigns designed to convince young people that the party supports absurd lifestyle prohibitions.
Green supporters are now wondering whether these campaigns were the result of their party’s hard line vis-à-vis Russia and China.
Germany wanted to give up provincialism, but what it got instead is complexity.
There still is no alternative, and now the political system seems less transparent and more manipulated than before.
The next government will be decided behind closed doors.
That is a worrying first chapter for the next era of politics in Europe’s most powerful country.

Emmanuel Macron’s Balkan Betrayal
DENVER – Since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago, Western leaders have consistently maintained that there are no problems on the European continent that cannot be addressed through engagement with the European Union or an expansion of the European project.
But that longstanding outlook seems to be changing, owing to a combination of internal EU woes and American indifference.
It may seem awkward that the United States would encourage membership in someone else’s club in the first place.
But from its leadership position within NATO – the premier European security organization – the US has always been supportive of European efforts to consolidate political and economic unity on the continent.
And the EU, for its part, has recognized that membership in the bloc is a logical aspiration for the post-Soviet countries on its periphery.
While deepening and enlarging the structures of the EU has proved to be more difficult than many US observers realized, European leaders have soldiered on, not least because that is what was expected of them in the context of post-Cold War history.
But the European Council’s recent meeting on October 17-18 provided confirmation that something has changed: French President Emmanuel Macron made the fateful decision to block EU accession talks with Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia.
With the United Kingdom leaving the EU and German Chancellor Angela Merkel retiring from politics, Macron is the heir apparent to European leadership.
But his reasoning on the question of EU expansion is opaque.
Many, even in the conspiracy-minded Balkans, assume that Macron simply has no appetite for the difficult process of taking on two more member states from a still-troublesome region, given the internal challenges already facing the EU.
Still, the disappointment – even anger – over Macron’s decision is palpable in Tirana and Skopje (the Albanian and North Macedonian capitals, respectively).
North Macedonia, after all, just finished changing its official name in order to placate Greece, which had been vetoing its membership on the grounds that its name was too similar to the Greek region of Macedonia.
Meanwhile, Bulgaria, another EU member, has also frustrated North Macedonia’s efforts, accusing the Macedonians of claiming Bulgarian national heroes as their own, and demanding that they amend their history books.
Faced with these demands and struggling with the legacy of corruption left by his predecessor (who has, oddly, now found “asylum” in Hungary), North Macedonia’s relatively new, inexperienced prime minister, Zoran Zaev, concluded that his country urgently needed to get into NATO and the EU.
He rammed through the long-sought name change, normalized relations with Greece, placated the Bulgarians, and applied for membership.
He knew that the name change did not poll well, that many Macedonians saw it as a humiliation that could be justified only by EU accession.
But, because both NATO and the EU had singled out the name dispute as the main hurdle to membership, he and the Macedonian public had high hopes for gaining admission to both organizations.
For its part, NATO has followed through.
Though some members still need to approve, the Republic of North Macedonia is expected to become a full NATO member at the alliance’s December summit.
But the EU accession process has been much slower.
Macron, who has said very little on the subject, seems to be worried that continuing enlargement of the bloc will make reforming its governance structures more difficult.
But by slamming on the brakes, he has put Zaev in a precarious position.
North Macedonian voters, their hopes dashed, will return to the polls for a general election in April.
In the past, one might have expected the US to step in.
But in the context of US President Donald Trump’s largely unformed foreign policy, the plight of small, distant countries like North Macedonia and Albania barely registers.
Of course, it is possible that Trump has tired of the French president’s star power and is welcoming the recent criticism of him with a sense of schadenfreude.
It is also possible that Trump doesn’t want Albania and North Macedonia to join the EU.
But, most likely, he simply has no idea what is happening in the Western Balkans.
Just a few years ago, the US doubtless would have been working with the EU to facilitate the accession process for both countries.
While EU membership would not solve their problems, it would help to address institutional weaknesses, and it would signal to an increasingly revanchist Russia that the geopolitical game in the Balkans is coming to an end.
Given the trauma the region has suffered over the past 25 years, America and Europe have a duty to fulfill the promise of the post-Cold War era.

Less Bang for America’s Stimulus Buck
MILAN – The run-up to the economic crisis in the United States was characterized by excessive leverage in financial institutions and the household sector, inflating an asset bubble that eventually collapsed and left balance sheets damaged to varying degrees.
The aftermath involves resetting asset values, deleveraging, and rehabilitating balance sheets – resulting in today’s higher saving rate, significant shortfall in domestic demand, and sharp uptick in unemployment.
So the most important question the US now faces is whether continued fiscal and monetary stimulus can, as some believe, help to right the economy.
To be sure, at the height of the crisis, the combined effect of fiscal stimulus and massive monetary easing had a big impact in preventing a credit freeze and limiting the downward spiral in asset prices and real economic activity.
But that period is over.
The reason is simple: the pre-crisis period of consuming capital gains that turned out to be at least partly ephemeral inevitably led to a post-crisis period of inhibited spending, diminished demand, and higher unemployment.
Counter-cyclical policy can moderate these negative effects, but it cannot undo the damage or accelerate the recovery beyond fairly strict limits.
As a result, the benefits associated with deficit-financed boosts to household income are now being diminished by the propensity to save and rebuild net worth.
On the business side, investment and employment follows demand once the inventory cycle has run its course.
Until demand returns, business will remain in a cost-cutting mode.
The bottom line is that deficit spending is now fighting a losing battle with an economy that is deleveraging and restructuring its balance sheets, its exports, and its microeconomic composition – in short, its future growth potential.
That restructuring will occur, deficit spending or no deficit spending.
So policy needs to acknowledge the fact that there are limits to how fast this restructuring can be accomplished.
Attempting to exceed these speed limits not only risks damaging the fiscal balance and the dollar’s stability and resilience, but also may leave the economy and government finances highly vulnerable to future shocks that outweigh the quite modest short-term benefits of accelerated investment and employment.
Demand will revive, but only slowly.
True, asset prices have recovered enough to help balance sheets, but probably not enough to help consumption.
The impact on consumption will largely have to wait until balance sheets, for both households and businesses, are more fully repaired.
Higher foreign demand from today’s trade-surplus countries (China, Germany, and Japan, among others) could help restore some of the missing demand.
But that involves structural change in those economies as well, and thus will take time.
Moreover, responding to expanded foreign demand will require structural changes in the US economy, which will also take time.
This is not to say that rebalancing global demand is unimportant.
Quite the contrary.
But achieving that goal has more to do with restoring the underpinnings of global growth over three to five years than it does with a short-term restoration of balance and employment in the advanced economies, especially the US.
Today, the best way to use deficits and government debt is to focus on distributional issues, particularly the unemployed, both actual and potential.
In an extended balance-sheet recession of this type, unemployment benefits need to be substantial and prolonged.
The argument that this would discourage the unemployed from seeking work has merit in normal times, but not now.
Today’s unemployment, after all, is structural, rather than the result of perverse incentives.
Benefits should be expanded and extended for a limited, discretionary period.
When structural barriers to employment have diminished, unemployment benefits should revert to their old norms.
Doing this would not only reduce the unequal burden now being carried by the unemployed; it would also help to sustain consumption, and perhaps reduce some precautionary savings among those who fear losing their jobs in the future.
Monetary policy is a more complex and difficult balancing act.
A more aggressive interest-rate policy would likely reduce asset prices (or at least slow the rate of appreciation), increase adjustable-rate debt-service burdens, and trigger additional balance-sheet distress and disorderly deleveraging, such as foreclosures.
All of this would slow the recovery, perhaps even causing it to stall.
But there are consequences to abjuring this approach as well.
Low-cost credit is unlikely to have a significant impact on consumption in the short run, but it can produce asset inflation and misallocations.
Much of the rest of the world would prefer a stronger dollar, fewer capital inflows with a carry-trade flavor, and less need to manage their own currencies’ appreciation to avoid adverse consequences for their economies’ competitiveness.
In short, the sort of monetary policy now being practiced for a fragile economy like the US will cause distortions in the global economy that require policy responses in many other countries.
From a political point of view, the crisis has been portrayed as a failure of financial regulation, with irresponsible lending fueling a rapid rise in systemic risk.
That leaves the rest of the real economy populated with people who feel like victims – albeit victims who, prior to the crisis, bought a lot of houses, vacations, TVs, and cars.
Unfortunately, that perception pushes the policy response in the direction of too much remedial action, even when the marginal returns are low.
What we most need now is support for the unemployed, stable government finances with a clearly communicated deficit-reduction plan, some truth-telling about medium-term growth prospects, and an orderly healing process in which balance sheets are restored mostly without government intervention.

Climate Safety Nets for All
LONDON – As preparations for this year’s COP26 climate summit in Glasgow intensify, attention is focused on efforts to prevent a future catastrophe.
But real-time climate catastrophes already are playing out in the lives of millions of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people.
What will COP26 offer them?
Stick a pin in a map of global humanitarian emergencies, and you will most likely land on a crisis that has been caused or aggravated by droughts, floods, and storms.
In 2019, extreme weather events pushed more than 34 million people into hunger and food insecurity.
In the 55 countries with food-insecurity crises, 75 million children under the age of five are chronically undernourished and face higher risks of diarrhea, pneumonia, and other killer diseases that accompany droughts and floods.
Save the Children is responding to these emergencies.
In the Horn of Africa, our nutrition programs are treating the children of farming families devastated by successive droughts, floods, and the worst desert locust infestation in a generation.
In the Sahel region, we are working with communities hit by drought and displaced by increasingly deadly conflicts over water.
But humanitarian efforts are being overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis – and worse is to come.
COP26 is one of our last opportunities to lock in the measures needed to keep temperatures within the 1.5º-2º Celsius ceiling set in 2015 by the Paris climate agreement.
But even 1.5ºC of warming would have disastrous implications for poverty and malnutrition in the poorest countries.
The evidence from climate science points overwhelmingly toward less predictable rainfall, more extreme, frequent, and protracted droughts, and more destructive storms.
Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Association anticipates a long-term decline in food productivity in Africa, the world’s most food-insecure region.
Rich countries are already investing heavily in adapting to climate-change threats.
When disasters strike, their citizens can fall back on elaborate safety nets, well-financed health systems, and insurance policies covering loss and damage to assets.
Flood defenses are being strengthened across Europe, and America’s current Farm Bill includes a $39 billion federal insurance program to protect heavily subsidized producers against crop losses.
Contrast that with the situation facing Africa’s farmers.
When extreme weather events destroy crops, kill livestock, and drive up food prices, families cope by cutting meals and reducing spending on health and education.
Lacking insurance and savings, the poorest households are forced to sell off productive assets, including livestock, effectively closing their route to recovery.
Livestock losses during Somalia’s 2016 drought cost the country’s farmers an estimated $2 billion – an extraordinary loss for some of the world’s poorest people.
The international community’s preferred first-line response to climate disaster is to provide humanitarian aid.
That aid saves lives, but the current system invariably delivers too little, too late.
Last year, donors provided only half of the funding requested by the UN – a record gap.
And much of the aid arrived long after the most vulnerable families had already been forced to cut food consumption, withdraw children from school, and sell assets.
There is a better way to support the world’s most vulnerable populations.
Three years ago, I met women pastoral farmers in Wajir, an arid area in northern Kenya, in the aftermath of a devastating drought. They had managed to avoid cutting meals for children or selling off their livestock because they were receiving cash through Kenya’s Hunger Safety Net Programme.
As soon as the drought struck, early payments were automatically triggered (based on rainfall data).
Well-designed safety nets succeed where humanitarian aid often fails, because they catch vulnerable people as soon as they start to fall, instead of waiting until they hit the ground; thus, they provide a springboard for recovery.
There is abundant evidence from the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and other regions that small cash transfers improve nutrition, increase investment, and boost crop production, especially when targeted to women.
And these programs can respond rapidly to a crisis.
During the 2017 drought, Ethiopia’s safety net was extended to reach an additional three million people.
Early action is the key to rapid recovery.
Every dollar invested in recovery during the first few weeks of a drought in the Horn of Africa can save poor farmers $50 in lost income and assets four months later.
When linked to early-warning systems, safety nets can also provide a platform for crisis prevention.
In Bangladesh, vulnerable households were provided grants ahead of anticipated flooding, enabling them to relocate.
Beyond saving lives and protecting assets, the program reached twice as many people as a previous humanitarian response had, and at half the cost.
Targeted safety-net programs could offer an efficient and equitable way to build resilience against climate change.
Unfortunately, they are currently weakest where they are most urgently needed.
Fewer than one in five people in low-income countries are currently covered; and in Africa, safety nets are chronically under-financed, fragmented, and poorly equipped to address the critical challenge of responding to child poverty and malnutrition.
At COP26, world leaders should task the World Bank and the United Nations with developing a strategy to reach the 155 million people facing food-insecurity crises, and to prioritize children in safety-net design.
Increased finance will be crucial, especially given the post-pandemic fiscal constraints that many developing countries now face.
The G7 has already agreed in principle to authorize a new allocation of the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset, special drawing rights (SDRs).
Reallocating these funds to the poorest countries would go a long way toward creating the fiscal space to invest in safety nets.
So, too, would additional debt relief and the $25 billion in new funding proposed by the World Bank’s International Development Association.
As the host of COP26, the United Kingdom’s government should focus its climate-adaptation efforts on galvanizing support for safety nets.
Reversing its recent decision to cut the UK’s foreign-aid budget by one-third would be a good starting point.
Slashing support for nutrition programs and climate-related humanitarian responses in regions like the Sahel and the Horn of Africa is a short-sighted dereliction of leadership, and an embarrassing retreat from multilateralism.
Safety nets are not an antidote for climate injustice.
But, linked to decisive action to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century, they could limit the harm suffered by those who bear the least responsibility for the climate crisis.
We must seize that opportunity at COP26.

Xi of Arabia
BEIJING – Those who have criticized China’s cautious foreign policy need to reconsider their position, following President Xi Jinping’s just-completed visit to Saudi Arabia and Iran – two major Middle Eastern powers that are currently at each other’s throats.
The visits reflect the more active foreign-policy approach that Xi has spearheaded, particularly in the Middle East.
This new approach raises an important question: Can China’s impact on the region be more constructive than that of the United States?
Now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the Middle East, a region where, as Richard N. Haass argues, a New Thirty Years’ War, in which “civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish,” is unfolding.
A key factor in unleashing the current chaos – which represents the convergence of numerous deep-rooted challenges and conflicts – was America’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.
By eliminating Saddam Hussein’s Sunni regime, the US paved the way for a Shia-led government, a development that tilted the regional balance of power toward Iran and left Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia feeling encircled by a Shia coalition.
That is why Iran and Saudi Arabia are so deeply involved in Syria’s civil war.
They know that the fate of President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime will have significant implications for the regional order.
For Saudi Arabia, reining in Iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country’s nuclear program, which has resulted in the lifting of international economic sanctions that have long constrained Iran’s regional leadership ambitions.
Of course, neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran – or Turkey, which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation.
These countries would rather empower other actors, even if it means fueling dangerous religious radicalization and the privatization of violence.
The terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach – namely, the Islamic State – cannot be defeated using traditional counter-terrorism operations.
To be sure, these Middle East rivals are not the only ones involved in the region’s current quagmire.
External powers like France, Russia, and, of course, the US are also deeply involved, each with its own geopolitical objectives.
Now China is entering the fray, bringing a uniquely constructive vision with it.
The two characters that comprise the Chinese word for crisis (危机) mean, individually, “danger” (危) and “opportunity” (机).
That is precisely what China sees in today’s Middle East.
For most of the relevant actors, highly perilous geopolitical competition is overshadowing vast economic opportunities.
Not for China.
As Xi put it on his recent visit to Cairo: “Instead of looking for a proxy in the Middle East, we promote peace talks; instead of seeking any sphere of influence, we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road initiative.”
This reflects the broader foreign-policy rebalancing that Xi has been pursuing since taking office in 2013.
Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.”
The Middle East is crucial to this connectivity-oriented grand strategy, not least because of its key role in the “One Belt, One Road” project that Xi promoted in Cairo.
China’s determination to reestablish the ancient Silk Roads – including the overland route that runs through the Middle East – has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight Arab countries in recent years, and to sign agreements with six Arab countries to pursue the initiative jointly.
Iran, Turkey, and seven Arab countries are among the founding members of the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a key institution for financing related infrastructure projects.
But China is not waiting for the One Belt, One Road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with Middle Eastern countries.
During his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, he claimed that free-trade negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council and China should be concluded this year.
Moreover, Xi announced that China will issue $55 billion in loans to the Middle East, including a $15 billion special loan for industrialization, $10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity, and $10 billion in concessional loans.
The remaining $20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to invest in traditional energy, infrastructure development, and high-end manufacturing industries in the region.
All of this aligns with the “1+2+3” cooperation pattern that Xi proposed at the June 2014 Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.
According to this approach, energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration, while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings.
Nuclear power, satellites, and new energy sources are three high-tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs.
Here, the goal is to take advantage of the region’s energy resources, while helping it to industrialize and diversify its economy.
Of course, China’s success in the Middle East requires progress on mitigating the region’s tensions, cooling its hotspots, and stabilizing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors.
But peace and development are inextricably linked.
To turn the tide against extremism, Middle Eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people, and these can only be secured through trade, investment, and jobs.
In this fundamental respect, China has a lot to offer the Middle East – and President Xi has once again shown his determination to offer it.

America's Crisis Election
CAMBRIDGE – On November 4, Americans will elect their 44th president amidst the worst financial turmoil the country has known since the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. Both candidates are United States senators with little experience as executives, so their ability to manage the crisis has become a central issue in the election.
At the beginning of the campaign, many observers predicted that Iraq would be the major issue in 2008.
Instead, it is the financial crisis.
In principle, this should help Barack Obama and the Democrats, because polls show them stronger on economic issues, whereas Republicans and John McCain do better on security issues.
After the Republican convention, polls showed McCain ahead in early September, but after the financial meltdown, Obama took the lead.
Although both men have warily embraced the $700 billion bailout of the financial sector, the contrasts between the two men are sharp.
Obama is not only the first African-American nominee of a major party, but also one of the youngest candidates ever.
McCain has experience as a naval aviator and more than two decades in the Senate.
If elected, he would be the oldest incoming president.
The two men differ in temperament as well as experience.
McCain is a man of strong traditional values who prides himself on his willingness to act quickly and decisively, which he sought to do during the negotiations on the bailout by suspending his campaign to return to Washington.
That effort appears to have backfired, because the Republicans that he leads initially balked at passing the legislation.
But McCain has shown himself to be resilient.
In 2007, many people wrote off his campaign, but he had the skills to resurrect it and capture the Republican nomination.
His choice of Alaska’s Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate shook up the presidential campaign.
Obama, while an inspirational orator, has shown a cool and calm demeanor in responding to both the financial crisis and the turbulence of political campaigning. When embarrassed by comments made by the pastor of his church, he delivered an exceptional speech about race in America.
If anything, some of Obama’s Democratic supporters wish he would show more emotion in responding to criticism.
One should be careful, however, about reading too much into national opinion polls measuring the candidates’ popular support.
American presidents are elected by an Electoral College in which each state votes in proportion to the number of members it has in Congress.
Since even the smallest states have two senators, this leads to overrepresentation of lightly populated Western states that tend to vote Republican.
In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but George W. Bush prevailed in the electoral college.
Thus, the two candidates’ campaigns are focusing heavily on a dozen or so states in which voters are closely divided and could sway the electoral college outcome.
Each campaign is now desperately trying to gauge the impact of the financial crisis on these battleground states.
Not only does the Electoral College confuse predictions based on national opinion polls, but there is also the possibility of surprises which can lead to last-minute reversals.
A mistake in a presidential debate can turn the tide of public opinion overnight, as happened to President Gerald Ford in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976.
Conversely, Ronald Reagan’s performance in his debate with Carter in 1980 is often credited with his victory.
Another event that could turn the tables would be an “October surprise” associated with terrorism, which could switch the agenda from the financial crisis back to security, the Republicans’ stronger suit.
In 2004, shortly before the election, Osama bin Laden released a video tape that may have helped President Bush defeat Senator John Kerry.
From bin Laden’s point of view, Bush’s policies were more useful for his efforts to recruit supporters than Kerry’s might have been.
One would assume that Obama would prove even more unsettling to bin Laden.
A recent BBC poll of 22 countries found that if the world could vote, Obama would win in a landslide.
The pro-Obama margin varied from 82% in Kenya (where Obama’s father was born) to 9% in India.
But Americans do not like outside interference in their elections.
When Obama attracted a crowd of 200,000 to a speech in Berlin last summer, Republicans criticized him as an elitist who appeals to crowds overseas but not to blue-collar workers at home.
On the other hand, in a September poll that asked Americans to rate a series of foreign-policy goals for the next president, 83% ranked “improving America’s standing in the world” as most important.
And certainly the election of the first African-American as president would do wonders to restore the soft power that the Bush administration squandered over the past eight years.
Some people worry that Obama might be good for American soft power, but not for its hard power.
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved.
Machiavelli may be correct, but we sometimes forget that the opposite of love is not fear, but hatred.
And Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid.
When the exercise of hard power undercuts soft power, it makes leadership more difficult – as Bush found out after the invasion of Iraq.
Both McCain and Obama possess impressive hard-power political and organizational skills; otherwise, they would not be where they are today.
But when it comes to the soft power skills of emotional intelligence, vision, and communication, Obama outranks McCain.
Whether that will sway American voters wary of financial turmoil on November 4 remains to be seen.

Erdoğan’s Second Chance
ISTANBUL – The outcome of Turkey’s latest general election – voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months – reveals important insights into the nature of the country’s democracy and the preferences of its citizens.
The first of Turkey’s two parliamentary elections this year, in June, was widely viewed as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s efforts to strengthen the powers of his office.
The result was clear.
Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) received just 41% of the vote, costing it the majority it had enjoyed since coming to power in 2002.
On November 1, however, after negotiations following the June elections resulted in a hung parliament, Turks voted again, and the outcome could not have been more different.
This time, the election was predominantly perceived as a referendum on the continuation of single-party rule, and the AKP won 49% of the vote, providing it with a comfortable majority.
In the run-up to the latest election, Erdoğan and the AKP emphasized the importance of the party’s parliamentary majority for Turkey’s political stability.
The opposition countered with the argument that a coalition government would counter the country’s deep political polarization, while helping to establish stronger checks and balances.
The promise of stability proved to be the more resonant message.
The political instability following June’s inconclusive election had been compounded by a sharp decline in domestic and regional security.
A renewed campaign of violence by the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and attacks by the Islamic State, including suicide bombings in Ankara that killed more than 100 people, created a backdrop that reinforced the AKP’s message.
The outcome of the vote attests to the ineffectiveness of Turkey’s parliamentary opposition, which once again failed to make a dent in the AKP’s popularity, almost as if they had set out to disprove the theory that electorates simply tire of long-serving governments.
Instead the AKP obtained its landslide victory – a major achievement after 13 years of uninterrupted rule – by siphoning voters from its competitors.
The party received nearly five million more votes than it did in June, corresponding to a 20% increase in its popularity.
Two opposition parties, the conservative Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the predominantly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), together lost three million votes, while the center-left Republican People’s Party (CHP) held its ground, finishing second with 25% of the vote.
Voters punished the nationalist MHP severely for its obstructionism following the June election, when it refused all offers to join a coalition government.
With 12% of the popular vote, compared to 16% in June, the MHP lost almost half of its parliamentary seats.
The HDP was handicapped by its inability to distance itself from the PKK, which a large section of the electorate regards as being responsible for the upsurge in domestic violence.
Indeed, the HDP seemed at risk of failing to obtain the 10% of the vote it would need to enter parliament, an outcome that would have provided the AKP with a majority large enough to amend the constitution on its own.
In the end, HDP ended with 10.75% of the vote, down from 13% in the June elections, preventing Erdoğan from securing the compliant parliament he would need to establish an executive presidency.
Nonetheless, Turkey’s new government has been provided with a broad enough mandate to address some of the country’s most difficult and imminent policy challenges – most notably the peace process with the Kurds.
A previous effort had been suspended ahead of the election, as the PKK returned to violence and the AKP’s leadership adopted increasingly nationalist and hawkish rhetoric.
With the election over, however, there is hope that the new government will restart the negotiations.
If successful, the talks would have a major impact not only domestically, but also on the ongoing fight against the Islamic State.
The AKP’s majority will also enable it to continue to recalibrate the country’s foreign policy.
Turkey’s policies following the Arab Spring had led to a loss of influence and friends in the region; but recently the country has begun to adapt its approach to the realities on the ground.
For example, Turkey has lifted its objections to a role for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in negotiations to end the civil war in Syria.
Similarly, a new commitment to the struggle against the Islamic State has eliminated a core point of friction with Turkey’s Western partners.
The main trap the new government must avoid is a return to a heavily paternalistic style of governance.
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent more benignly, in a way that befits a country negotiating accession to the European Union.
The lesson of the two elections is clear: Turkey’s voters want a strong, stable government, but not one that runs roughshod over its opponents.

Nigeria’s Road to Ruin
With so much political friction in Iran and Iraq, it is easy to overlook the growing unrest in Nigeria, the world’s eighth-largest oil exporter.
But Nigeria’s mounting social and political problems reveal how violence and uncertainty in yet another major energy producer is driving foreign investors out and global oil prices up.
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo appears poised to try to amend the country’s constitution to allow himself a chance at a third term.
To that end, he has marginalized many of his political rivals.
Vice President Atiku Abubakar – a likely presidential aspirant in 2007 – has been harassed and isolated.
Ministers suspected of less than full loyalty have been sidelined.
But Obasanjo’s adversaries have joined the battle, and the president lacks the two-thirds majority needed in both the federal and state legislatures to remain in power after next year.
Two former Nigerian presidents, Generals Muhammadu Buhari and Ibrahim Babangida, publicly oppose Obasanjo’s constitutional meddling, and several governors of Nigeria’s Muslim-dominated northern states have made clear that they are determined to see Obasanjo off when his term expires in 2007.
As a result, the uncertainty surrounding Obasanjo’s plans is increasing sectional tensions.
At stake is the cohesion of a state that many argue is yet another example of an artificial nation cobbled together by Europeans who did not understand their creation’s social, tribal, and religious forces.
Northern governors oppose a third term for Obasanjo because they believe it is now their turn to choose Nigeria’s president under a deal, struck with their southern counterparts when democracy was introduced in 1999, for regional rotation of the presidency.
Southern governors argue that control of the presidency should remain with the south for years to come, because the north controlled the country during more than three decades of dictatorship.
Indeed, even southern governors who are not reliable Obasanjo allies appear determined to maintain their influence within the central government by ensuring that the country’s next president is a southerner.
For the moment, Obasanjo offers them their best opportunity to realize that goal.
Last December, 16 of Nigeria’s 17 southern governors signed the “Enugu Declaration” in support of the constitutional amendment that would permit him a third term.
This is a bad time for Nigeria’s federal government to face these distractions.
The Niger Delta region, home to most of Nigeria’s oil and many of its poor people, is in turmoil.
In October 2004, violence in the region forced Obasanjo’s government to negotiate with militia leader Asari Dokubu, after his men attacked a series of Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities and threatened to “burn down the area.”
In December 2004, Dokubu’s militias took 75 oil workers hostage and forced Shell to shut down about 10% of the country’s oil supply.
Dokubu then forced Obasanjo into a peace deal.
The deal did not last long.
After Dokubu renewed threats to oil infrastructure last September, he was arrested on sedition charges and now faces the possibility of execution or life in prison.
Dokubu’s allies have responded with new attacks.
A splinter group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, has claimed credit for several recent attacks and kidnappings of foreign workers, and says it will not retreat until Delta states gain control of the revenue produced by locally extracted oil.
There are also fears that the splintering of Dokubu’s militias has created fertile ground in the Delta for Islamist groups.
A few weeks ago, a previously unknown organization called “The Martyr’s Brigade” claimed credit for attacks on Delta pipelines, raising concerns among multinationals that mercenary resistance in the region is becoming ideological.
Whatever the motivations of the various groups, a surge of militia attacks and kidnappings over the past several weeks has now shut down roughly 20% of Nigeria’s oil exports and killed dozens of people.
Shell has closed key facilities in the Delta after the abduction of several workers.
Once a verdict is reached in Dokubu’s trial, probably this summer, violence is expected to intensify.
In addition, religious violence sparked by the Danish cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad ripped through Nigeria in February.
Angry Muslim and Christian mobs burned churches and mosques, killing dozens of people in a series of attacks and reprisals that have deepened the sectional divide between the Muslim north and the Christian south.
If all this turmoil weren’t enough, the discovery of avian flu in the northern provinces further undermines political stability.
Obasanjo has called on Muslim farmers in the area to cull their birds, a key source of protein in a region where malnutrition is a constant threat.
In some ways, Nigeria is plagued with the same problems facing Iraq.
Various ethnic and religious groups, based in different regions, are battling for oil revenue and political clout.
As in Iraq, the conflict could provoke large-scale bloodletting.
Yet, unlike Iraq, Nigeria has a recent history of relatively stable democratic governance.
The country’s factions each have good reason to compromise before the conflict comes to a head.
Northern governors could, for example, offer the southern states a larger share of Nigeria's oil revenue in exchange for their support for a northern president.
But achieving such a compromise won’t be a smooth or predictable process.
On the contrary, the risks of extended political instability and further large-scale disruptions to Nigeria’s oil output will remain high, at a time when the world can least afford it.

China's Post-Olympic Challenge
NEW YORK – Almost everyone in the world who watched the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was impressed by China’s preparations, the acumen of the Chinese in running such a complex and challenging event, and the rich harvest of medals – especially gold medal – that Chinese athletes won.
It was abundantly evident in the run-up to the Games how important it was to Chinese everywhere to show themselves to advantage.
One got a sense of this when China’s reputation and the Games’ status came under attack during the Tibetan demonstrations and protests against the Olympic torch as it made its tortured progress around the world.
But, when all was said and done, through what turned out to be often Draconian controls, China pulled off quite a feat!
Indeed, it is hard to imagine that the British will care as much, or go to such extremes, for the London Olympics in 2012.
For many years, especially since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, China has felt a deficit of global respect.
This feeling has deeply troubled its leaders and filled its people with a sense that, despite all their economic progress, their proper place in the world was not only eluding them, but being denied to them by the endless criticism of the so-called “developed world.”
For the last two decades, Chinese leaders have been diligently trying to build a new edifice in order to gain some of that missing respect.
This made a successful Olympic Games, when all the world would be watching, an urgent matter.
But, now that the Games have ended, Chinese leaders cannot quite say, “Mission accomplished.”
While China’s achievement is worthy of genuine esteem, its efforts to gain a full measure of international respect and real “great power” status will not succeed until it matches its new economic and military power with a certain essential moral force.
That, in turn, requires a society and a leadership that seeks to be exemplary in all ways that make human beings more human, including respect for truthfulness, openness, tolerance, and people’s right to disagree with their government.
I fear that China’s leaders and people will continue to feel a certain gnawing, inchoate sense of deficiency and incompleteness in their quest for global respect until they find the strength to begin addressing the crucial, but elusive, issue of making China an ethical, as well as an economic and military, power.
For a country steeped in millennia of Confucianism, the need for ethical leadership should be clear.
To fully address the question of the moral and ethical base of a new form of Chinese governance, China’s government and its people must be able to look back freely and come to terms with their recent history: the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the events of 1989, Tibet, and other sensitive issues.
They must also freely be able to discuss the future and what kind of society they wish to see rise from the ashes of Mao’s revolution.
I make these somewhat critical observations about China not with any sense of moral superiority or a wish to relieve myself of the responsibility to level the same critique at my own country’s recent failures.
As most of the world knows, America’s quest to maintain its claim to the title of “greatness,” has, of late, also been elusive.
Arriving from different staring points, both the United States and China now find themselves confronting a similar challenge: restoring global trust and respect.
Their success inevitably requires directly confronting their evident moral failures.
If many of those same viewers who have been impressed by China’s successes in Beijing now also find themselves recoiling at the idea of a stronger and more prideful China, that is understandable.
For strength unalloyed by checks and balances – and by a capacity for self-critical reflection about the rightness and wrongness of state action – can be unnerving.
Many Americans, too, have recently had to learn this.
One hopes that China will derive a new measure of respect and self-confidence from these astounding Games. But one also hopes that China’s successes will enable its leaders to feel strong enough to begin looking honestly at China’s recent past in a more critical way.
Such forthrightness is not easy for any country.
But, having completed such an important step forward, China must now find new, more humanistic ways to continue to re-invent itself.

The Deflation Bogeyman
BRUSSELS – Central banks throughout the developed world have been overwhelmed by the fear of deflation.
They shouldn’t be: The fear is unfounded, and the obsession with it is damaging.
Japan is a poster child for the fear.
In 2013, decades of (gently) falling prices prompted the Bank of Japan to embark on an unprecedented monetary offensive.
But while headline inflation increased for a while, the factors driving that increase – a competitive depreciation of the yen and a tax increase – did not last long.
Now, the country is slipping back into near-deflation – a point that panicked headlines underscore.
But, contrary to the impression created by media reports, the Japanese economy is far from moribund.
Unemployment has virtually disappeared; the employment rate continues to reach new highs; and disposable income per capita is rising steadily.
In fact, even during Japan’s so-called “lost decades,” per capita income grew by as much as it did in the United States and Europe, and the employment rate rose, suggesting that deflation may not be quite as nefarious as central bankers seem to believe.
In the US and Europe, there is also little sign of an economic calamity resulting from central banks’ failure to reach their inflation targets.
Growth remains solid, if not spectacular, and employment is rising.
There are two key problems with central banks’ current approach. First, they are focused on consumer prices, which is the wrong target.
Consumer prices are falling for a simple reason: energy and other raw material prices have declined by more than half in the last two years.
The decline is therefore temporary, and central banks should look past it, much as they looked past the increase in consumer prices when oil prices were surging.
Instead, central banks should focus on the rate of revenue increase, measured in nominal GDP growth; that is, after all, what matters for highly indebted governments and enterprises.
By this measure, there is no deflation: The GDP price index (called GDP deflator) in developed countries is increasing by 1-1.5%, on average. In the eurozone, it is rising at 1.2%.
This may fall short of the European Central Bank’s target of “below but close to 2%,” but not by a margin substantial enough to justify the ECB’s increasingly aggressive use of monetary instruments to stimulate the economy.
Moreover, nominal GDP growth exceeds the long-term interest rate.
When, as is usually the case, the long-term interest rate is higher than the GDP growth rate, the wealthy may accumulate wealth faster than the rest of the economy – a point made by the economist Thomas Piketty.
But today, nominal GDP growth far exceeds average long-term interest rates (which, in some countries, include risk premia of up to 100 basis points) – even in the eurozone, where nominal GDP growth is expected to reach about 3% this year.
This means that financing conditions are as favorable as they were at the peak of the credit boom in 2007, and much better than they have been at any other point in the last 20 years.
One might expect this evidence to compel central bankers to rethink their current concerns about deflation.
But they remain committed to pursuing their inflation targets, convinced that even a slight bout of deflation could initiate a downward spiral, with falling demand causing prices to decline further.
This is their second mistake.
Of course, a deflationary spiral is possible, and its consequences could be serious.
If real interest rates were significantly positive, demand could plummet, pushing down prices to the point that it becomes impossible for borrowers to service their debts.
Such a spiral contributed to the Great Depression in the US in the 1930s, with prices falling, in some years, by some 20-30%.
But we are nowhere near such conditions today.
In fact, nominal interest rates are at zero, while the broadest price indices are increasing, albeit gently.
Given that financing conditions are so favorable, it is not surprising that domestic demand has remained robust, allowing unemployment to return to pre-crisis lows almost everywhere.
The eurozone is the only large developed economy where unemployment remains substantial, and thus the only economy where the case could be made for a downside risk of deflation.
But even in the eurozone, GDP growth is slightly above its (admittedly very meager) potential, so that the remaining output gap is being closed gradually.
Furthermore, the only reason why unemployment remains high in the eurozone is that the labor-force participation rate has continued to increase throughout the recession; and, indeed, employment is returning to pre-crisis levels.
This is the exact opposite of what the deflation hawks warn about.
The popular “discouraged worker” hypothesis holds that a slide into deflation is costly, because a long recession induces workers to leave the labor force altogether.
That is simply not the case in Europe today.
The evidence is clear.
Developed-economy central banks should overcome their irrational fear of a deflationary spiral, and stop trying desperately to stimulate demand.
Otherwise, they will find themselves with massively expanded balance sheets, and very little to show for it.

Smart Taxes
ATHENS/BERLIN – Governments throughout the European Union and around the world confront a seeming Catch-22: the millstone of national debt around their necks has required them to reduce deficits through spending cuts and tax increases.
But these are impeding the consumer spending needed to boost economic activity and kick-start growth.
As the debate shifts from austerity towards measures aimed at stimulating growth, smarter taxation will be essential to getting the balance right.
When governments think about the difficult task of raising taxes, they usually think about income tax, business taxes, and value-added tax (VAT).
But there are other taxes that can raise significant amounts of revenue with a much less negative impact on the economy.
These are the taxes that governments already levy on electricity and fossil fuels.
Such taxes play a crucial role in cutting the carbon emissions that cause climate change.
But recent research shows that they can also play a useful role in raising government revenue at little cost in terms of economic growth.
Euro for euro, dollar for dollar, yen for yen: energy and carbon taxes have a lower negative impact on a nation’s economy, consumption, and jobs than income tax and VAT.
For example, an increase in direct taxes, such as income tax, can reduce consumption by twice as much as energy and carbon taxes that raise the same amount of revenue.
Maintaining consumption at as high a level as possible is vital to reviving economic activity, which means that freeing money for consumers to spend is just as important.
Energy and carbon taxes can raise revenue while leaving the economy in a stronger state to sustain a recovery.
Conventional taxes raise revenue, but pose a much greater risk of depressing growth in the process.
This is not the only reason why looking more closely at energy and carbon taxes makes sense.
The current framework for energy taxation, particularly in Europe, is not sustainable.
Tax rates on different fuels vary by more than 50% across the EU, causing major distortions in the single market.
Creating a level playing field on energy taxation in the EU would harmonize economic incentives, eliminate gas-tank tourism by drivers crossing borders for lower prices, and improve the business climate in all of Europe’s economies.
Rising energy bills, driven by the cost of fossil fuels, are a massive political issue in many countries in Europe and elsewhere, including the United States, where consumer energy prices have become a major issue in the run-up to this year’s presidential election.
But, relative to other forms of taxation, energy taxation tends to benefit consumers overall.
The gains from avoiding the negative impact of conventional taxes work across the economy, particularly as the least well-off maintain a higher level of disposable household income.
Most energy and carbon taxes are levied by national governments.
But in Europe there is another option for raising revenues: the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (ETS).
In terms of the effect on GDP and jobs, the cost of increasing revenue from this source would be as much as one-third less than that of raising the same amount via income taxes or VAT.
Given Europe’s fiscal deficits and the economic impact of reducing them, that is a huge potential prize.
But, first, the issues depressing the carbon price must be addressed.
Taking the massive over-allocation of carbon-emission permits out of the ETS will be vital.
Finance ministers everywhere need to think more imaginatively about their fiscal options.
Energy and carbon taxes can produce less economic pain and more gain than conventional taxes can.
Europe needs fiscal consolidation, reductions in carbon emissions, and a strategy for economic growth.
Greater reliance should be placed on energy taxes and an effective ETS to deliver all three.

Education is a Security Issue
LONDON – In November, I spoke at the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 13 years. It struck me how different the mood is now.
In September 2000, the world seemed very different.
We were trying to articulate the new security order in the decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Of course there were challenges.
But the atmosphere was light, positive even, as we discussed eradicating poverty in the developing world.
This time, the mood was dark.
And the first days of 2014 have made it darker still. Scroll down any day’s news summary and you find stories of terrorism and violence perpetrated in the cause of a false view of religion.
Some of it is committed by non-state actors, and some of it by state actors; but all of it is committed in the context of division and conflict defined by differences of religious faith.
This is the new struggle of the twenty-first century. We will not win it unless we fight its root causes as well as its ghastly consequences.
Today, in an arc that stretches from the Far East through the Middle East to the streets of cities in Europe and the United States, we face a scourge that has taken innocent lives, scarred communities, and destabilized countries.
It is a threat that is constantly evolving, growing, and mutating to counter our fight against it.
The extremists propagating this violence have networks of outreach to young people and know the power of education, whether formal or informal.
Extremists are filling young minds with the belief that anyone who disagrees is an enemy – and not just their enemy, but God’s enemy.
The security debate has understandably often focused on the consequences.
After an attack, states consider immediate security measures.
Terrorists are hunted down.
Then we get back to our daily lives, until the next time it happens.
But lasting change depends on dealing with the root causes of extremism.
Of course politics plays its part.
And the extremists are good at jumping on the back of political grievances.
But the soil in which they plant the seeds of hate is fertilized with ignorance.
That is why we need to start thinking of education as a security issue.
The extremists justify killing in the name of God.
This is an obscene perversion of proper religious faith.
And it is a menace, both for the harm that it does directly and for the damaging division and sectarianism that it nurtures indirectly. Every killing is a human tragedy.
But it also causes a chain reaction of bitterness and hatred.
There is real fear in the communities plagued by such extremism, fear that paralyzes normal life and pushes people away from each other.
Globalization is intensifying and multiplying this extremism.
Not limited by borders, it can spring up anywhere. We are more connected than at any point in human history, and more and more people come into contact with those who are different from them.
So the need to respect a neighbor who is not like you is much greater; but the scope to identify him or her as an enemy is also greater.
And this is not only about Islamic extremism.
There are extremist acts perpetrated against Muslims because of their religion, and today there are fanatical Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists who disfigure the true nature of their faith.
That is why education in the twenty-first century is a security issue for all of us.
The challenge is to show young people who are vulnerable to appeals from terrorists that there is a better path to having their voice heard, a more meaningful way to engage with the world.
The good news is that we know how to do this.
I use my Faith Foundation only as one example.
Our schools program promotes cross-cultural dialogue among students aged 12-17 around the world.
Reaching students in more than 20 countries, our program connects students via a secure Web site, where they interact from their classrooms under the guidance of trained teachers.
Through facilitated videoconferences, students discuss global issues from a variety of faith and belief perspectives.
They gain the dialogue skills required to prevent conflict by breaking down religious and cultural stereotypes.
For schools in the poorest areas, we use special arrangements, because they cannot access the Internet themselves.
To be sure, we are only a drop in the ocean.
But we now have experience in more than a thousand schools; over 50,000 students have been taught, and we are working in countries as diverse as Pakistan, India, the US, Jordan, Egypt, Canada, Italy, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
I have been privileged to witness these students becoming at ease with the cultures, faiths, and beliefs that inspire so many people around the world.
There are many other fantastic examples of this type of work.
But they lack the resources, weight, and recognition that they need.
We need to mobilize to defeat extremism.
And we need to act globally.
All governments must take seriously their responsibility to educate young people to accept and respect people of different faiths and cultures.
There is no issue that is more pressing.
There is a real danger that religious conflict replaces the ideologically based struggles of the last century in an equally devastating form.
It is up to all of us to show people that we have a better idea than the extremists have – to learn from each other and live with each other.
And this needs to be a core part of young people’s education.

A Special Moment for Special Drawing Rights
NEW YORK – The recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Lima, Peru, were dominated by talk of the weakness of several emerging and developing economies.
But the discussion focused very little on one key cause: the global monetary system.
Much more will be said next month at the IMF board, though what the Fund will do remains an open question.
The problem that emerging and developing economies are facing stems from the fact that their capital inflows follow a strongly pro-cyclical pattern.
When they were growing rapidly – especially compared to the advanced economies – they attracted massive amounts of capital.
But as risks multiplied, capital started to flow back toward a reserve-issuing country – namely, the United States.
After all, the US is set to raise interest rates, and the dollar has appreciated against virtually all of the world’s currencies.
In the past, this pattern has always ultimately led to a correction, with America’s growing current-account deficit eventually bringing about a dollar depreciation.
But such corrections – in 1979-1980, 1990-1991, and 2007-2008 – have also always been associated with a global slowdown or crisis.
This highlights the problem inherent in using the US dollar, a national currency, as the global economy’s primary international-reserve currency.
The Belgian economist Robert Triffin first identified this problem – dubbed the “Triffin dilemma” – in the 1960s, emphasizing the fundamental conflict between national objectives, such as limiting the size of the external deficit, and international imperatives, such as creating enough liquidity to satisfy demand for reserve assets.
Moreover, this system subjects the world economy to cycles of confidence in the US dollar, while placing the world economy at the mercy of a national authority – one that often makes decisions with scant regard for their international implications.
The only way to stabilize the system would thus be to place a truly global currency at its center.
This was the idea behind John Maynard Keynes’s proposal in the 1940s to create a supranational currency, called the “bancor.”
And it was the motivation behind the 1969 creation of the IMF’s Special Drawing Right (SDR), which was supposed to become “the principle reserve asset in the international monetary system.”
General SDR allocations are to be based on “a long-term global need to supplement existing reserve assets,” with decisions made for successive periods of up to five years.
So far, such allocations have been made only three times, in 1970-72, in 1979-81, and in 2009, with the latter allocation, amounting to $250 billion, being part of the recovery package adopted by the G-20 to manage the global financial crisis.
The SDR has been in the news again lately, owing to debate about whether the IMF should add the Chinese renminbi to the basket of currencies that determine the unit’s value.
Given the renminbi’s growing international role, it seems abundantly obvious that the currency should be part of the SDR basket.
Now, the discussion should focus on how to enable the SDR to reach its potential as an instrument of international cooperation.
The first step toward making SDRs a more active force in global finance would be to remove the division between SDR accounts and normal IMF operations.
As long as that partition remains in place, SDRs will function, at best, like a credit line that can be used unconditionally by the holder – a kind of overdraft facility, not a true reserve asset.
A better approach would be to allow countries to “deposit” unused SDRs in the Fund, so that they can be used to finance IMF lending operations.
In other words, issuing more SDRs would enable the IMF to finance more lending.
If those SDRs were issued during crises, like the one that emerging and developing economies are confronting today, the result would be a truly counter-cyclical global monetary policy.
This could even be taken one step further, with SDRs being allocated according to a new formula that accounts not just for IMF quotas, but also for demand (or need) for foreign-exchange reserves.
The current formula would have the countries most in need of foreign reserves – that is, middle- and low-income countries (excluding China) – receiving just over one-third of the total allocation.
That is not enough.
Even without this change, the SDR can and should gain a more prominent position in global reserves.
With emerging and developing economies in deepening trouble, there is no time to waste.
Some five decades after Triffin first identified the problems with the US dollar’s reserve-currency status, the SDR’s moment has, one hopes, finally arrived.

No Middle-Income Trap for China
BEIJING – There has always been a fixation on Chinese economic growth. And with good reason.
For a large economy, sustaining annual growth rates of 10% over several decades is unprecedented.
And yet that’s exactly what China did from 1980 to 2011.
But now the miracle is over.
Since 2012, annual growth has slowed to 7.2%, and Premier Li Keqiang’s recent annual “work report” set a growth target of just 6-6.5% for 2019.
For the vast legions of China doubters, this is a “gotcha” moment.
After all, the lower bound of the premier’s target implies a 40% deceleration from the “miracle” trend.
This seems to vindicate warnings of the dreaded “middle-income trap” – the tendency of fast-growing developing economies to revert to a much weaker growth trajectory just when they get their first whiff of prosperity.
The early work on this phenomenon was precise in terms of what to expect: as per capita income moved into the $16,000-$17,000 range (in 2005 dollars at purchasing power parity), a sustained growth deceleration of around 2.5 percentage points can be expected.
With China having hit that income threshold in 2017, according to International Monetary Fund estimates, its post-2011 slowdown looks all the more ominous.
But one of the first things taught to economics graduate students, even back in my day, is to be wary of the perils of data mining.
And the middle-income trap is a classic example of the pitfalls of endless number crunching.
Give me a database and a powerful computer, and I can “validate” almost any economic relationship masquerading as an analytical conjecture.
There are five key reasons to dismiss the now-widespread diagnosis that China is ensnared in the middle-income trap.
First, a middle-income trap may not even exist.
That is the conclusion of Lant Pritchett and Lawrence Summers’s rigorous empirical study covering a broad cross section of 125 economies from 1950 to 2010.
The best they could come up with is a strong tendency for growth discontinuities and mean reversion.
At the recent China Development Forum in Beijing, Summers went further in assessing likely outcomes in rapidly growing developing economies, dubbing any mean-reverting slowdown as merely a tendency to close a “post-miracle gap.”
Needless to say, the statistical regularity of such periodic growth gaps is very different from the permanent quagmire of a growth trap.
Second, a fixed trap threshold of $16,000-$17,000 may be a great literary device, but it makes little sense in a dynamic global economy.
Since early research on the middle-income trap was published in 2012, the world economy has grown by about 25% – presumably boosting the moving target of a middle-income threshold by a comparable magnitude over that period.
Largely for that reason, recent research has couched the trap not in terms of an absolute threshold, but as relative convergence to high-income countries.
From this perspective, danger looms when developing economies’ per capita income approaches 20-30% of the level in high-income economies.
Given that China will hit about 30% of America’s per capita GDP (in PPP terms) in 2019, it must be time to worry!
Third, not all growth slowdowns are alike.
A country’s GDP is a broad aggregation of a multiplicity of activities across sectors, businesses, and products.
Structural shifts from one sector to another can give the appearance of a growth discontinuity that may be nothing more than the outcome of a deliberate rebalancing strategy.
This is very much the case with China today, given its shift from higher-growth manufacturing and other “secondary” industries to slower-growing services, or “tertiary” industries.
To the extent that this shift is the intended result of China’s strategic rebalancing, a growth slowdown is far less alarming.
Fourth, the daunting challenges that China faces at this point in its economic development are far more important than whether its slowdown is a gap or a trap.
What comes after the catch-up to advanced economies operating on the technological frontier?
This is where China’s stated goal of shifting from imported to indigenous innovation comes in.
Middle- versus high-income status is a relative comparison for developing economies seeking to operate on that frontier.
Notwithstanding the temporary effects of periodic exogenous disturbances – such as deleveraging, global slowdowns, or even trade wars – catching up to the frontier and joining others pushing to move beyond it is the ultimate reward of economic development.
That goal is enshrined in President Xi Jinping’s aspiration for China to achieve high-income status by 2050.
Lastly, productivity growth is far more important than GDP growth in determining a country’s development prospects.
As such, I would be far more worried about China falling into a productivity trap than a GDP growth trap.
A new study on total factor productivity by a team of Chinese researchers offers some comfort here.
Like the work of Pritchett and Summers, this latest assessment of Chinese TFP growth reveals several discontinuities over the past 40 years.
But the underlying trend for the past five years is encouraging: annual TFP growth of around 3%, with especially strong growth in the tertiary sector.
So, notwithstanding the recent slowdown in aggregate GDP growth, services-led Chinese rebalancing is imparting meaningful productivity leverage to the economy as a whole.
The question now is whether China can sustain its recent TFP trajectory – a distinct possibility in light of an increasingly powerful shift to indigenous innovation and the sustained services-led productivity of a growing cohort of well-educated knowledge workers – and also reap the benefits of continued upgrading of its capital stock.
If it can, the new Chinese study concludes that China’s potential GDP growth rate could hold at nearly 6% over the next five years.
Such an outcome would conform quite closely with China’s longer-term ambitions.
So, yes, the days of 10% Chinese growth are over.
That was inevitable.
But there is good reason to believe that the real story is the shift in Chinese output from quantity to quality.
That suggests that China will defy yet again widespread fears of a looming middle-income trap.

The Six-Day War at 50
NEW YORK – The world is about to mark the 50th anniversary of the June 1967 war between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and Syria – a conflict that continues to stand out in a region with a modern history largely defined by violence.
The war lasted less than a week, but its legacy remains pronounced a half-century later.
The war itself was triggered by an Israeli preemptive strike on the Egyptian air force, in response to Egypt’s decision to expel a United Nations peacekeeping force from Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula and to close the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping.
Israel struck first, but most observers regarded what it did as a legitimate act of self-defense against an imminent threat.
Israel did not intend to fight on more than one front, but the war quickly expanded when both Jordan and Syria entered the conflict on Egypt’s side.
It was a costly decision for the Arab countries.
After just six days of fighting, Israel controlled the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza strip, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and all of Jerusalem.
The new Israel was more than three times larger than the old one.
It was oddly reminiscent of Genesis: six days of intense effort followed by a day of rest, in this case the signing of a cease-fire.
The one-sided battle and its outcome put an end to the notion (for some, a dream) that Israel could be eliminated.
The 1967 victory made Israel permanent in ways that the wars of 1948 and 1956 did not.
The new state finally acquired a degree of strategic depth.
Most Arab leaders came to shift their strategic goal from Israel’s disappearance to its return to the pre-1967 war borders.
The Six-Day War did not, however, lead to peace, even a partial one.
That would have to wait until the October 1973 war, which set the stage for what became the Camp David Accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty.
The Arab side emerged from this subsequent conflict with its honor restored; Israelis for their part emerged chastened.
There is a valuable lesson here: decisive military outcomes do not necessarily lead to decisive political results, much less peace.
The 1967 war did, however, lead to diplomacy, in this case UN Security Council Resolution 242.
Approved in November 1967, the resolution called for Israel to withdraw from territories occupied in the recent conflict – but also upheld Israel’s right to live within secure and recognized boundaries.
The resolution was a classic case of creative ambiguity.
Different people read it to mean different things.
That can make a resolution easier to adopt, but more difficult to act on.
It thus comes as little surprise that there is still no peace between Israelis and Palestinians, despite countless diplomatic undertakings by the United States, the European Union and its members, the UN, and the parties themselves.
To be fair, Resolution 242 cannot be blamed for this state of affairs.
Peace comes only when a conflict becomes ripe for resolution, which happens when the leaders of the principal protagonists are both willing and able to embrace compromise.
Absent that, no amount of well-intentioned diplomatic effort by outsiders can compensate.
But the 1967 war has had an enormous impact all the same.
Palestinians acquired an identity and international prominence that had largely eluded them when most were living under Egyptian or Jordanian rule.
What Palestinians could not generate was a consensus among themselves regarding whether to accept Israel and, if so, what to give up in order to have a state of their own.
Israelis could agree on some things.
A majority supported returning the Sinai to Egypt.
Various governments were prepared to return the Golan Heights to Syria under terms that were never met.
Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and signed a peace treaty with Jordan.
There was also broad agreement that Jerusalem should remain unified and in Israeli hands.
But agreement stopped when it came to the West Bank.
For some Israelis, this territory was a means to an end, to be exchanged for a secure peace with a responsible Palestinian state.
For others, it was an end in itself, to be settled and retained.
This is not to suggest a total absence of diplomatic progress since 1967.
Many Israelis and Palestinians have come to recognize the reality of one another’s existence and the need for some sort of partition of the land into two states. But for now the two sides are not prepared to resolve what separates them.
Both sides have paid and are paying a price for this standoff.
Beyond the physical and economic toll, Palestinians continue to lack a state of their own and control over their own lives.
Israel’s objective of being a permanent Jewish, democratic, secure, and prosperous country is threatened by open-ended occupation and evolving demographic realities.
Meanwhile, the region and the world have mostly moved on, concerned more about Russia or China or North Korea.
And even if there were peace between Israelis and Palestinians, it would not bring peace to Syria, Iraq, Yemen, or Libya.
Fifty years after six days of war, the absence of peace between Israelis and Palestinians is part of an imperfect status quo that many have come to accept and expect.

The Fusion Myth
France is now rushing to construct the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, (ITER), which is supposed to show that nuclear fusion can be used to power nuclear power stations.
ITER is often presented as the long-term solution to the problem of global warming, because nuclear fusion can provide an infinite and clean source of energy.
But ITER will do nothing of the sort.
In the fission reactions that nuclear power generation relies on today, heavy elements such as uranium break into smaller ones, while in nuclear fusion small elements such as hydrogen stick together and form heavier elements (helium).
Both fission and fusion produce a lot of energy.
Some political leaders explain that nuclear fusion is at work in the sun, and that, thanks to ITER, we will harness it.
They often add that, since fusion burns hydrogen, which can be found in seawater, it is an infinite source of energy.
Unfortunately, political leaders know little about the scientific issues involved.
That nuclear fusion is a source of energy has been known since the invention of the hydrogen bomb.
But its control is still a fundamental challenge for research institutes, not some minor technical difficulty that can be easily overcome.
Confining a little sun inside a box is an extremely difficult task for three main reasons.
First, the nuclear fuel is not seawater, but a mixture of the two heavy isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, a radioactive element that has been produced in small quantities for hydrogen bombs.
Any development of fusion reactors would require producing tritium with industrial methods that have yet to be invented.
Second, the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction starts at around 100 million degrees.
To achieve this requires using a magnet to accelerate a plasma that is a big flame of deuterium and tritium nuclei.
This must be done in a ultra-high vacuum in a large chamber.
ITER is not designed to produce electricity, but to study the stability of the flame in the magnet.
Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles, which pollute the plasma, one has to insert a “divertor” inside the flame at 100 million degrees in order to clean it.
Nobody has ever accomplished this, but ITER may be able to try around 2030 – that is, if it solves the previous problem.
Third, fusion also emits neutrons that will produce helium gas bubbles inside the wall material, which tends to explode.
The supporters of ITER explain that if the walls are porous, the bubbles can escape.
But nothing can be both leak-proof and porous, and ITER is not designed to study this contradiction.
In the future, a “blanket” should be inserted between the plasma and the walls, with two objectives: to protect the outer walls and to produce tritium from nuclear reactions within a circulating fluid containing lithium.
This might work, but the first wall of the blanket will need to be not only leak-proof and porous, but also sufficiently permeable to neutrons, which have to hit the lithium atoms beyond it.
The problem of materials is an entire research field in itself.
In order to study it, it has been decided to build the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) in Japan.
Some scientists have argued that the neutron irradiation in IFMIF won’t be the same as in fusion reactors, but it should be noted that its cost, at one billion euros, will be one-tenth that of ITER.
So why can’t we wait for IFMIF’s results before building ITER?
It all depends on one’s budget.
If ITER could really solve the planet’s energy problem, €10 billion would be a negligible investment – less than the net profit of the oil company TOTAL (€13 billion in 2006) and equivalent to ten days of waging the war in Iraq.
But if fusion is ever to work in industrial power stations, it will take many decades.
Even if ITER is successful, and if one solves the tritium and material problems, everything would need to be tested in real size, and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built.
A drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is an urgent priority, but fusion is unlikely to produce sufficient energy to achieve that goal before the twenty-second century.
In fact, ITER is a big instrument for fundamental research, so its €500 million Euros annual cost needs to be compared with similar scientific initiatives, such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), which costs one billion Swiss francs per year.
In my opinion, searching for the fundamental structure of particles is far more important than studying the stability of a plasma.
In France, the contribution to ITER is more than all the available funding for research projects in all our physics laboratories.
So the danger is that ITER will squeeze out funding for other vital research.
We already have the bad example of the International Space Station, a waste of $100 billion that has produced no scientific results.
ITER will not solve our energy problem.
Although it has some scientific interest in plasma physics, the participating countries should clearly state that funding it won’t affect the rest of their research efforts.
At the same time, the international community should support research on energy saving and storage, and accelerate the development of fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which will use fission and be both clean and durable.

Will the Supreme Court Create a Nation of Lawbreakers?
CHICAGO – The leak of a draft majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito suggests that the US Supreme Court is about to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion.
If it does, the Court will create a nation of lawbreakers, because many women will simply evade or violate restrictive state abortion laws.
But it will also create an even more unequal society, because poor women with unwanted pregnancies will have far fewer options than their wealthier counterparts.
I know this because I have studied the actual impact of Supreme Court decisions on abortion access for four decades.
Between the Roe decision and 2017 (the last year for which there are reliable numbers), more than 58 million abortions were performed in the US.
The Guttmacher Institute, which collects and reports the most reliable abortion data, estimates that one in four American women will have an abortion over the span of their reproductive years.
Given these figures, it is no wonder that nearly two-thirds of Americans support retaining the constitutional protection that Roe provides.
If Roe is overruled, many states will rush to impose severe restrictions or complete bans on abortion.
Thirteen states have so-called “trigger laws” that will automatically go into force, and at least a dozen others will move to pass new legislation almost immediately.
And yet decades of data show that these new restrictions will not prevent women in those states from terminating unwanted pregnancies.
In 1972, the year before Roe was decided, nearly 600,000 legal abortions – and likely hundreds of thousands of illegal procedures – were performed in the US.
Today, it’s estimated that more than 750,000 women have abortions every year.
Overturning Roe will not reduce the demand for abortion services nor the willingness of women to take extraordinary steps to terminate unwanted pregnancies.
But overturning Roe will not only fail to end abortion.
Mass evasion of state restrictions by hundreds of thousands of women each year will make a mockery of the law.
Tens of thousands already travel across state lines each year to secure access to abortion services, and abortion clinics in states such as California, Illinois, and New York are already raising funds and making plans to serve out-of-state patients.
Moreover, a growing list of major corporations – including Amazon, Apple, Citigroup, and Tesla – are including travel assistance for medical care as part of their employee benefits.
And some states where abortion will remain legal are considering providing funds to provide financial support for women from restrictive states.
In response, some anti-abortion states are threatening to make it illegal for women to cross state lines to seek an abortion, or for others to help them do so.
But how would a state government enforce such laws?
Will the police stop every car crossing the state line?
Will states try to extradite residents of other states who help women obtain legal abortions?
Even if they tried, would juries convict?
Given majority public support for abortion access, it is hard to imagine that anti-abortion states will have much success stopping women from traveling to terminate their pregnancies.
As for women who can’t afford to travel elsewhere, they, too, may still be able to obtain safe, albeit illegal, abortions.
In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in “medication abortions,” whereby an unwanted pregnancy is terminated simply by taking two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol.
The FDA has found these drugs to be safe and effective if taken within the first ten weeks of pregnancy.
As such, more than half of all abortions in the United States today are medication abortions.
Although some states may make obtaining and using these drugs illegal, medication abortions often take place in the privacy of women’s homes.
The pills are available either from doctors and abortion clinics in states where abortion is protected, through telemedicine where allowed, or by mail from other countries.
There are already groups in both Mexico and Europe that write prescriptions for abortion pills that are then sent to the US from India, and underground groups providing the pills to women in need are likely to emerge.
While states may try to stop the importation and distribution of abortion pills, America’s inability to stop the importation of illegal drugs such as cocaine suggests they will have a hard time doing so.
In addition to encouraging lawbreaking, overturning Roe will weaken democracy, because state bans on abortion will impose a disproportionately large burden on poor women, often of color.
These women may lack the time and resources to find childcare, travel to another state, arrange accommodations, obtain abortion pills, or pay for abortion services.
The Supreme Court will have made life even more difficult for the most vulnerable women in American society, reinforcing the growing belief that the system works only for the wealthy.
If the Court overturns Roe, it will create a nation of lawbreakers and increased inequality.
The justices should think again before making their draft opinion final.

DNA at 60
LONDON – On April 25, 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson published a one-page paper that many believed would revolutionize biological research.
Building on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they had discovered DNA’s double-helix structure, providing the first glimpse into how organisms inherit and store biological information.
But, 60 years later, has their discovery really had the transformative impact that the world expected?
The media marked the publication’s 60th anniversary with much fanfare, hailing the breakthrough that “ushered in the age of genetics,” and calling it “one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time.”
The British newspaper The Guardian featured the headline, “Happy Birthday, DNA!
The golden moment that changed us all.”
To some extent, they are right.
The finding forms the basis of genetics and has opened up promising new research areas, such as synthetic biology, in which biological systems are created or modified to perform specific functions.
Likewise, it has facilitated important innovations, such as pharmacogenetic cancer treatment, in which drugs target specific genetic defects within cancer cells.
Moreover, DNA has acquired a certain mystique in popular culture.
According to Dorothy Nelkin and Susan Lindee, it has become a sacred entity – the modern equivalent of the Christian soul, an individual’s essence.
While some forms of biological determinism, such as the belief that race or gender dictates a person’s destiny, have been widely rejected, the idea that a person can be genetically predisposed, say, to get into debt, become a ruthless dictator, or vote regularly in elections remains socially acceptable.
But, almost from the beginning – and most intensely since 1971, when Time magazine published a special section entitled “The New Genetics: Man into Superman” – science and society alike have tended to overestimate the impact of genetics.
When the Human Genome Project published the first draft of the fully sequenced human genome in 2000, Henry Gee, an editor of the journal Nature, predicted that scientists would be able “to alter entire organisms out of all recognition to suit our needs and tastes” by 2099.
“We will have extra limbs, if we want them,” he asserted, “maybe even wings to fly.”
Thirteen years later, Gee’s prediction looks increasingly unlikely, with the Human Genome Project so far having failed to meet expectations.
Indeed, in 2010, the science writer Nicholas Wade lamented that, a decade after the project was launched, geneticists were “almost back to square one in knowing where to look for the roots of common disease.”
For example, a 12-year study of 19,000 white American women found that 101 genetic markers that had been statistically linked to heart disease had no predictive value.
Self-reported family histories, by contrast, proved very accurate in predicting the disease.
In fact, most diseases are not caused by single genes.
As a result, after a few early successes with atypical single-gene disorders such as Huntington’s disease, progress has stalled.
Common variants typically explain a small fraction of genetic risk.
Genetics has been a source of particularly high hopes when it comes to cancer treatment.
Between 1962 and 1985, cancer-related deaths in the United States rose by 8.7%, despite the use of aggressive chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy, highlighting the dangers of a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment.
An understanding of the genetic determinants of patients’ therapeutic response, it was believed, would enable doctors to develop individualized treatment programs, sparing more responsive patients from harmful overtreatment.
But patients are not the only variable.
Cancer, too, is heterogeneous, even in patients with the same diagnosis.
After sequencing the entire genomes of 50 patients’ breast cancer tumors, researchers found that only 10% of the tumors had more than three mutations in common.
According to a recent study mapping genetic mutations in 2,000 tumors, breast cancer can actually be divided into ten subgroups.
Similarly, a genome-wide analysis of malignant cells from four kidney-cancer patients showed that, while they were related, they had mutated in many different directions.
Two-thirds of the genetic faults identified were not repeated in the same tumor, let alone in any other metastasized tumors in the body.
Given that a pharmacogenetic drug targets one mutation in the tumor, it will not necessarily work on the other mutations.
In addition, as the cancer adjusts to the drug, further mutations are likely to occur, diminishing the drug’s efficacy.
To be sure, pharmacogenetics has made a profound difference for some patients.
Barbara Bradfield, one of the original subjects in research trials for the pharmacogenetic cancer drug Herceptin, has now been stable on the drug for more than 20 years.
But such success stories are far too rare to constitute a “golden age” of genetics.
The high price of such drugs is limiting their impact as well.
Herceptin can cost up to $40,000 annually, and newer cancer drugs cost even more, making them prohibitively expensive for most patients.
The US Supreme Court is currently faced with the question of whether genes can be patented.
If the court upholds the biotechnology company Myriad Genetics’ patents on two genes which, in some variants, are linked to higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer, the company will retain exclusive rights to use the genes in research, diagnosis, and treatment for two decades, preventing rivals from developing cheaper alternatives.
Women have already been denied access to a diagnostic test, because insurers refuse to pay the company’s high prices.
Manufacturers claim that gene patents, which now cover 25-40% of the human genome, are vital to recouping their investments.
But such patents mar DNA’s “birthday” celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research – if only they could afford them.

Back to the Brink in Iran
PERTH – In the 43 years since its founding, Iran’s Islamic Republic has overcome numerous internal and foreign policy challenges.
But the massive public protests that erupted across the country last month following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after the morality police arrested her for “improperly” wearing her hijab, pose a major threat to the regime.
Iran is in the grip of what may be its most serious crisis.
When the Islamic Revolution toppled the pro-Western monarchy of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and installed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as the country’s Supreme Leader, Western observers doubted that a theocratic regime would last long.
Some analysts argued that religious fundamentalists could not possibly have the necessary skills or experience to run a sophisticated country like Iran.
But the regime has withstood all of its domestic challenges by combining a combative (jihadi) line with Khomeini’s pragmatic (ijtihadi) approach.
Khomeini’s successor, 83-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has followed his predecessor in balancing ideological and practical considerations to ensure the regime’s survival.
As Supreme Leader, Khamenei is the embodiment of the “sovereignty of God” – a status that has helped him to prevail over presidents and other elected officials who merely represented the sovereignty of the people.
When Khamenei sensed a serious threat to his authority and the state’s instruments of power, especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, he consented to internal reform and showed pragmatism in his foreign policy, supporting the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, for example, as an act of “heroic flexibility.”
But, otherwise, he has remained iron-fisted at home and defiant in the face of Western pressure over Iran’s nuclear program and regional influence.
But what Khamenei has failed to understand is that over time there would be a new generation of Iranians who have no memory of the 1979 revolution or allegiance to the Islamic Republic, especially when that regime has not served them well.
Despite Iran’s riches – especially its massive reserves of oil and natural gas – about 40% of Iranians live below the poverty line.
Decades of political oppression, widespread corruption, and economic mismanagement have gradually eroded public confidence in the Islamic Republic.
The COVID-19 pandemic and foreign-policy complications – including US-led sanctions and Iran’s involvement in several costly regional conflicts – have left many Iranians so disenchanted with the status quo that a nationwide uprising was only a matter of time.
The current protests follow previous waves of popular unrest that the government successfully suppressed, most notably the Green Movement demonstrations that erupted after the disputed presidential election of 2009.
The hardliners who created the Islamic system and control it today know that if the regime falls, they will go down with it, so they call in the riot police at the first sign of mobilized opposition.
But the regime may not be able to quell the protests indefinitely.
Young Iranians – roughly 65% of the country’s population – are fed up with the regime’s revolutionary rhetoric and theocratic dictates.
They want rights, freedoms, transparency, better living conditions, and a government that represents their interests.
The ruling clerics and their supporters have monopolized and mismanaged the economy’s commanding heights, leaving most of the population (which has nearly tripled in size since 1979) increasingly frustrated, desperate, fearful, and angry.
To be sure, the chances of overthrowing the Islamic regime appear slim.
But Iranians have a history of revolting against authoritarian impositions.
After all, the Islamic Revolution that ended the Shah’s rule followed two earlier attempts at pro-democratic reform.
One of these attempts ended in the 1953 CIA-orchestrated coup d’état that toppled the elected government of reformist Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and strengthened the monarchical rule of the Shah.
The Islamic Republic’s leaders have frequently cited the 1953 coup, exploiting the “hegemonic interventionism” of the United States to legitimize the regime, consolidate its power, and boost its regional influence.
But this formula no longer works on most Iranians, who blame the theocracy, not the Americans, for their grievances.
To stabilize their regime, Khamenei and his supporters must change course and empower reformist factions.
A decade ago, Iranian reformers, led by former President Mohammad Khatami, tried to make the Islamic Republic more tolerant and humane.
But the hardliners who still control the levers of power thwarted their efforts.
The unrest engulfing Iran today shows why structural reforms are urgently needed – and why this time, the clerics will find it much harder to preserve the regime with force alone.

The Plagues of Transition
It seems hardly worth noting that dictatorship and war are harmful to health.
Over 20 million died of starvation in Mao’s Great Leap Forward; untold millions died under Lenin, Stalin and Hitler; Pol Pot murdered two million Cambodians.
Accurate body counts from the cruel regimes presiding over Burma, Afghanistan and the Congo remain unavailable but are certainly huge.
During the past decade or so, greater peace and the fragile beginnings of democracy came to such troubled nations as South Africa, Mozambique, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.
Millions gained essential human and civil rights, including the right to criticize their leaders.
For many, the main struggle nowadays is finding a decent job and building a decent life.
You’d think health might be improving in the places that recently became more democratic.
But all is not well in such countries.
In many, political and economic transition brought new plagues every bit as horrible as those associated with repression and war.
During the 1980s, both Mozambique and South Africa, for example, were largely spared the HIV epidemic then devastating East and Central Africa.
Mozambique was at war: villages were isolated, and migrant workers, who would eventually bring the virus into the country, were few.
South Africa, too, had few cases before 1990, largely because apartheid’s influx controls, limited migration from countries where HIV was prevalent.
After apartheid’s fall and the end of the war in Mozambique, migration soared, so that the shanty-towns surrounding South Africa’s cities and mines became among the fastest growing in the world.
It is in such places – where the impoverished, lonely and displaced end up – that HIV puts down deep roots.
South Africa now has more people living with HIV than any other nation.
Meanwhile, in Russia, cases of drug resistant tuberculosis have risen sharply since 1990, especially in the nation’s overcrowded jails.
TB is hard to cure, because patients must take a combination of up to four drugs for at least six months; if patients do not complete the treatment, drug resistance commonly results.
Under the Soviet regime, drug treatment was usually available to prisoners with TB.
The collapse of the Soviet Union, however, saw health services collapse too; now patients may receive only part of the curative regimen.
Among ordinary Russians not in jail, alcoholic binges, drug abuse and other forms of self-destruction have incited a huge surge in death rates since 1990, rates which studies indicate have been rising fastest where the effects of political transition are most pronounced; that is, where unemployment and labor turnover rose most sharply.
Dictators and warlords, terrible as they are, cannot be solely blamed for these plagues of transition.
One pattern, however, seems to be emerging. The after-effects of transition are most deadly among populations made most vulnerable by generations of abuse and tyranny.
In South Africa, more than a century of white rule stifled the indigenous economy and established a migrant labor system throughout Southern Africa that disrupted families and created a social ecology favorable to the spread of HIV.
Health care systems that served blacks received a tiny fraction of the expenditure that white services did, so when HIV arrived, it encountered an extremely vulnerable population.
In Mozambique, war, partly abetted by the Cold War superpowers, left the country profoundly under-developed without health services or employment for it’s citizens.
In Russia, the Soviet system, which once invested heavily in heath care, allowed health systems to disintegrate after the economy stalled in the 1970s.
Then, in the 1990s, price increases and government spending cuts associated with the transition to a free market, served the coup de grace.
By contrast, during the past ten years in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, where Communist rule was less brutal than in Russia, health has improved.
Dictatorial regimes leave a terrible vacuum.
When they give way, disease, despair and death rush in.
But the plagues of transition are more than a health crisis; they signify a deeper malaise.
So put aside the fact that these diseases are infectious and can easily spread, or the idea that the fortunate bear some moral responsibility for the welfare of the poor and sick, and merely consider the economic consequences of the plagues of transition.
The World Bank calls AIDS “the foremost threat to African development.” Companies in South Africa stagger from losing so many workers to AIDS.
A generation of children from families ruined by AIDS, grow up without the care and education needed to become producers, let alone consumers.
Meanwhile, thousands of young Russians and Ukrainians languish in TB wards or succumb to alcohol and drug addiction.
All this disease and despair deserves more than sympathy, if only because in this globalizing world, the prosperity of one nation increasingly depends on the prosperity of others.
(Western investors were reminded of this when the Russian and Asian economies crashed in the late 1990s.)
Confronting the AIDS epidemic in the developing world will cost billions; so will rebuilding Russia’s health care system.
The longer we turn our backs, however, the more expensive solutions become and the less we can escape the fact that this is now our problem and our responsibility.

Fighting Polio to the Finish
WASHINGTON, DC – When I took my children to receive their polio vaccines a few years ago, I thought about how lucky we are to live in a place where we can access lifesaving interventions with such ease.
We didn’t need to take a long bus ride or walk great distances to get to the clinic, and there was no reason to think that there would be no doses in stock.
Although I was fully aware of the protection my children were receiving, I never considered that poliovirus could pose a real threat in Washington, DC.
After all, the virus hadn’t been found in the United States for years.
But recent developments are a wake-up call, underscoring just how critical something as simple and routine as vaccination can be.
In July, health authorities confirmed that polio had paralyzed an unvaccinated person in New York.
It was the first US case in nearly a decade.
Then, the virus was found in wastewater in other parts of New York State, which followed the news that London had also detected poliovirus in its sewage.
The World Health Organization has now declared both the US and the United Kingdom outbreak countries for variant poliovirus.
Globally, such stories are not unique.
Earlier this year, wild polio cases were confirmed in Africa for the first time in over five years, serving as a chilling reminder of how fragile the world’s progress against polio is.
While cases have plummeted by more than 99% since the 1988 launch of a global effort to eradicate the disease, the final stretch to absolute zero has been difficult, even though it is essential.
Fortunately, there is a global strategy in place to finish the job; but to succeed, it will need to be funded properly.
Launched last year, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s (GPEI) five-year Strategy is already being implemented to stop and prevent additional outbreaks.
At the strategy’s core are two priorities: working with at-risk countries to protect every child with vaccines, and improving surveillance to track the spread of the disease.
The same strategy is also helping to deliver other lifesaving vaccines to communities in remote areas, as well as working to strengthen health systems.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation joined the GPEI, alongside the WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2007, because we recognized the opportunity the world had to ensure that polio never paralyzed a child again.
That opportunity is even more apparent today.
Wild polio remains endemic in only two countries – Pakistan and Afghanistan – and though case numbers have risen slightly this year, they are still at extremely low levels.
There is not only a moral case for ending polio.
As a health economist, I also focus on the broader impact that such achievements can have.
For polio, the financial benefits of eradication would be enormous.
If we wipe out the poliovirus within the timeframe set by the current strategy, the world could save more than $33 billion this century, compared to the cost of continuing to control future polio outbreaks.
A growing chorus of stakeholders recognizes this financial dimension and the opportunity it represents.
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that provides support for routine immunization in 73 of the world’s poorest countries, joined the GPEI in 2019.
And just this month, more than a thousand global health experts and scientists from around the world signed a declaration urging countries to fund the global polio strategy fully.
Donors must heed this call and ensure that the GPEI receives the $4.8 billion it needs.
A fully funded strategy will be able to vaccinate 370 million children every year for five years, while also better preparing countries against future health threats.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, GPEI infrastructure was the first line of defense for many countries.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the polio program has lent support for contact tracing, disease surveillance, and community engagement, as well as facilitating the rollout of vaccines.
This is not a one-off example: GPEI has responded to threats such as Ebola, measles, and yellow fever, consistently demonstrating a high return on investment.
To be sure, the final stretch in the race against polio has proven the most difficult, and recent events have made matters more challenging.
The pandemic reversed progress on routine immunization globally.
Violent conflict, vaccine mistrust, and misinformation continue to present barriers in the last areas where polio hides.
Owing to this year’s devastating floods in Pakistan, efforts to stop polio from spreading there must be redoubled.
Still, while the destruction in Pakistan is staggering, it has been heartening to see the impressive response mounted by the government and the international community.
Additional support is still needed to prevent further hardship, because the high waters are impeding access to health care and accelerating the spread of waterborne diseases like polio, cholera, and typhoid.
There is no doubt that such conditions make it more difficult to stop polio.
But these challenges are not insurmountable.
GPEI partners and governments around the world have the collective experience and a clear plan to overcome them.
And this month at the World Health Summit in Berlin, donors have an opportunity to help achieve a polio-free world by pledging resources to the GPEI.
When we invest in polio eradication, we invest in a healthier world today and for generations to come.
That is why our foundation remains steadfastly committed to the GPEI’s mission.
We urge others to join us so that we can finally complete it.

Transforming Science Education
CHICAGO – Throughout the West, declining standards in science education are threatening future prosperity.
Since the mid-nineteenth century, the West has depended on technical innovation and scientific derring-do for its influence and growth.
But the West now faces serious competition from the rising nations of Asia, where education in math and science is flourishing.
In general, competition in science and technology is a blessing – the more advanced a nation is, the better a customer it is.
And collaboration and exchange of people make for profitable businesses and higher standards of living.
But it must be recognized that falling educational standards will eventually hit economic growth.
The West, particularly the United States, has lived through such a moment of recognition before, when the USSR launched Sputnik in 1957.
The so-called “Sputnik shock” convinced America and the West of the need for radical reform of science education, particularly recruitment, training, and retention of teachers.
One reform that demands priority today concerns high school science.
Mathematics, the foundation for all science, depends on its concise language and logical ordering.
Physics, once the subject most dependent on mathematics, provides knowledge about the structure of atoms, and the use of mathematics there has now spread to chemistry and biology.
Essentially all phenomena in chemistry find explanations in the quantum atom, while chemistry and physics undergird molecular biology, which, since the discovery of DNA in the 1950s, dominates modern biology.
All other sciences – geology, astronomy, neuroscience, oceanography, and myriad hyphenated subjects – depend upon overlapping combinations of biology, chemistry, and physics.
Yet today, the vast majority of high schools start the study of science with biology.
In America, the requirement is usually for three years of science study, and, today, most U.S. students take science in this order: biology, chemistry, physics.
This sequence of study was devised in 1893.
I believe that it is obsolete, pedagogically disastrous, and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century.
Other industrial nations may cycle through pieces of the disciplines, missing the essential coherence of the P-C-B sequence.
Studying science should begin with physics, not biology.
In studying physics, students study algebra simultaneously, motivating them with a sense of the power of mathematics.
Moreover, physics begins with everyday phenomena requiring few new words (as opposed to conventional ninth-grade biology): motion, velocity, acceleration, falling objects, a sense of gravity as a force, and some new concepts, e.g. mass, momentum, and energy, but with crisp definitions.
Ninth-grade physics, unlike ninth-grade biology, illustrates the grand sweep of the laws of nature, and the power of an equation to describe a vast number of different phenomena can be taught at this level.
Classroom experiments make use of simple laboratory devices: inclined planes, pulleys, springs, simple pendulums, but the rules that are revealed have validity out in the real world.
The fall of a weight (or an apple!) can be connected to the moon’s orbit around the earth and even to the structure of galaxies holding billions of solar systems.
Indeed, we can study, on a convenient classroom scale, the same forces that move atoms and planets.
The last month or more of ninth-grade physics introduces atoms, invisible to the naked eye but with strong indirect support.
Here physics introduces scales of distances, atoms to galaxies, scales of time, nanoseconds to centuries, and scales of energy from electron volts to megajoules.
These orders of magnitude require metaphors and repetition, but they serve as crucial concepts in our world, especially in cosmology and in evolutionary biology.
Tenth-grade chemistry makes use of ninth-grade physics, deepening and enriching the student’s grasp, but no basic chemical or biological principles are required for ninth-grade physics.
Instead, qualitative applications of physics to chemistry and biology heighten interest and emphasize the connections.
Chemistry is largely a study of molecules, and when they are complex, there is the mysterious transition to life and biology.
At all stages of the science curriculum, basic questions must be asked.
How does something work?
How do we know?
What are the common laws?
It was not a physicist, but a biologist, Julius Meyer, who first proposed the law of conservation of energy from a study of biological energy processes. The chemist Dalton first gave a proof of the existence of atoms and the engineer Sadi Carnot first gave a proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
The sequence Physics-Chemistry-Biology implies that continuous collegial professional development for teachers is essential.
Teachers (including those in mathematics) should meet regularly to plot the evolution of their courses, their essential coherence, and the inclusion of stories that illustrate how science works.
Teachers need time to talk together.
I know of more than 1,000 high schools that have implemented the P-C-B sequence.
There is almost universal joy as students begin to grasp the whole picture.
Elective science courses zoom up in popularity.
Because this sequence is for all students, what will be retained in the future are the stories and, most importantly, a scientific way of thinking.
There is no job, no profession, civic activity that will not profit from this kind of education.
But to restore the vitality of science, we need to look at the entire educational system: teachers from pre-school through high school, state and national standards, productive and educationally reinforcing assessments, teaching materials and educational technology, and progress in the neurosciences, cognitive psychology, developmental biology, and nutrition.
And leadership for this huge revolutionary effort will probably have to come from visionary business executives whose profits depend on education and rationality.

Ten Reasons for Europe
PARIS – The euro, many now believe, will not survive a failed political class in Greece or escalating levels of unemployment in Spain: just wait another few months, they say, the European Union’s irresistible collapse has started.
Dark prophecies are often wrong, but they may also become self-fulfilling.
Let’s be honest: playing Cassandra nowadays is not only tempting in a media world where “good news is no news”; it actually seems more justified than ever.
For the EU, the situation has never appeared more serious.
It is precisely at this critical moment that it is essential to re-inject hope and, above all, common sense into the equation.
So here are ten good reasons to believe in Europe – ten rational arguments to convince pessimistic analysts, and worried investors alike, that it is highly premature to bury the euro and the EU altogether.
The first reason for hope is that statesmanship is returning to Europe, even if in homeopathic doses.
It is too early to predict the impact of François Hollande’s election as President of France.
But, in Italy, one man, Mario Monti, is already making a difference.
Of course, no one elected Monti, and his position is fragile and already contested, but there is a positive near-consensus that has allowed him to launch long-overdue structural reforms.
It is too early to say how long this consensus will last, and what changes it will bring.
But Italy, a country that under Silvio’s Berlusconi’s cavalier rule was a source of despair, has turned into a source of real, if fragile, optimism.
A second reason to believe in Europe is that with statesmanship comes progress in governance.
Monti and Hollande have both appointed women to key ministerial positions.
Marginalized for so long, women bring an appetite for success that will benefit Europe.
Third, European public opinion has, at last, fully comprehended the gravity of the crisis.
Nothing could be further from the truth than the claim that Europe and Europeans, with the possible exception of the Greeks, are in denial.
Without lucidity born of despair, Monti would never have come to power in Italy.
In France, too, citizens have no illusions.
Their vote for Hollande was a vote against Sarkozy, not against austerity.
They are convinced, according to recently published public-opinion polls, that their new president will not keep some of his “untenable promises,” and they seem to accept this as inevitable.
The fourth reason for hope is linked to Europe’s creativity.
Europe is not condemned to be a museum of its own past.
Tourism is important, of course, and from that standpoint Europe’s diversity is a unique source of attractiveness.
But this diversity is also a source of inventiveness.
From German cars to French luxury goods, European industrial competitiveness should not be underestimated.
The moment when Europe truly believes in itself, the way Germany does, and combines strategic long-term planning with well allocated R&D investments, will make all the difference.
Indeed, in certain key fields, Europe possesses a globally recognized tradition of excellence linked to a very deep culture of quality.
The fifth source of optimism is slightly paradoxical.
Nationalist excesses have tended to lead Europe to catastrophic wars.
But the return of nationalist sentiment within Europe today creates a sense of emulation and competition, which proved instrumental in the rise of Asia yesterday.
Koreans, Chinese, and Taiwanese wanted to do as well as Japan.
In the same way, the moment will soon come when the French want to do as well as Germany.
The sixth reason is linked to the very nature of Europe’s political system.
Churchill’s famous adage that democracy is the worst political system, with the exception of all the others, has been borne out across the continent.
More than 80% of French citizens voted in the presidential election.
Watching on their televisions the solemn, dignified, peaceful, and transparent transfer of power from the president they had defeated to the president they had elected, French citizens could only feel good about themselves and privileged to live in a democratic state.
Europeans may be confused, inefficient, and slow to take decisions, but democracy still constitutes a wall of stability against economic and other uncertainties.
The seventh reason to believe in Europe is linked to the universalism of its message and languages.
Few people dream of becoming Chinese, or of learning its various languages other than Mandarin.
By contrast, English, Spanish, French, and, increasingly, German transcend national boundaries.
Beyond universalism comes the eighth factor supporting the EU’s survival: multiculturalism.
It is a disputed model, but multiculturalism is more a source of strength than of weakness.
The continent’s fusion of culture makes its people richer rather than poorer.
The ninth reason for hope stems from the EU’s new and upcoming members.
Poland, a country that belongs to “New Europe,” is repaying the EU with a legitimacy that it had gained from Europe during its post-communist transition.
And the entrance of Croatia, followed by Montenegro and a few other Balkan countries, could compensate for the departure of Greece (should it come to that for the Greeks).
Finally, and most important, Europe and the world have no better alternative.
The Greek crisis may be forcing Europe to move towards greater integration, with or without Greece.
The German philosopher Jürgen Habermas speaks of a “transformational reality” – a complex word for a simple reality: divided we fall, whereas united, in our own complex manner, we may strive for “greatness” in the best sense.
Investors, of course, are hedging their bets.
Having ventured successfully into emerging non-democratic countries whose frailty they are starting to fear, some, out of prudence, are starting to rediscover Europe.
They may well be the wise ones.

Judging Bush's Military Tribunals
Britain continues to be America's staunchest ally in the US-led war in Iraq, and Prime Minister Tony Blair remains unwavering in his support.
But his government does have a serious quarrel with the Bush administration.
The American President's designation of two Britons to be among the first six of 680 prisoners held at the US base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to face a military trial has been condemned across the political spectrum in the United Kingdom.
The British are not alone.
Worldwide, the detentions at Guantanamo Bay and President Bush's military tribunals have become symbols of America's readiness to abandon concern for rights in the name of the struggle against terrorism.
Indeed, one senses a certain satisfaction in some countries that have been the targets of human rights criticism by the US; now they sense an opportunity to turn the tables.
Whether denunciations of the detentions at Guantanamo and the planned military tribunals are driven by genuine concerns about human rights or by glee at pointing out American hypocrisy, the effect is the same.
Because the US is such an outspoken proponent of human rights internationally, its failure to respect rights assumes added significance, contributing to a rising tide of anti-Americanism in much of the world.
The Bush administration has only itself to blame for this state of affairs.
The creation of Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo, and President Bush's executive order establishing military commissions to try those held there, aimed to deal with prisoners seized during the war in Afghanistan whom the US considered to be ``unlawful combatants.''
That is, the Bush administration believed that they were al Qaeda members or others who did not fight by the rules of war and thus not entitled to prisoner-of-war status.
Potentially, there are three bodies of law that could govern the treatment of these prisoners:
domestic American law in accordance with the rights guaranteed by the US Constitution;
international human rights law to which the US is a party through its membership in the UN and its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
international humanitarian law--also known as the laws of war--to which the US is also a party through its ratification of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and through its acceptance that certain provisions of the First Additional Protocol of 1977 have the status of customary international law that is binding on America as on all other governments.
In practice, the Bush administration rejects application of any of these bodies of law to the Guantanamo prisoners.
Instead, President Bush asserts the power to hold them indefinitely at Guantanamo or, in his unreviewable discretion, to bring them to trial before military commissions that deny them the due process protections to which they would be entitled if any of the three legal systems were followed.
The Bush administration's argument for not applying domestic law is that the prisoners are not American citizens and are not held on American territory.
Guantanamo was selected as the site to imprison them in a deliberate--and successful--effort to prevent American civilian courts asserting their jurisdiction.
As far as international human rights law is concerned, the Bush administration has been silent.
But its fundamental position is that treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are not self-executing.
Hence, they accord no rights to the prisoners at Guantanamo in the absence of implementing legislation.
It is the Geneva Conventions and the First Additional Protocol that create the greatest difficulties for the Bush administration.
The Conventions require that, where there is any doubt, a hearing must be held before an impartial tribunal to determine whether a prisoner seized during an armed conflict is entitled to prisoner-of-war status.
Since no such hearings have been held, the Bush administration is effectively claiming that there is no doubt in the case of any detainee.
As in other instances where government officials claim unanimity--such as Saddam Hussein's assertion that he obtained 100% of Iraqis' support in the plebiscite that he conducted shortly before the war--America's position is simply not credible.
It amounts to a determination that all the detainees at Guantanamo are guilty of being unlawful combatants without any proceedings or any opportunity for them to defend themselves.
Moreover, even if they are found to be unlawful combatants, the First Additional Protocol of 1977 requires that they be afforded certain due process protections, which will not be available to those brought before the proposed military commissions.
The commissions may even sentence detainees to death, with no appeal to a civilian court whatsoever.
Little wonder, then, that Tony Blair's government is angry that two of its citizens will be tried before President Bush's military commissions.
Up to now, criticism from the rest of the world has had no effect on the Bush administration's plans.
It remains to be seen whether protests by an ally who has stood by America so loyally, and at such great cost to his own political standing, will have a greater impact.

Put Central Bankers in Their Place
LONDON – In the Forbes list of the World’s Most Powerful People for 2012, Ben Bernanke, then the chair of the US Federal Reserve, held the sixth position, while Mario Draghi, then the president of the European Central Bank, came in at number eight.
They were both ranked above Chinese President Xi Jinping.
As the global economy struggled with the aftermath of the global financial crisis that began in 2008, and its European cousin, the eurozone crisis, central banks were in the driving seat, easing quantitatively like there was no tomorrow.
They were, it was often said, “the only game in town.” Even at the time, some thought there was an element of folie de grandeur in their elevation.
This time is different.
Although central banks continue to buy bonds incontinently, fiscal policy has been the key response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the United States, President Joe Biden and Congress have led the charge.
In the European Union, the European Commission’s Recovery and Resilience Facility is at the heart of the €750 billion ($884 billion) Next Generation EU plan, while in the United Kingdom, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is signing the checks.
So are central bankers’ noses out of joint, as they play second fiddle to the finance ministries, a position in the orchestra to which few aspire?
It seems that they are, as the last 18 months have seen a remarkable expansion of the central banks’ fields of activity, largely driven by their own ambitions.
So they have moved into the climate change arena, arguing that financial stability may be put at risk by rising temperatures, and that central banks, as bond purchasers and as banking supervisors, can and should be proactive in raising the cost of credit for corporations without a credible transition plan.
That is a promising new line of business, which is likely to grow.
Central banks are also trying to move into social engineering, specifically the policy response to rising income and wealth inequality, another hot button topic with high political salience.
In part, this new interest in inequality is a defensive move.
Central banks have been stung by growing criticism that their policy mix of low or even negative interest rates, combined with quantitative easing, has given the wealthier members of society huge uncovenanted gains by pushing up asset prices.
Those fortunate members of society with money to invest in stocks, high-end property, and expensive artworks have seen their net worth grow rapidly as funds flowed into appreciating assets.
So central bankers have been forced to defend their actions and to attempt to prove that, taken in the round, the chosen policy mix has also benefited poorer families by sustaining jobs.
Some have been convinced by that argument; others not so much.
The mixed reaction has drawn a further response from monetary authorities.
One element has been rhetorical.
In 2009, less than 0.5% of all central bankers’ speeches recorded on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) database mentioned inequality, or the distributional consequences of their policies.
In 2021, the figure is 9%, almost 20 times as many.
But talk is cheap.
Is there any evidence that a concern for inequality has influenced policy?
Indeed, is there any evidence that monetary policy can be used to moderate or reverse growing inequality?
The Chief Economist of the BIS, Claudio Borio, believes there is.
He argued at the end of last month that “there is a lot that monetary policy can do to foster a more equitable distribution over business cycles.”
Part of the argument is traditional, drawn from the textbook of central banking 101.
He refers to “the havoc that high inflation can wreak on the poorer segments of society,” and shows that income inequality tends to decline when inflation averages less than 5%.
So far, so conventional.
But he accepts that there can be a problem if interest rates are kept low for a long time to fight off recession.
In those circumstances, “there may be a trade-off in terms of wealth inequality.”
That is particularly true, he thinks, in the case of financial recessions, which can be more long-lasting, and where interest rates need to be held down for a long period to allow credit excesses to be worked off.
So, what is the answer?
It is “a more holistic macro-financial stability framework.”
Oh, dear.
I have nothing against holism, I should add.
But it can be vague as a guide to policy.
In this case, what it primarily means is that governments should offset the impact of loose monetary policy on income and wealth inequality by the use of fiscal policy to ensure that post-tax inequality is moderated.
They should also work on labor-market regulation to rebalance bargaining power in favor of employees.
And they should invest more in education.
These are all, of course, Good Things, but they take us away from central banking.
Can central banks really do no more than pass the buck to the Ministries of Finance and Economy?
Not quite: if they are financial regulators, they can help promote financial inclusion and literacy, but that takes decades to have an impact.
It may be, too, that macroprudential policies can be used to smooth credit booms and busts, which may reduce the scale of the problem low interest rates are designed to resolve.
It is too soon since their introduction after the financial crisis to know whether that will turn out to be the case.
The slightly depressing conclusion is that the current monetary policy settings in the world’s developed economies are likely to create greater wealth inequality, and that in the short term there is not a lot monetary and regulatory authorities can do about it, save mentioning it in speeches.
If the problem is to be resolved, we will need to see finance ministers with a strong political mandate to implement redistributional policies, rather than Fed chairmen and governors featuring prominently in this decade’s power lists.

Tackling the COVID Hunger Crisis
LONDON – Today, 270 million people – equivalent to the combined population of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy – are on the brink of starvation.
This number has doubled over the last 12 months.
And it is the world’s children who are suffering most.
An estimated 11 million children under the age of five face extreme hunger or starvation in 11 countries in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Asia.
Of these, 168,000 will die of malnutrition by the end of 2022 unless they receive emergency support.
And a total of 73 million primary schoolchildren in 60 low-income countries are chronically hungry.
Hunger was already on the rise before the coronavirus pandemic, mostly as a result of war and conflict, and climate change exacerbated it.
But the secondary effects of the pandemic have created a global hunger crisis.
One reason for this is that COVID-19 has broken the lifeline of school.
More than 1.6 billion children have missed time in the classroom since the pandemic began, and nearly 200 million are still not back at school.
Previous crises have shown that school closures carry huge social and economic costs, including increases in child marriage and child labor.
Some young people end up paying the ultimate price: complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for girls aged 15-19 in low- and middle-income countries.
Ultimately, crises reverse progress on ensuring that all girls have access to quality education.
Moreover, schools provide many poor children with their only nutritious meal of the day.
School closures mean that millions of children have lost their opportunity not only to learn, but also to eat.
Children have missed more than 39 billion school meals during the crisis.
Women and girls are often the first to miss meals, and account for more than 70% of people facing chronic hunger.
The damage caused by just a few weeks of missed nutrition can stunt a hungry child for a lifetime, and malnutrition can stunt a country’s economic progress for a generation.
So, getting children back into school where they can be educated and fed must be a high priority.
With relatively little money, the international humanitarian system has achieved much.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), for example, feeds around 100 million people per year.
And when COVID-19 severely disrupted commercial airline services, the UN created a logistics system to transport health and humanitarian workers and vital supplies, including food.
But a crisis on this scale requires an ambitious plan that involves more than just providing school meals.
Humanitarian organizations can’t do it alone.
At their June summit, the wealthy G7 economies should commission a long-term plan to address rising global food needs.
The plan should include provisions for pre-emptive action: building up food stocks, developing insurance as a protection, and supporting developing-country farmers and food growers with long-term investments to help them become self-sufficient.
Policymakers must also adopt innovative ways to generate financing, including guarantee-based facilities that can maximize the use of development aid and private-sector funding, which was at the heart of the 2015 Addis Ababa proposals for financing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Another priority could be a closer partnership between the UN and the World Bank – the one wholly global organization capable of mobilizing substantial additional resources on a sustained basis.
But there is a very simple, common-sense solution to the immediate crisis: new international money.
At least $600 billion in Special Drawing Rights (the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset) can be allocated to poorer countries.
Leaders and lenders can agree on up to $80 billion of debt relief on the condition that the money goes to education, health, and nutrition.
And the World Bank and regional development banks can rapidly expand grants and loans.
With around $10 billion this year, the world could stave off famine in Yemen, South Sudan, northeast Nigeria, and the Sahel.
And it could prevent mass hunger – which immediately precedes famine – in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia’s Tigray region, and other vulnerable places.
This may sound like a lot of money.
But it’s the equivalent of a dollar a month from each person in the world’s richest economies, and represents a fraction of 1% of wealthy countries’ pandemic-related stimulus spending.
We need to move quickly.
This means giving grants up front to the WFP and leading NGOs like Save the Children to feed hungry children and their families.
With only 31% of refugee children enrolled at the secondary level, and just 27% of girls, Education Cannot Wait – which helps displaced children into school and has raised almost $1 billion in its short existence – needs to be fully funded.
By directing additional resources to education, we can get 136 million children in some of the poorest and most conflict-affected countries back in school – and help them stay there.
COVID-19 has also exposed another educational divide: two thirds of the world’s school-age children lack internet access at home, which prevents them from online learning.
Today, only 5% of children in low-income countries have such access, compared to 90% in high-income countries.
A UNICEF-led project to connect the world could bridge this gaping digital divide.
The UK government has pledged to play a leading global role in getting all children into school and ensuring that girls receive 12 years of education.
But we will not achieve that noble objective unless the G7 summit addresses this issue, in addition to food security.
Time and again, education has demonstrated its power to transform individuals, families, and entire countries.
But chronic hunger can have devastating consequences: cruel and preventable deaths, violent conflict, and mass displacement.
Ignoring the global scourge of hunger is thus not an option.
What happens in the world’s most fragile places has knock-on effects in the most stable countries.
The choice facing world leaders is simple: act now to tackle the hunger crisis, or pay a much higher price later.
Immediate action will be cheaper and save more lives than responding only after multiple famines have taken hold and a generation’s missed education has exacted a terrible toll.
